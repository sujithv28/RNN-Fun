I'mma tell you this for your own benefit
Your shit was dope as hell, specially when you wrote 90% of it
What you need to do is practice on your freestyles
'fore you come up missin' like Snoop Dogg's police files
This type of shit? bitch be sure that I'm spittin'
Be hittin', you gonna pray to God this shit was written
But it wasn't I'll kill a dozen rappers when I buzzin'
Guzzlin', beat your ass like a jealous husband
Now whos ya boy? bitch you about to suffer and see north
When you go in a coma longer than Vladamir Konstastinov
Cut the damn machine off
Get a clean cloth, and wipe this bloody video screen off

_________________________________________________________________

I'm movin' in for the kill, plus I got the trap set
I can tell you're wack as fuck, and I ain't even hear you rap yet
Look at you thinkin I'm about to whip his ass
Cause I'm a do some written shit, plus I get to go last
Well guess what ? even if I go first, it's no worse
My shit's still gon' demolish yo verse
I'm bout to slice you like a ginsu
And anything you say can and will be used against you
In a court of law, I'm short and raw
Take you fuckin' shit and cut it off
Yo, you wanna be a dope MC?
Look, don't get mad and start taking your period out on me

_________________________________________________________________

You wanna represent on the microphone but you rap sleazily
I ain't about to battle this fake ass Eazy-E
There ain't no way I'm a do this bullshit
I don't give a fuck, I'm loaded up with a full clip
Time of the month, you couldn't get the tape of the day
Take him away, I ripped him like a paper mache
I've heard you rap before, you ain't about shit
This whole battle was mismatched like your outfit
Try to battle me and get your mouth split
You sold out like Ticketmaster Outlet
Ha ha, I bust and I crush, I don't give a fuck
Ain't no way that you can fuck with us
I'm givin back with pimp shit
I'll laminate that ass in a badge and wear it at the Rap Olympics

_________________________________________________________________

Blah-badee-blah-da-blah-blah, stop babblin'
You so fuckin' wack I'm a walk away while you battlin'
Fuck that, I'm on a brand new solo mission
To make sure that Wendy Day kicks your ass out of the rap coalition
I throw a switch at an execution
With an overdose of devotion don't talk back, I'm the dope, bitch
So who you sound like on the mic?
There was only one 2Pac, your thug style's just one Big Syke
Take a big hike, bitch you can't catch me
Your best rhymes still ain't shit like a patsy
What the fuck you gonna do?
I'll battle anybody in your crew and I don't give a fuck
I slaughter boys, especially wack ass emcees
That will wear a fake ass corduroy

_________________________________________________________________

I'm bout to make this mic short circuit
This beat is wack as fuck, this shit fits you perfect
I got so many ways to diss you that I'm playful with'ch you
I'll let a razor slit you 'til they have to staple stitch you
And everybody in this fuckin' place'll miss you
If you try to turn my facial tissue to a racial issue
Nobody's hearin' you, you're a wack liar
Damn, all you white jokes just backfired
Cause bitch you walkin' up the wrong street
Now go tell all your boys you was beat by a honkey
I don't give a fuck, I'll kill ya, bitch
You better recognize me like a look familiar
Anything you say I'm a kill ya, grill ya
When I fuckin' drill ya I'm Marsh but you're the one that's mellow[Intro]
Hi kids, do you like Kim's bullshit? (No!)
Wanna see me stick her fucking eyeballs right in to my anus?

I got a fucking time traveling machine to go back all to this
And see all the piss that she gave me, bitch
She made me fall on my ass
The walls are caving in and I gotta go ham on this bitch
Like, woah, so we never fell in love so I didn't have to
Go through that shit no more
It's like a nugget, I'm hugging these sluts
That are bothering this fucking chick when I murder
And spit on the beat like the drugs I was taking
Just a bit of it
And stop slurping the blood off her face, or I'll murder you too with a bag full of mace and if Kim comes to my house and says "Wanna get back together?"
And I say "No, get out before I [slit your throat] and splatter the blood on this sweater!"
Blue eyes, red eyes, green eyes, bloody eyes
Hi Mom, you're back again, rock climbing my dick to see how famous my fucking life is?

1980, still feeling shady, 1983, bitch never leave me
1987, met this bitch in heaven, 1999, my life was very deprived
I said hey, do you want me? I'm still feeling kinda shady
1999, we got 3 babies, 1999, will you ever leave me?
Because back then, I was kind of shady

Ring around the rosie, pocket full of posie
Kim, Kim, be shady like me, I'm trying for the 4th
Stop being a bitch, please, walking across the highway
Playing Chicken, while brains splatter all over the road like
"ricken, ricken", my phone's dead, now how can I call the bitch?
I'll use the payphone, this bitch is calling my dead phone, she won't leave me alone
Spent 75 cents on her, and she didn't answer
Now I'll come to her house and [slaughter her ancesters]
Boo! I'm a ghost, you happy to see me? I'm taking your soul
Well shit, you don't believe me? Boom, I did it, do you believe me now? Shit whatever, I'm the king so hand me the crown


1999, the slut's pussy is so dry, I said 1999, the slut's pussy is so dry, no other faggot can control my lifeHow the fuck he got an Oscar
Passed out in his red Mazda
With his fucking head in his pasta
In the parking lot of K-Mart plaza
Across from the Red Lobster
Looking like the Loch Ness Monster
Dressed like a cross-dressed mobster
Talk is cheap, it costs less to gossip
I'll probably be a lot less hostile
If you snots kept your schnozzes out the air holes
You'll get fucked in all seven holes
Ass, mouth, pussy yeah, both ears and ha yes nostrils
At the OzzFest with Nas
Bumping Das EFX in a wrecked up Datsun
And dropped two extra strength Watson Vicodin out my pocket
They cost less
I'm a hot mess
Cause I tripped and got my head stuck
In a wasps nest in the process, awesome
Drunk as fuck, one sock
Pulling my boxers up with boxing gloves
But I keep dropping my fucking binoculars
Got two fucking Hydroxycuts
And four oxi’s stuck in my esophogus
These three lesbian little stocky sluts
Thought I swallowed two hockey pucks
Started screaming "serves you right you cocky fuck
That's what you get for mocking us
Ain't as cool as you thought you was"
Bitch all I did when I walked up was have my dick in a sock
Said it was a sock puppet
So no strings attached
You can all suck it
Chicka get it, ah fuck it
Shit’s bout to get as hairy as motherfucking Chewbaca's nuts
Cocksuckas[Royce da 5'9"]
Ryan's a homicidal misfit, I write the solution of biophysics
On the side of a cliff in some hieroglyphics
This my admission to having violent psychotic wit
Devour, polish it, politics
By the way I'm higher than the Eiffel Tower tip
I like writing, but I will stick this pencil in your ass
Before I write your shit, pause, inhaling hella kush
Us and Yelawolf like a heavy foot gas pedal push
Felons, crooks, going door-to-door
Like we selling books, Dolly Parton style, melons mushed
Now my bitch a dancer, I'm about as sick as cancer
If you could swallow my style, you'd probably rip your pants up
If you could bottle my style and sell it to somebody
It probably will smell like cologne made out of bits of panther
They call me Anchorman, I hold down the ship
Leave you niggas floating in water, then go and drown a fish
Fuck, I'm fucking heinous, I make you fucking famous
Them lead showers is coming, fuck is you saying?

FUCK! It's fucking raining, SHIT! There's lightning, BITCH!
It's thundering cause I'm cussing up a storm if you wondering, SHIT!
SHIT! You couldn't muster up enough thought
To take a dump during a brain fart, chump
If you want urine in your face, all you had to do was say
That you wish you would've just stayed pissed off in the first place
We came to monopolize the game, illuminati is here
Yeah, human oddities, at odds with us, your squad's gotta be
Cause we started out cold in a snowball, we froze
Soon as we rolled up on these hoes, all's we know
Is y'all lowered the bar like limbo, you know who you are
So quit fucking the dog before we start calling YOU Bizarre
Shit, screw the pooch, y'all done raped a pitbull
Fell in love with the shih-tzu, this missile's directed directly at you
And this for these hoes who don't know me from a can of paint
You must be huffing, fuck a ball sack
If the taints can't take you on a date, you mistake me for a gentleman
You 2000 and late, man, and Will I ain't, I'm the bad guy
Type of guy that will drag five girls up on stage
Pour ice in their pants, and the first one who pees gets a black eye

Must be outta your mind, you think you fucking with us
Suck on these nuts, bitch, hang it up, this game is over

Puffin' loosies, watching "I Love Lucy" with Gary Busey
Crazy, how the fuck could you son me? I'm Shady
Will there ever come a day when they could slay me?
I don't know, fifth month, black and yellow insect, maybe
'Til then I kill the bad man trying to slay me
Everything you kick weak, your spit kung fughesi
All my homeboys, 2.0 Boys
Nickel, I just picked up a Phantom, look how it rolls, Royce
Even if I wanted to quit, I ain't got no choice
Verses keep coming, I should invoice my own voice
You should see the kind of asses that my pole hoist
Hoes be like diamonds in your chain, man, so moiss
Bang bang, bang bang, House Gang, chainsaw
Here to kill you pussies, don't ask what we came for
I write until my right arm veins sore
Forearm feel like Thor's arm in a gang war
You hear that? Yaowa, you know who finna fall out
Definitively finish you, my fist take out that eyeball
Piranha mentality with a Jaws bite all night
Coming up, never saw light, but never lost sight

Jets and movers, cesspoolers, meth abusers
You step to us, text Rugers to respect the shooters
My men think in sync, roll with the best crew
Move to the beat of the same drum without Lex Luger
Welcome to Nayhood, big in the 'jects, G
Cheated death multiple times without rigging the deck
So I'm well-prepped if you just want war
There will be blood everywhere, you be laying on the Louboutin floor
It's raw, you keeping acting like you don't know Mouse, nigga
And you going to need the best doctors, house nigga
Guard your jewels and avoid large tools
Cause after I spill you at the light, you be in a car pool
Keep your distance from idiots, cause the truth told
They food for thought's rotten, they gems are fool's gold
Need results from my actions, mistakes I'll exonerate
I'm Martin King staring at a picture of Obama's face
Talking funds, niggas ain't never seen stock
I don't need the key to the game, I pick a mean lock


Take off, you invited inside of the mind of
A psychotic rhymer, I'm kind of a (Dahmer)
I'm grinding up rappers are lining up jackers, I'm climbing up ladders
I buy enough clappers to retire you factors, fire at drama
You liars and actors, I'm the genuine article
But read me wrong, get my gun and split you to particles
(The gold hand) Tell me when and I'm there
Not only heir to the throne, but my chair is suspended in air
Stay fly like unlimited fare
You got us pegged wrong, my circle don't fit in with squares
I smell shit and piss, know where it's coming from
You stepped on number two just to be number one
Now I'm a step on you, bring it to your yard
Bogart for arts, we go hard
You frauds just blow hard like broads, I coast guard the West
I'm Mozart, I compose dark shit with no heart

I got Jim Beam in the liver, getting head like clean clippers
With haters on my dick like a jeans zipper
When I throw up 16's like I drink liquor
You think you seen sick? Well, bitch, you ain't seen sicker
Than a cracker that will hop around in a hospital gown
Popping the trunk, my pump will stay cocking the round
I shit logs and I piss river brown
Cause I drink creek water and spit the river Nile
And that's as close as I get to a pyramid
Shit, they think I'm Illuminati, so fucking ignorant
Sick with a grin, here with this pen, so innocent
But when you win, they say you a sin, but in the end
They jump on the bandwagon and dance to the band playing
Skinny-ass pants sagging, it's only yourself you playing
Call me a clown, but you love what the clown's sanging
I'm a freak shows at the county carnival, then you paying
Bitch, I'm on a trapeze with no legs in the dark
Yelling "Go Shady!" Driving slower than an old lady
In an old '89, no piece if you pay me
Give me peace sign on my grill, no Mercedes
I'm getting paid for these shows that I throw lately
Same shows a year ago would have broken most of you crazies
They call me crazy cause I made it
Bitch, you crazy cause you quit, look at my clique lately
You ain't fucking with Budden, you ain't got no choice with Royce
You don't want to see the Crooked I, well, listen to Ortiz voice
That dirt road hit the 8 Mile, the point oh boys
And if Marshall want me to clap, then, homie, I deploy game over
Yo, I don't think they heard you, tell 'em again
Game over![Produced by DJ Khalil & Danny Keyz]

Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life

I don't think she understands the sacrifices that I've made
Maybe if this bitch had acted right I woulda stayed
But I've already wasted over half my life
I woulda laid down and died for you, I no longer cry for you
No more pain, bitch, you took me for granted, took my heart and ran it
Straight into the planet, into the dirt, I can no longer stand it
Now my respect I demand it: I'mma take control of this relationship
Command it, and I'mma be the boss of you now, goddammit
And what I mean is that I will no longer let you control me
So you better hear me out, this much you owe me
I gave up my life for you, totally devoted to you I have stayed
Faithful all the way, this is how I fucking get repaid?
Look at how I dress: fucking baggy sweats, go to work a mess
Always in a rush to get back to you, I ain't heard you yet
Not even once say you appreciate me, I deserve respect
I've done my best to give you nothing less than perfectness
And I know that if I end this I'll no longer have nothing left
But you keep treating me like a staircase, it's time to fucking step
And I won't be coming back, so don't hold your fucking breath
You know what you've done, no need to go in depth
I told you you'd be sorry if I fucking left, I laughed while you wept
How's it feel now, yeah, funny, ain't it? You neglected me
Did me a favor, though, my spirit free you've set
But a special place for you in my heart I have kept, it's unfortunate but it's


I feel like when I bend over backwards for you all you do is laugh
Cause that ain't good enough, you expect me to fold myself in half
'til I snap, don't think I'm loyal, all I do is rap
How can I moonlight on the side, I have no life outside of that
Don't I give you enough of my time, you don't think so, do you
Jealous when I spend time with the girls, why I'm married to you still, man
I don't know, but tonight I'm serving you with papers
I'm divorcing you: go marry someone else and make 'em famous
And take away their freedom like you did to me
Treat 'em like you don't need 'em and they ain't worthy of you
Feed 'em the same shit that you made me eat, I'm moving on, forget you
Oh, now I'm special? I ain't feel special when I was with you
All I ever felt was this helplessness, imprisoned by a selfish bitch
Chew me up and spit me out, I fell for this so many times it's ridiculous
And still I stick with this, I'm sick of this
But in my sickness and addiction, you're addictive as they get
Evil as they come, vindictive as they make 'em
My friends keep asking me why I can't just walk away from
I'm addicted to the pain, the stress, the drama, I'm drawn to shit
I guess I'm a mess, cursed and blessed
But this time I ain't changing my mind, I'm climbing out this abyss
You're screaming as I walk out that I'll be missed
But when you spoke of people who meant the most to you, you left me off your list
Fuck you, hip hop, I'm leaving you, my life sentence is served, bitch and it's just...

Now what you know about a sweet MC, from the 313
None of these skills you bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you gotta become me
If you ever wanna be one see

Yo some people say I'm whack, now if that's right
I'm the freshest whack MC that you ever heard, in your lifetime
My slick acapella sounds clever with the beats
Boy I'm the deepest thing since potholes to ever hit the streets
Forget a gold digger's succubus; my souls thick with ruggedness
With the mic I'm like a dyke, can't no nigga fuck with this
I got more Different Strokes than Philip Drummound
On open mic I bone your women just to keep my lyrics coming
We elevated to new heights premeditated
Let it be that I stated they hate it now that they see that I made it
The escalated can be put to the test of greatness
Snatch the heart from MC's and I ate it
So I take it that's the reason I'm hated
To represent's my temperament
If rap was a dick all you so called hard MC's would not be impotent
But pimping it, and acting like you could rock a show
Harder than LL's Rock the Bells, but you is a ho
Everything that you collaborate I lacerate
My rhymes they keep coming like nymphomaniacs that masturbate
At a faster rate, yeah I got something for your ass to hate
I blast your hate, and have you all running master gates
And as for face clutching and touching the flows
I got them open like marijuana smoke up in your nose
Buckin' these hoes, I got that shit down to a science
Leavin' them hot and bothered, turned on like an appliance
Defiance, no we won't have that
You want your shit to blow up
Well I'mma stuff some dynamite in your ass crack
And blast that shit to kingdom come
Then bring them some of this real hip-hop
I drop beats and you ain't singing or gonna do a thing about
And you all knew from Meeko
That you couldn't hold your own with the strength of Lou Ferrigno
So stop that bullshit and flow
Yo, you need to come with the real skills, and act like you know


So what, you know about a sweet MC, in the 313
You don't know shit so when you see one flee
You can be Run-D, you'll never be the MC
I'll stop the alphabet at S and got it down to a T
I'm sure your bound to agree, a sweet MC crashes the spot
I'll make the roof hot like I was Rock Master Scott
Your ass forgot, so just in case you don't remember me
I'll run your brain around the block to jog your fucking memory
It's either them or me man, kill or be killed
You will will be sealed your casket closed you still will be billed
My facilities filled with fans, packed to capacity
I'll send a rapper back with the crack of his ass shitty
If he's acting soft and he cowers
He better come cleaner then Jeru jackin' off when he showers
You flowers got no clout with a thing
You could date a stick of dynamite and wouldn't go out with a bang
I shout with a slang, simple as A,B,C's
Skip over the D's and rock the microphone with ease
Dethrone MC's and I'mma max alone
Relax your dome like a solo from a saxophone
So facts are known, writers get treated with shocks
I rock a beat harder than you could beat it with rocks
I'm greeted with flocks, of fellow followers' singers
You couldn't make the fans throw up their hands
If they swallowed their fingers
But you can bring yours let's see what you got
But don't front and never try to be what you're not
Cause you can be quick, jump the candlestick, burn your back
And fuck Jill on a hill, but you still ain't Jack

Yo, I'm trying to be the man of the day, three-six-five a year
See the bullshit you saying, Skam ain't trying to hear (Fuck that!)
Busting lyrics in the air, keeping some up in the chamber
(Yo Skam, what the fuck you doing?) Man, I'm releasing anger!
(I'm trying to be the illest of the day, three six five a year
See that bullshit you saying, Shady ain't trying to hear
Spitting lyrics in your ear, keeping some up in the chamber)
Aiyyo Shady what the fuck you doing? (I'm releasing anger!)

Man I'm tired of being tired, every time I wake up
Tired of these fake ducks, tired of being late for the bus
Tired of all be blending, and ending up dating sluts
So my facial expression stay stuck up, and shut the fuck up!
To the pity ass rappers, that ain't shit with out make-up, wake up
Gold digging bitches, the buck stops here
The road to riches is closed for repair
So if the shoe ain't fitting, girl leave that shit alone
You ain't Erykah Badu, what I look like Tyrone?
I rip your tissue out your ear, spitting like I don't care
My hair look like I ain't comb it, shit a damn near year
So I burn, zig-zag, I leave the next man with his heels up
Brain dead, and be reincarnated at a speed bump
When we done we stay hard, so you don't land shit
Suck Skam's dick, off of what a dead man spit
Yo that's it, I don't plan shit, you know how we go down
They need to slow down, and take a look who the ho now
At every industry party, getting so damn drunk
Can't remember the lass ass you kissed, or dick you sucked
Remind me of my ex, in the street got me veck
Trying to roll up on Miami, leaving with a broke neck
Oh shit, lethal lyric equal land mind
I be stacking up white rappers like I'm throwing gas signs
And I'm, buck wild exposing the plain truth
You couldn't mess with me, fucking shit up in the same room
Hey you, I don't know you but fuck it, let me get a dollar
For this bad car, that go along with the breath
Some show the mad bomb, and steal the show like a theft
Cause in Miami, the baby jamming like three up in the chamber
(Yo Skam what the fuck you doing?)


"I just wanna figure something in my head
And maybe you can help me out here
When a person is insane, as you clearly are
Do you know that you're insane?
And you're just sitting around reading Guns & Ammo
Masturbating in your own feces
Do you just stop and go
"Wow, it's just amazing how fucking crazy I really am"?"

Some people say I'm strange, I tell them ain't shit change
I'm still the same lame asshole with a different name
Came late to the last show with a different dame
Brain ate from the last O' that I sniffed of 'caine
You know you're spaced the fuck out like George Lucas
When your puke is turning to yellowish-orange mucus
So when I grab a pencil and squeeze it between fingers
I'm not a rapper, I'm a demon who speaks English
Freak genius, too extreme for the weak and squeamish
Burn you alive till you screaming to be extinguished
Cause when I drop the science, motherfuckers tell me to stop the violence
Start a fire and block the hydrants
I'm just a mean person, you never seen worse than
So when Slim gets this M-16 bursting
You getting spun backwards like every word of obscene cursing
On the B-side of my first single with the clean version
Stopping your short life while you're still a teen virgin
Unless you get a kidney specialist and a spleen surgeon
In the best hospital possible for emergency surgery
To try to stop the blood from your ruptured sternum internally
I'll take it back before we knew each other's name
Run in a ultrasound and snatch you out your mother's frame
I'll take it further back than that
Back to Lovers' lane, to the night you were thought of, and
Cock block your father's game
I'll plead the fifth like my jaws were muzzled
So suck my dick while I take a shit and do this crossword puzzle
And when I'm down with ten seconds left in the whole bout
I'mma throw a head-butt so hard, I'll knock us both out

There is no escaping, there's no place to hide
You scream someone save me, but they don't pay no mind
Goodnight, goodbye

You're walking down a horror corridor
It's almost four in the morning and you're in a, nightmare it's horrible
Right there's the coroner, waiting for ya
To turn the corner so he can corner ya, you're a goner, he's onto ya
Out the corner of his cornea, he just saw ya run
All ya want is to rest cause you can't run anymore, you're done
All he wants is to kill you in front of an audience
While everybody is watching in the party, applauding it
Here I sit while I'm caught up in deep thought again
Contemplating my next plot again, swallowing a Klonopin
While I'm noddin' in and out on the ottoman
At the Ramada Inn, holding onto the pill bottle, then
Lick my finger and swirl it round the bottom and
Make sure I got all of it, wake up naked at McDonald's with
Blood all over me, dead bodies behind the counter, shit
Guess I must'a just blacked out again, not again

It's 3 a.m. in the morning, put my key in the door
Bodies laying all over the floor and
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must'a killed 'em, killed 'em

Sitting nude in my living room, it's almost noon
I wonder what's on the tube, maybe they'll show some boobs
Surfing every channel until I find Hannah Montana
Then I reach for the aloe and Lanolin
Bust all over the wall panelin'
Dismantlin' every candle on top of the fireplace mantle and
Grab my flannel and my bandana then kiss the naked mannequin man again
You can see him standin' in my front window if you look in
I'm just a hooligan who's used to using hallucinogens
Causing illusions again, brain contusions again
Cutting and bruising the skin, razors, scissors and pins
Jesus, when does it end?
Phases that I go through, dazed and I'm so confused
Days that I don't know who gave these molecules to
Me, what am I gon' do? Hey, the prodigal son
The diabolical one, very methodical when I slaughter them


She puts the lotion in the bucket
It puts the lotion on the skin
Or else it gets the hose again

I cut and I slash, slice and gash
Last night was a blast, I can't quite remember when I had that
Much fun off a half pint of the Jack
My last Vic and a half, a fleshlight of Kim Kardashian's ass
I remember the first time I dismembered a family member
December, I think it was: I was having drinks with my cousin
I wrapped him in Christmas lights, pushed him into the stinkin' tub
Cut him up into pieces and just when I went to drink his blood
I thought I oughta drink his bath water, that oughta be fun
That's when my days of serial murder manslaughter begun
The sight of blood excites me; that might be an artery, son
Your bloodcurdling screams just don't seem to bother me none
It's 3 a.m. and here I come, so you should probably run
A secret passageway around here, man, there's gotta be one
Oh no, there's probably none, he can scream all that he wants
Top of his lungs, but ain't no stopping me from chopping him up-up


Evil... Rise (X8)[Verse 1]
I'm the illest rapper to hold a cordless, patrolling corners
Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
I'm meaner in action than Roscoe beating James Todd, Sr
And smackin' his back with vacuum cleaner attachments
I grew up in the wild hood as a hazardous youth
With a fucked up childhood that I used as an excuse
And ain't shit changed but kept the same mindstate
Since the third time that I failed 9th grade
You probably think that I'm a negative person don't be so sure of it
I don't promote violence I just encourage it
I laugh at the sight of death as I fall down a cement flight of steps
And land inside a bed of spider webs
So throw caution to the wind, you and a friend
Can jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again
Shit, why not? Blow your brain out, I'm blowing mine out
Fuck it, you only live once you might as well die now

It's only fair to warn, I was born with a set of horns
And metaphors attached to my damn umbilical cord
Warlord of rap that'll bash you with a 2 by 4 board
And smash into your Honda Accord with a 4 door Ford
But I'm more towards droppin an acappella that'll chop a fella
To Mozzarella, worse than a helicopter propeller
Got you locked in the cellar with your skeleton showing
Developing anorexia while I'm standing next to ya
Eating a full course meal watching you starve to death
With an IV in your veins feeding you liquid darvicet
Pumping you full of drugs, pull the plugs
On the gunshot victims full of bullet slugs
Who were picked up in an ambulance and driven
To receiving with the asses ripped out of they pants and given
A less than 20 percent chance of living
Have a possible placement, it's a hospital patient
Storing the dead bodies in grandma's little basement
Doctor Kevorkian has arrived
To perform an autopsy on you while you scream "I'M STILL ALIVE!"
Driving a rusty scalpel in through the top of your scalp
And pulling your Adam's apple out through your mouth
Better call the fire department, I've hired an arson
To set fire to carpets and burn up your entire apartment
I'm a liar to start shit
Got your bitch wrapped around my dick
So tight, you need a crobar to pry her apart with

Met a retarded kid named Greg with a wooden leg
Snatched it off and beat him over the fucking head with the peg
Go to bed with the keg, wake up with the 40
Mix it with Alka Seltzer and Formula 44D
Fuck an acid tab, I'll strap the whole sheet to my forehead
Wait until it absorbed in and fell to the floor dead
No more said, case closed, end of discussion
I'm blowing up like spontaneous human combustion
Leaving you in the aftermath of holocaust and traumas
Cross the bombers? We blowing up your house killing your parents
And coming back to get your foster mommas
And I'm as good at keeping a promise as Nostradamus
Cause I ain't making no more threats
I'm doing drive-bys in tinted Corvettes on Vietnam war vets
I'm more or less sick in the head
Maybe more cause I smoked crack today, yesterday and the day before
Saboteur, walk the block with a labrador
Strapped with more corral for war than El Salvador
Foul style galore, verbal cow manure
Coming together like an eyebrow on Al B. Sure![Verse 1]
(Aight, aight...Uh...Slim Shady...Yo, yo, yo...)
It's only fair to warn, I was born with a set of horns
And metaphors attached to my damn umbilical cord
Warlord of rap that'll bash you with a two by four board
And smash into your Honda Accord with a 4-door Ford
But I'm more toward droppin' an acapella
To chop a fella into mozzarella worse than a helicopter propeller
Got you locked in the cellar with your skeleton showing
Developing anorexia while I'm standin' next to ya
Eating a four course meal, watching you starve to death
With an IV in your veins, feeding you liquid Darvocet
Pumping you full of drugs
Pull the plugs
On the gunshot victims full of bullet slugs
Who were picked up in an ambulance
And driven
To receiving with the asses ripped outta they pants
And given
A less than 20 percent chance
Of living
Have a possible placement
As a hospital patient
Storing the dead bodies in grandma's little basement
Doctor Kevorkian has arrived
To perform an autopsy on you while you scream "I'M STILL ALIVE!"
Driving a rusty scalpel in through the top of your scalp, and
Pullin' your Adam's apple out through your mouth
Better call the fire department
I've hired a arson
To set fire to carpet
And burn up your entire apartment
I'm a liar to start shit
Got your bitch wrapped around my dick
So tight you need a crowbar to pry her apart with
Motherfucker, Slim Shady bitch! Recognize!

Met a retarded kid named Greg, with a wooden leg
Snatched it off and beat him over the fucking head with the peg

Motherfucker!

(Like this, like that, like this
Like this, like that, like this)
I'm the illest rapper to hold a cordless, patrolling corners
Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
I'm meaner in action than Roscoe beating James Todd Sr
And smackin' his back with vacuum cleaner attachments
I grew up in a wild hood
As a hazardous youth
With a fucked up childhood
That I used as an excuse
And ain't shit changed
I kept the same mindstate
Since the third time that I failed 9th grade
You probably think that I'm a negative person, don't be so sure of it
I don't promote violence, I just encourage it
I laugh at the sight of death
As I fall down a cement flight of steps
And land inside a bed of spider webs
So throw caution to the wind
You and a friend
Can jump off of a bridge, and if you live, do it again
Shit, why not? Blow your brain out
I'm blowing mine out
Fuck it, you only live once, you might as well die now

Yo, yo, yo!
My mom sent up to the store with a food stamp
For a pack of cigarettes and a book at the news stand (here)
Two dudes ran up and jumped out of a blue van
I looked down at the ground and picked up a huge branch
I swung it at the first dude, the other one with him
Seen it snap so fast, it looked like it broke before it hit him
So he tried to rush, I swept his legs, pinned him, and bit him
He came back with 6 or 7 dudes screaming "GET HIM!"
I grabbed one,  lit him on fire, pinned, and bit him
The next faggot gave me his shoes like they didn't fit him
One by one I just kept dropin' 'em in a rhythm
Then I woke up swingin' the middle of the kitchen

(Damn... damn... damn...)Verse 1:
You probably gonna think that I'm talking
About you and you goddamn right I am
Look at you, this is the minimal I could diss you
Subliminally, but I think criminal instinct
Has pushed me to the brink, my pussy does it stink
He still loves me cause he puts me in his ink
He does, doesn't he, still is, isn't he?
Nah, I'm just playing tug of war with his heart cause he misses me
I can still fuck him and leave him whenever I feel frisky
And is no risk of disease cause he ain't with anyone is he?
This bitch really thinks she can get me
If she still wants me, driving across country
Strapped up to the front seat, missing all her front teeth
Thinking to herself when's the next time he's gonna punch me?
I told this cunt she's gonna over-do it once
And once she does, she was stuffed up in a trunk
Crunch, he scrunched her up in a ball
Bunched up nice and comfy
Fuck around get dumped up in a lake 'fore you dump me
You cunning little cunt, deceitful witch
You thought you had me, 'till my shrink told me this

Hook:
The problem is all inside your head she said to me
The answer is easy if you take it logically
I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free
There must be 50 ways to leave your lover

Verse 2:
I feel like a serial killer I keep dumping bodies in the lake
I'mma get caught and send up the river I shiver
When I think of the company I keep
How do I know she ain't gonna kill me when I sleep
I shriek, every time she hands me something to drink
Sex kept us together, when we slept together every-thing
Was all better, she made me feel like a king
Slowly, she began lowering my self-esteem
She go to the club and not answer the phone when I call her
And I just bought her a truck for 50,000 dollars
Accused me of doing drugs and scream 'n holla"
Then I find a bag of coke on her, some marijuana
And all I know is every time I go
To them hiding spots, wherever she hides her blow
The little bags of dope, there was a pile of coke
That's growing smaller, and that was just a while ago
And I wouldn't even let on like I know
What was I supposed to do, call her out on it, we just argue
Say she put it there on purpose and flipped the whole script
Ooh she's a manipulative evil bitch
A cunning little cunt, little deceitful witch
She thought she had me, 'till my shrink told me this

Hook:
The problem is all inside your head she said to me
The answer is easy if you take it logically
I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free
There must be 50 ways to leave your lover[Eminem]
Sometimes I just feel like, quittin' I still might
Why do I put up this fight, why do I still write
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin' with real life
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
And show these people what my level of skill's like
But I'm still white, sometimes I just hate life
Somethin ain't right, hit the brake lights
Case of the stage fright, drawin a blank like
Da-duh-duh-da-da, it ain't my fault
Great big eyeballs, my insides crawl
And I clam up {*wham*} I just slam shut
I just can't do it, my whole manhood's
Just been stripped, I have just been vicked
So I must then get, off the bus then split
Man fuck this shit; yo, I'm goin' the fuck home
World on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Road

I'm a man, I'mma make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up, and travel new land
Time to really just take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks man I'mma never look back
(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin
Sorry momma I'm grown, I must travel alone
Ain't gon' follow the footsteps I'm makin' my own
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road

I'm walkin' these train tracks, tryin' to regain back
The spirit I had 'fore I go back to the same crap
To the same plant, in the same pants
Tryin' to chase rap, gotta move ASAP
And get a new plan, momma's got a new man
Poor little baby sister, she don't understand
Sits in front of the TV, buries her nose in the pad
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
While she colors her big brother and mother and dad
Ain't no tellin' what really goes on in her little head
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep runnin' from somethin' I never wanted so bad!
Sometimes I get upset, cause I ain't blew up yet
It's like I grew up, but I ain't grow me two nuts yet
Don't gotta rep my step, don't got enough pep
The pressure's too much man, I'm just tryin' to do what's best
And I try, sit alone and I cry
Yo I won't tell no lie, not a moment goes by
That I don't pray to the sky, please I'm beggin' you God
Please don't let me be pigeonholed in no regular job
Yo I hope you can hear me homey wherever you are
Yo I'm tellin' you dawg I'm bailin' this trailer tomorrow
Tell my mother I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye
Say whenever you need me baby, I'm never too far
But yo I gotta get out there, the only way I know
And I'mma be back for you, the second that I blow
On everything I own, I'll make it on my own
Off to work I go, back to this 8 Mile Road


You gotta live it to feel it, you didn't you wouldn't get it
Or see what the big deal is, why it was and it still is
To be walkin this borderline of Detroit city limits
It's different, it's a certain significance, a certificate
Of authenticity, you'd never even see
But it's everything to me, it's my credibility
You never seen heard smelled or met a real MC
Who's incredible upon the same pedestal as me
But yet I'm still unsigned, havin' a rough time
Sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes
Go to work and serve MCs in the lunchline
But when it comes crunch time, where do my punchlines go?
Who must I show, to bust my flow?
Where must I go? Who must I know?
Or am I just another crab in the bucket?
Cause I ain't havin' no luck with this little Rabbit so fuck it
Maybe I need a new outlet, I'm startin to doubt shit
I'm feelin' a little skeptical who I hang out with
I look like a bum, yo my clothes ain't about shit
At the Salvation Army tryin to salvage an outfit
And it's cold, tryin' to travel this road
Plus I feel like I'm on stuck in this battlin mode
My defenses are so up, but one thing I don't want
Is pity from no one, the city is no fun
There is no sun, and it's so dark
Sometimes I feel like I'm just bein' pulled apart
From each one of my limbs, by each one of my friends
It's enough to just make me wanna jump out of my skin
Sometimes I feel like a robot, sometimes I just know not
What I'm doin I just blow, my head is a stove top
I just explode, the kettle gets so hot
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the ass that I don't got
But I've learned, it's time for me to U-turn
Yo it only takes one time for me to get burned
Ain't no fallin' no next time I meet a new girl
I can no longer play stupid or be immature
I got every ingredient, all I need is the courage
Like I already got the beat, all I need is the words
Got the urge, suddenly it's a surge
Suddenly a new burst of energy has occurred
Time to show these free world leaders the 3 and a third
I am no longer scared now, I'm free as a bird
Then I turn and cross over the median curb
Hit the 'burbs and all you see is a blur from 8 Mile Road


Your style is generic
Mines authentic made
I roll like a renegade
You need clinic aid
My technique is bizarre and ill;
I scar and kill
You were a star until I served you like a bar and grill
As I proceed to cook and grill ya
That’s all that took to kill ya
You better recognize me like I look familiar
You want to battle
You beat around the bush
Like you're scared to lick pussy so you eat around the tush
I need a clown to push
Someone that I can bully
Wait a minute I don’t think you understand fully
See me without a style
Is like mustard without the Hienz’s
I lead the new school
You a BUSTA without the RHYMES

Now, everybody from the 313
Put your motherfucking hands up and follow me
Everybody from the 313, put your motherfucking hands up
Look, look

Now, while he stands tough
Notice that this man did not have his hands up
This Free World's got you gassed up
Now, who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf
1, 2, 3, and to the 4
1 Pac, 2 Pac, 3 Pac, 4
4 Pac, 3 Pac, 2 Pac, 1
You're Pac, he's Pac, no Pac, none
This guy ain't no motherfucking MC
I know everything he's 'bout to say against me
I am white, I am a fucking bum
I do live in a trailer with my mom
My boy Future is an Uncle Tom
I do got a dumb friend named Cheddar Bob
Who shoots himself in his leg with his own gun
I did get jumped by all six of you chumps
And Wink did fuck my girl
I'm still standing here screaming, fuck the Free World
Don't ever try to judge me, dude
You don't know what the fuck I've been through
But I know something about you
You went to Cranbrook, that's a private school
What's the matter, dog, you embarrassed?
This guy's a gangster? His real name's Clarence
And Clarence lives at home with both parents
And Clarence parents have a real good marriage
This guy don't wanna battle, he shook
Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
He's scared to death, he's scared to look in his fucking yearbook
Fuck Cranbrook

Fuck the beat, I'll go a capella
Fuck a Papa Doc, fuck a clock, fuck a trailer, fuck everybody
Fuck y'all if you doubt me
I'm a piece of fucking white trash, I say it proudly
And fuck this battle, I don't wanna win, I'm outtie
Here, tell these people something they don't know about me[Verse 1: Eminem]

I know this girl
And her name is Lily
And its past her bed
T-I-M-E
She goes to sleep
And she can just dream
And not have to be
In a stinky trailer wit me
So when i feel blue
And dont know what to do
I look at you
And i just say... *Rasberry Noise*It's okay, it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway

Sometimes I just feel like, quitting I still might
Why do I put up this fight, why do I still write
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin' wit real life
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics

And show these people what my level of skills like
But I'm still white, sometimes I just hate life
Something ain't right, hit the brake lights
Case of the stage fright, drawin' a blank like

Uh, da di da , it ain't my fault
Great big eyeballs, my insides crawl
And I clam up, I just slam shut
I just can't do it, my whole manhood's

Just been stripped, I have just been ripped
So I must then get, off this bus then split
Man fuck this shit yo, I'm going the fuck home
World on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 mile road

I'm a man, I'ma make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up, and travel new land
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks man I'ma never look back

8 mile road, and I'm gone, I know right where I'm going

Ain't following no footsteps, I'm making my own

It's like I grew up, but I ain't grow me two nuts yet
Don't got a rep my step, don't got enough pep
The pressures too much man, I'm just tryin' to do what's best

And I try, sit alone and I cry
Yo I won't tell no lie, not a moment goes by
That I don't pray to the sky, please I'm beggin' You, God

Wahoo, guess who's back?
Mommy, we're home
Say hello to my little friends
DJ Muggs, Soul Assassins, Cypress Hill
Everybody, put your hands where my eyes can see

Verse 1 - Eminem
Everywhere we go people know that we roll deep as fuck
Fourty fifty Samoans, they knowing when D-Bo was 50
Tweezy, Obie there won't be no hoe in us
They pop shit like they gon do shit but no one does
From New York down to Texas, back up to Los Angeles
We've changed the way we move so man up if you can't adjust
You may end up getting rushed by too many to handle us
It's funny, I guess money does have its advantages
And it isn't that we just think that we can't be touched
It's not like we're just feeling ourselves that much
It's just, that if someone ever does put us in the clutch
We just know that y'all ain't gon be the one who's gon do it
Cause first of all you're pussy and everybody can see that
You fuck around, get caught in a spot that you shouldn't be at
That you got no business being in, we ain't even gon be in it
No one's gunna hear nothing, no one's gunna see this shit
And they'll be in and up out of it, them boys is bout it, bout it
The noise from [unverified] be drowned out by the crowd
And you'll be laying on the ground getting trampled by people dancing
Till the club closes and clears out
And that's when they see you flatened
Nobody saw it happen, all cause your jaws are flapping
And you couldn't stop yapping and took it past rapping
It ain't about the music no more, it's 'bout trying to show off
And it feels like any minute the bomb is 'bout to go off

Hook - Eminem
Shit's about to change, cause we ain't playing no games
We ain't budging neither are they, we ain't saying no names
Shit just ain't the same, when the AK's gettin' sprayed
Cause hip hop is in a state of 911

It ain't about hip hop, cause those days are gone
It ain't about trying rip shots, to get props no more
It's about trying not to get popped and get dropped to the floor
Cause hip hop is in a state of 911

Verse 2 - Cypress Hill
Step off my holster cause shit is getting serious
All theses drugs you be fucking with make you delirious
Thinking you coming with heat, yo son, I'm curious
How long are you gunna hate us and judge us and jury us?
Some people can never fade us, that make us so furious
Mistake us for fakers, homie we great and glorious
We living for real and others just making the stories up
Allusions are broken, so live it up, you corny fucks
If you take a fucking minute to think about what you've done
When you stood against a gangsta who live and die by the gun
Got a hot one, spraying you bitches till there is none
I'm like a rolling stone homie, I got you under my thumb
Silly little bitches can end up right up in ditches
We cut you and give you stitches, for envy all my riches
Your game's just like a midget, you're clocking a small digit
Dealing with the Giant Goliath, people that's how we live it, c'mon

Hook - Eminem
Shit's about to change, cause we ain't playing no games
We ain't budging neither are they, we ain't saying no names
Shit just ain't the same, when the AK's gettin' sprayed
Cause hip hop is in a state of 911

It ain't about hip hop, cause those days are gone
It ain't about trying rip shots, to get props no more
It's about trying not to get popped and get dropped to the floor
Cause hip hop is in a state of 911

Verse 3 - Soul Assassins
Uh, gangsta gangsta who come to pay you a visit
On this shit you call hip hop, this function is where did it
When I put it in motion, my focus is getting branded
My appetite for destruction is blasted because I said it
Got you stumbling for cover, this music dying in numbers
But you wouldn't pause and wonder, admitting it's all glamor
When you enter the business you thinking you running shit
You witness that funny shit, your bitches they ain't shit
We gangsta's we blast first, ask questions later
All these imitators parading like they some playas
Trying to save hip hop the task is something greater
Cause we old fashioned coded with loyalty motivaters
Get caught, I'm not telling, or more like killing not caring
I'm riding a gangsta feeling, no fearing when gangstas dying
I'm in a full circle with homies that's supposed to bleed
On an 8 Mile mission with Cypress and O.G.'s

Hook - Eminem
Shit's about to change, cause we ain't playing no games
We ain't budging neither are they, we ain't saying no names

Some people can never fade us, that make us so furious
Mistake us for fakers, homie we greater and glorious
We living for real and others just making the stories up
Illusions are broken, so live it up, you corny fucks
If you take a fucking minute to think about what you've done
When you stood against a gangsta who live and die by the gun
Got a hot one, spraying you bitches til there is none
I'm like a rolling stone homie, I got you under my thumb
Silly little bitches can end up right up in ditches
We cut you and give you stitches, for envy and all my riches
Your game's just like a midget, you're clocking a small digit
Dealing with the Giant Goliath, people that's how we live it, c'mon


Verse 3: [Ganxsta Ridd]
Uh, gangsta Ganxsta who come to pay you a visit
On this shit you call hip-hop, this function is where did it
When I - put it in motion, my focus is getting branded
My appetite for destruction is blasted because I said it
Got you - stumbling for cover, this music dying in numbers
But you wouldn't pause and wonder, admitting it's all glamour
When you - enter the business you thinking you running shit
You witness that funny shit, your bitches they ain't shit!
We gangstas we blast first, ask questions later
All these - imitators parading like they some playas
Trying to - save hip-hop the task is something greater
Cause we old fashioned coded with loyalty motivaters
Get caught, I'm not telling, or more like killing not caring
I'm riding a - gangsta feeling, no fearing when gangstas dying
I'm in a - full circle with homies that's supposed to bleed
On an 8 Mile mission with Cypress and O.G.'s

'97 burgundy Blazer
Wanted for burglary
Had to ditch the Mercury Tracer
I'm on some Loc shit
Some fed up wit the 'being broke' shit
I'm not to joke with
Bitch, I don't sell crack
I smoke it
Having a coke fit and going through withdrawals daily
Shoot up with mescaline in front of my baby daughter Hailey
My brains dusted
I'm disgusted at all my habits
Too many aspirin tablets
Empty medicine cabinets
Losing battles to wack rappers because I'm always too blunted
Walking up in the cypher smoking
Talking about, "Who want it"
Thug and a crook
Every drug in the book
I've done it
My 9's at your brain
Is that your chain
Run it
Crews die from an overdosage of excessive flavour
Aggressive nature's got me sticking you for your progressive pager
Spectacular
Battle rap manufacturer
Stole your mama's Acura
Wrecked it and sold it back to her
Cruise in Nike jackets
Escaped from psychiatrics
Told the nurse to save my bed for me
"I might be back quick"
So barricade your entrance
Put up some extra fences
A woman beater
Wanted for repeated sex offences
Chasing dips
Take them on long vacation trips
Kidnapping them and trapping them in abusive relationships
Mess up your face and lips
Slit your stomach and watch your gut split
Got you with that razor that I use to shave my nuts with
Mama don't you cry
Your son's too far gone
I'm so high
I don't even know what label I'm on
I'm messed up
I feel just like an overworked plumber
I'm sick of the crap
What's Jack Kevorkian's phone number[Produced by Bass Brothers]

Baby, your da-da loves you
And I'mma always be here for you no matter what happens
You're all I got in this world
I would never give you up for nothin
Nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me
I love you

C'mon Hai-Hai, we going to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let da-da strap you in the car seat
Oh where's mama? She's taking a little nap in the trunk
Oh that smell? Da-da musta runned over a skunk
Now I know what you're thinking - it's kind of late to go swimming
But you know your mama, she's one of those type of women
That do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
Don't play with da-da's toy knife, honey, let go of it (no!)
And don't look so upset, why you acting bashful?
Don't you wanna help da-da build a sand castle? (yeah!)
And mama said she wants to show how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
It's just a little scratch - it don't hurt, her was eating
Dinner while you were sweeping and spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy isn't she? We'll let her wash off in the water
And me and you can pway by ourselves, can't we?

Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride!
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I!

See honey: there's a place called "heaven" and a place called "hell"
A place called "prison" and a place called "jail"
And da-da's probably on his way to all of em except one
Cause mama's got a new husband and a stepson
And you don't want a brother do ya? (Nahhh)
Maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better
I'll explain it to ya
But for now, we'll just say mama was real, real bad
She was being mean to dad and made him real, real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on time-out
Sit back in your chair honey, quit trying to climb out!
I told you it's okay HaiHai, wanna ba-ba?
Take a night-night? Nan-a-boo, goo-goo ga-ga?
Her make poo-poo ca-ca? Da-da change your didee
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water
'97 Bonnie and Clyde: me and my daughter

Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride!
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I!

Wake up, sweepyhead we're here, before we pway
We're gonna take mama for a wittle walk along the pier
Baby, don't cry honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sweepy to hear you screaming in her ear (ma-maa!)
That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry
Da-da made a nice bed for mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you wanna help da-da tie a rope around this rock? (yeah!)
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
Ready now, here we go, on the count of free
One, two, free, whee! (woosh!)
There goes mama, splashing in the water
No more fighting with dad, no more restraining order
No more step-da-da, no more new brother
Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell mama you wuv her (mommy!)
Now we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk
But first, just help dad with two more things out the trunk

Just me and you baby
Is all we need in this world
Just me and you
Your da-da will always be there for you
Your da-da's always gonna love you
Remember that: if you ever need me I will always be here for you
If you ever need anything, just ask
Da-da will be right there
Your da-da loves you
I love you, baby[Spoken: Sampled voice]
This shit makes no sense to me
What does it all mean?
I can almost taste it
I can almost see it

Can't stop now
This might be the last chance I get
To be famous

You dream of trading places, I have been changing faces
You cannot fill these shoes, there is too much to lose
Wake up behind these trenches, you run around defenseless
There is too much to lose, You cannot fill these shoes

I just want to be famous...but
Be careful what you wish for

I stuck my dick in this game like a rapist
They call me Slim Roethlisberger
I go berserker than a fed up post office worker
I murk her with a Mossberg
I'm pissed off get murdered
Like someone took a ketchup squirter
Squirted a frankfurter
For a gangster you sure did shit your pants
When you saw the chainsaw get to waving
Like a terrible towel
How thangs turn around
When his fangs come out
Get your brains blown out
That's what I call blowing your mind
When I come back
Like nut on your spine
I'm a thumb tack
That you slept on son
Now here I come screaming "Attack!"
Like I just stepped on one
Low on the totem til he showed 'em
Defiance, giant scrotum
He don't owe them bitches shit
His britches, he out grow'd em
He's so out cold he's knocked out at the South Pole
And nobody fucks with him
Rigor mortis and post mortem
He's dying of boredom
Take your best rhymes, record 'em
Then try to thwart him
He'll just take your punch lines and snort em
Shit stained drawers
You gon fuck with a guy who licks the blades of his chainsaws
While he dips 'em in P.F. Chang's sauce
Game's up, homie, hang it up like some crank calls
You think I'm backing down you must be out of your dang skulls


I'm back for revenge
I lost a battle that ain't happening again
I'm at your throat like strep
I step, strapped with a pen
Metaphors wrote on my hand
Some are just stored in my memory
Some I wrote on a napkin
I do what I have to to win
Pulling out all stops, any who touch a mic prior's
Not even Austin Powers, how the fuck are they Mike Myers?
And tell that psycho to pass the torch
To the wacko before I take a shit in his Jack-O-Lantern
And smash it on his porch
Now get off my dick
Dick's too short of a word for my dick
Get off my antidisestablishmentarianism, you prick
Don't call me the champ; call me the space shuttle destroyer
I just blew up the Challenger, matter fact I need a lawyer
I just laced my gloves with enough plaster to make a cast
Beat his ass naked and peed in his corner like Verne Troyer
Y'all are Eminem backwards, you're Mini Me's
See he's in a whole nother weight class
He's slugs; you're BBs, you're bean-bag bullets
You're full of it; you were dissing his CDs
Laughed at Infinite, now he's back like someone pissed in his Wheaties
No peace treaties, he's turned into a beast
His new Slim Shady EP's got the attention of the mighty D.R.E
He's almost famous


Now there he goes in Dre's studio cupping his balls
Screaming the wood off the paneling, cussing the paint off the walls
Spewing his hate to these haters, showing no love for these broads
He ain't given them shit, he says he'll pinch a penny so hard
He'll leave a bruise on the bronze so dark you can see the mark
With the scars, til Abraham Lincoln is screaming out AHH
These metaphors and similes ain't similar to them, not at all
If they don't like it, they can all get fucked instead of sucking him off
They can go get a belt or a neck tie, to hang themselves by
Like David Carradine they can go fuck themselves and just die
And eat shit while they at it
He's fucking had it, he's mad at the whole world
So go to hell and build a snowman, girl
The bullies become bullied, and pussies get pushed
Then they better pull me, take me back to 9th grade to school me
Cause I ain't looking back, only forward, this whole spot blowing
Who could've known he'd grow to be a poet and not know it
And while I'm being poetic let me get it stoic and raise the bar
Higher than my opinion of these women's been lowered
So bear witness to some biblical shit
There's a cold wind blowing, this world ain't gonna know what hit it
He did it, he made it, he's finally famous[Intro: Eminem]

Mentally ill from Amityville (he'll)
Accidentally kill your family still
Thinking he won't, goddammit he will (he's)
Mentally ill from Amityville (he's)

I get lifted and spin til I'm half-twisted
Feet planted and stand with a grin full of chapped lipstick (SMACK)
Pen full of ink, think sinful and rap sick shit
Shrink pencil me in for my last visit
Drink gin til my chin's full of splashed whiskers
Hash, whiskey, and ash til I slap bitches
Ask Bizzy he's been here the past six years
Mash with me again and imagine this

Mentally ill from Amityville (he'll)
Accidentally kill your family still
Thinking he won't, goddammit he will (he's)
Mentally ill from Amityville (he's)

I fucked my cousin in his asshole, slit my mother's throat
Guess who Slim Shady just signed to Interscope
My little sister's birthday, she'll remember me
For a gift I had ten of my boys take her virginity
And bitches know me as a horny-ass freak
Their mother wasn't raped, I ate her pussy while she was asleep
Pissy-drunk, throwing up in the urinal (you fucking homo)
That's what I said at my dad's funeral

Mentally ill from Amityville (he'll)
Accidentally kill your family still
Thinking he won't, goddammit he will (he's)
Mentally ill from Amityville (he's)

That's why the city is filled with a bunch of fucking idiots still
That's why the first motherfucker popping some shit he gets killed
That's why we don't call it Detroit, we call it Amityville
You can get capped after just having a cavity filled
Ahahahaha, that's why we're crowned the murder capital still
This ain't Detroit, this is motherfucking Hamburger Hill
We don't do drive-bys, we park in front of houses and shoot
And when the police come we fucking shoot it out with them too
That's the mentality here, that's the reality here
Did I just hear somebody say they want to challenge me here
While I'm holding a pistol with this many calibers here
Plus a registration that just made this shit valid this year
Cause once I snap, I can't be held accountable for my actions
And that's when accidents happen
When a thousand bullets come at your house
And collapse the foundation around and they found you
And your family in it
GOD DAMMIT HE MEANT IT WHEN HE TELLS YOU

Mentally ill from Amityville (he'll)
Accidentally kill your family still
Thinking he won't, goddammit he will (he's)
Mentally ill from Amityville (he's)

Alright, let's go
Yeah! Welcome to the official
Shade 45 Anger Management 3 Exclusive Mixtape (It's familiar!)
Brought to you by none other than the mother fuckin'
Notorious, infamous, DJ Clinton Sparks!
Whoo!

Once again it's the kid, yeah, eat a dick up
Pick up them nuts boy, lick up 'til you hiccup
Sick mo'fucka, yeah, same sick mug, it's the stick up
His middle finger and go chica-chica-chica
Hi! My name is Chica-chica-chica
Chica-chica-chica-chica-chica-chica-chica
Till this shit was stuck in your head
So much you were sick of I'mma teach love
In these boys say fuck a bitch say your daughter
And so we took this shit more
Choke a slut, smack a bitch whore
Beat a bitch up
Look at these kids they eat this shit up
And this was before I even knew what this shit was
It's affecting what it does
Parents come picking at us
Meanwhile ticket sales have just skyrocketed up
So shit fuck, shit fuck, shit fuck
Fuck you suck a dick slut
But I gotta go, it's time for me to go and pick up
Jessica, it's official I just broke her and Nick up[Produced by Mr. Walt of Da Beatminerz]

Hi!
Original Bad Boy on the case, cover your face
Came in the place blowed, and sprayed Puffy with Mase
I laced the weed with insect repellant, better check the smellin'
Eminem starts with E, better check the spelling
With a capital, somebody grab me a Snapple
I got an aspirin capsule trapped in my Adam's apple (hurry up!)
Somebody dropped me on my head, and I'm for sure
That my mother did it, but the bitch won't admit it was her
I slit her stomach open with a scalpel when she was six months
And said, "I'm ready now bitch - ain't you feelin these kicks cunt?"
The world ain't ready for me yet, I can tell
I'll probably have a cell next to the furnace in hell
I'm sicker than sperm cells with syphilis germs
And I'm hotter than my dick is, when I piss and it burns
I kick you in the tummy until you sick to your stomach
And vomit so much blood that your clothes stick to you from it (yuck!)
Hit you in the head with a brick til you plummet
If y'all don't like me, you can suck my dick til you numb it
And all that gibberish you was spittin, you need to kill it
Cause your style is like dying in my sleep, I don't feel it

Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
Is fuckin crazy -- you hear me? Ha?
Is fuckin crazy -- hello, hi!
Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
Is fuckin crazy -- do you hear me?
Is fuckin crazy

I'm ice grillin you, starin you down with a gremlin grin
I'm Eminem, you're a fag in a women's gym
I'm Slim, the Shady is really a fake alias
To save me with in case I get chased by space aliens
A brainiac, with a cranium packed, full of more uranium
Than a maniac Saudi Arabian
A highly combustible head, spazmatic
Strapped to a Craftmatic adjustable bed
Laid up in the hospital in critical condition
I flatlined; jumped up and ran from the mortician
High speed, IV full of Thai weed
Lookin Chinese, with my knees stuck together like Siamese
Twins, joined at the groin like lesbians
Uhh, pins and needles, hypodermic needles and pins
I hope God forgives me for my sins -- it probably all depends
On if I keep on killin my girlfriends


Last night I O.D.'d on rush, mushrooms and dust
And got rushed to the hospital to get my system flushed
(Shucks!) I'm an alcoholic and that's all I can say
I call in at work, cause all I do is frolic and play
I swallow grenades, and take about a bottle a day
Of Tylenol 3 and talk about how violent I'll be (RRARRRRH),
Give me eleven Excedrin my head'll spin
Medicine'll get me revvin like a 747 jet engine
Scratched my balls til I shredded skin
"Doctor, check this rash, look how red it's been"
"It's probably AIDS!" "Forget it then"
I strike a still pose and hit you with some ill flows
That don't even make sense, like dykes using dildos
So reach in your billfolds, for ten ducats
And pick up this Slim Shady shit that's on Rawkus
"Somethin somethin somethin, somethin, I get weeded"
My daughter scribbled over that rhyme, I couldn't read it
Damn!(dialing tone)

(Hello?)
Hi, this is Ariel?
(This is)
This is Marshall
(Listen, I'm in a serious-)
Don't hang up!
God... Are you gonna leave me too?
Ariel... Hi (What's up with you?)
I'm sorry, I'm s- (What’s your nationality?)
I'm sorry, uh-I'm a-I'm a white male
Single now, what should I do, Ariel?
Are you gonna leave me too?
Everybody's left me (If I'm gonna leave you?)
Yes (Tell me, what's up with you?)
I'm sorry, I-I, you know?
She comes in, from work late
(Your girlfriend?)
She comes in at late last night, okay?
I don't know where she's at
All I know is that she's got these little, like
Red marks on her neck
I'm like "Are those hickeys?"
"No, these aren't hickeys" I'm like
"You've been fooling around, I can't have it you"
She's done this to me before
I wish you could just, help me, like
I don't know, I'm-I'm kinda horny
(Huh? I'm listening) I've got candles lit
(What?) Candles, I've got candles, and got
The music playing, like a-- Can you hear it?
The music? (Why do you [?])
The mu-the music... oh, sorry (Just tell me why)
I don't know, I'm just horny
I need it-I don't know
I don't know if I need to just, like, jack off
Or like have sex with my girlfriend when she comes
I don't know anymore, you know? I'm just
(Relax) What? ([?] I think you're going crazy, 'kay?)
(Just take a bomb, okay, and go to sleep)
(And stop calling people and crying) A bomb?
(Uhuh) You want me to swallow a bomb, Ariel?
You want me to kill myself, right here, on national TV?!
(National TV? What's (stuttering and laughing)
I-I'm what? I don't understand, is that spanish or something?
I don't understand, what are you-
You know, I'm just an english regular guy, I'm a white kid, okay?
I grow up, you know
I don't know, oh my god... You know what?
If you're not gonna jack me off, you fucking slut
You can suck my dick, you fucking whore[Intro:]
Fucker
Yeah
Oh shit, it's the evil genius
Green lantern
Yeah
A yo Em
Ha ha
What we call this shit right here
The invasion
You have part one u got part two now its
Part three
The final chapter mother fuckers
Armageddon, lets go

I got a riddle what's little and talks big
With midget arms and creamy white fillin' in the middle
That will do anything to throw dirt on my name
If it means walkin' the whole Mediterranean
Is he an Albanian, Armenian, Iranian, Tasmanian no
His name's Raymond and oh, oh sorry yo so sorry whoah
But that was a long time ago when I was just Joe Shmoe
Rappin' in Joe Blows basement I apologized for it befo', so
Either except it or you don't and lets move on
If I've shown that I've grown and get the bone
Keep lickin' these nuts you industry mutts
Keep walkin' around sniffin' each others butts
Or should I say asses
What would be the more politically correct term to use for the masses

Hold up hold up hold up
New york city man
It's the kid Lloyd Banks
And if you hearin' what I'm hearin' right now
You know this ain't no regular shit homy
This something special and we gotta bring this back
Green come on
Countdown to

Armageddon
Lets go


The question I ask is
How can I explain this
How can I swing this in English language
If I switch to slang and turn mayn to mayn
Do I do it in vain or simply to entertain
Am I being real or am I being fake
Am I just a fraud or am I truly genuine
Or am I caught up in this hot water wody on my daughter
I told ya I love this culture don't let em' insult ya
I'm tell ya one more (a)gain this is the environment that I was brought up in
But every now and then I use my pen to get rid of some frustration
Or should I say or should I say shun
Is it just another one of my subliminal ways of racism
Your face is numb your stunned your look is cold
Like that of a man of seventy some years old
And it only gets colder which Is why I understand
And can't be mad at a forty four year old fan
With a chip on his shoulder who only owns a half of a magazine
And the only way to have it seen is to put me on the front of it again
Only thing that makes him grin is to see me frown
Papa can't stand me papa needs to take his medication and sit the fuck down
In his new chair that goes round and round
That he bought from new money in his bank account
That I get him every issue when the thang comes out
Sit back and let his puffy clown hair come out
And let his black side arm wrestle his white side
Yell Apartheid loud enough that he might slide
He might find someone dumb enough who might ride
But ain't nobody over here buyin' two white guys disguised as pro black
There is no slack
Far heart for college grad. In a fitted hat and a hunch back
Standin' by the clearance coat rack
In some old slacks and tomorrows old throw backs
Yeah

Shady in the place to be seen
And i got what it takes  to rock the mic right
Still not gonna cater these punks
Fuckin' cocksuckin' pussy lips haters dicks cunts[Verse 1]
Came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain
An asshole, that role think I succeeded fulfilling
But don't think I ever stopped to think that I was speaking to children
Everything was happening so fast, it was like I blinked – sold three million
Then it all went blank, all I remember is feelin' ridiculous cause I was getting sick of this feelin'
Like I am always under attack, man, I could have stacked my shit list to the ceiling
Women dishin' but really thinking if anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this I would kill him
Guess I'm a little bit of a hypocrite when I'm rippin' shit
But since when did this many
People ever give a shit what I had to say, it's just my opinion
If it contradicts how I'm living, put a dick in your rear end
That's why every time you mentioned a lyric, I thanked you for it
For drawing more attention toward it
Cause it gave me an enormous platform, I'm flattered you thought I was that important
But you can't ignore the fact that I fought for the respect and battle for it
Mad awards, had GLAAD annoyed atta-boy
They told me to slow down, and I just zone out
Good luck trying to convince a blonde, it's like telling Gwen Stefani that she sold out
Cause I was trying to leave, No Doubt
In anyone's mind one day I'd go down in history think they know now
Because everybody knows

Everybody knows that you're just an asshole
Everywhere that you go, people wanna go home, everyone knows
Everybody knows, so don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide
You are just an asshole
Everyone knows, everyone knows

Thanks for the support, asshole *scratch*
Thanks for the support, asshole

Quit actin' salty
I was countin' on you to count me out
Ask Asher Roth when he round about dissed me to shout me out
Thought I was history
But goddamn honky
That compliment's like backhanding a donkey
Good way to get your ass socked in the mouth
Nah, I'm off him
But what the fuck is all this trash talkin' about
The fight was fixed
I'm back and you can't stop me
You knocked me down, I went down for the count
I fell but the fans caught me and now
You're gonna have to beat the fuckin' pants off me to take my belt
Word to Pacquiao
Momma said there ain't nothing else to talk about
Better go in that ring and knock 'em out
Or you better not come out
It's poetry in motion
Like Freddie Roach when he's quotin' SHAKESpeare
So what if the insults are revolting
Even Helen Keller knows life stinks
You think it's a joke 'til you're bullet riddled
But you should give little shit what I think
This whole world is a mess
Gotta have a goddamn vest on your chest and a Glock just to go watch Batman
Who needs to test a testicles
Not that man
Half of you don't got the guts and intestinal blockage Rest of you got lap bands
Stuck to this motto before they put bath salts and all those water bottles in Colorado
So get lost, Waldo
My soul's escaping through this asshole that is gaping
A black hole and I'm swallowing this track whole Better pack toilet paper
But I'm taking no crap, ho
Here I go down the Bat Pole
And I'm changing back into that old maniac in fact there they go
Trying to dip out the back door retreating
Cause everybody knows

Everybody knows that you're just an asshole
Everywhere that you go, people wanna go home, everyone knows
Everybody knows, so don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide
You are just an asshole
Everyone knows, everyone knows

Holy mackerel
I'm the biggest jerk on the planet Earth
I smacked a girl off the mechanical bull at a tractor pull
For thinking we had some magnetic pull
Then screamed "ICP in this bitch!
How do fucking magnets work?"
Cause you're attractive, but we ain't attractable
Hate to be dramatical, but I'm not romantical
I'm making up words you can understandable
It's tragical
Thinkin' some magical shit's gonna happen
That ain't practical
You cracking a joke, it's laughable
Cause me and love's like a bad combination
I keep them feelings locked in a vault so it's safe to say I'm uncrackable
My heart is truly guarded
Full body armor
Bitch, you just need a helmet cause if you think you're special, you're retarded
Thinking you're one of a kind
Like you got some platinum vagina
You're a train wreck, I got a one-track mind
Shorty, you're fine but you sort of remind me of a 49er
Cause you been a gold digger since you was a miner
Been tryna hunt me down like a dog
Cause you're on my ass but you can't get a scent
Cause all of my spare time is spent
On my nose in this binder, so don't bother tryin'
Only women that I love are my daughters, but sometimes I rhyme
And it sounds like I forget I'm a father, and I push it farther, so Father forgive me if I forget to draw the line
It's apparent I shouldn't have been a parent, I'll never grow up, so to hell with your parents And 'mother' fucking 'father' time
It ain't never gonna stop, a pessimist who transformed to an optimist in his prime
So even if I'm half dead, I'm half alive
Poured my half empty glass in a cup, so now my cup has runneth over
And I'm bout to set it on you like a muthafucking coaster
I’m going back to what got me here, yeah cocky
And can’t knock being rude off, so fear not my dear
And dry up your teardrops I'm here
White America's mirror, so don't feel awkward or weird
If you stare at me and see yourself, because you're one too
Shouldn't be a shock, because everybody knows–[Hook]
The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
Doing, doing, doing
I don't believe it, it's almost too good to be true
I ain't never seen a ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
Doing doing doing

The way she moves, she's like a belly-dancer
She's shaking that ass to the new Nelly jams
I think someone's at the door but I don't think I'mma answer
Police saying 'freeze!': doing, doing, doing
What do you mean, 'freeze'? Please, I'm a human being!
I have needs! I'm NOT done, not 'til I'm finished peeing
I am not resisting arrest, I am agreeing
Mr. Officer! I'm already on my knees
I can't get on the ground any further, it's impossible for me
And do not treat me like a murderer, I just like to pee
Pee, pee, yes, I make R&B, I sing song
It go Ring-a-Chong, a-Ching-Chong-Chong-Chong-Ching
Psych! I joke, I joke! I keed, I keed!
If I offend, I'm sorry! Please, please, forgive!
For I am Triumph the Puppet Dog, I am a mere puppet
I can get away with anything I say and you will love it!

The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an - ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
Doing doing doing
Jessica Simpson looks oh so tempting
Nick, I ain't never seen a ass like that
Everytime I see that show on MTV, my pee-pee goes
Doing doing doing

Mary-Kate and Ashley used to be so wholesome
Now they getting older, they're starting to grow bum-bums
I go to the movies and sit down with my popcorn
Police saying 'freeze!': doing, doing, doing
What do you mean, 'freeze'? Geez, I just got my seat!
I have ticket, look, I put it away, my zipper's zipped!
Please do not remove me from this movie theatre, please
I did not even get to see Mary Kate's shower scene
I didn't mean to be obscene or make a great big scene
And don't treat me like I'm Pee Wee Herman, this movie's PG
Mr. Officer, I demand to see my attorney
I will simple plead innocent, cop a plea, and be free
Free, yes free, right back on the streets
What you mean my lawyer's with Michael, he's too busy?
I am Triumph, Britney Spears has shoulders like a man
And I can say that and you'll laugh
Cause there's a puppet on my hand

The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an - ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
Doing, doing, doing
Hilary Duff is not quite old enough, so
I ain't never seen her butt like that
Maybe next year, I'll say ass and she'll make my pee-pee go
Doing, doing, doing

The way she moves, she dances like a go-go
In that video, she sings, "Get out, you bozo
I need a new boyfriend!" Hi, my name is JoJo
Police saying 'freeze!': doing, doing, doing
What do you mean, 'freeze'? My computers will be seized
And my keys, to my ranch, I just bake cookies
Mr. Officer, lookie, take a whiff of this
Here, I make Jesus juice, take a sip of this
Nobody is safe from me! No, not even me
I don't even know if I can say the word 'pee-pee'
Pee, on the radio but I think I did
Janet, is that a breast? I think I just saw a tit!
Psych! I joke, I joke, I keed, I keed
I don't think my joke is working, I must flee quick!
Get to the chopper, everybody get out
I am not Triumph, I am Ah-nuld, get dowwwn!

The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an - ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
Doing, doing, doing
So Gwen Stefani, will you pee-pee on me please
I ain't never seen a - ass like that
Cause the way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
Doing, doing, doing

I don't know why this world keeps turning round and round
But I wish it would stop and let me off right now
I don't know why this world keeps turning round and round
But I wish it would stop and let me off right now

Yes man, as the world turns, we all experience things in life
Trials and tribulations that we all must go through
When someone wants to test us, when someone tries our patience

I hang with a bunch of hippies and wacky tobacco planters
Who swallow lit roaches and light up like jack-o-lanterns
Outsidaz baby, and we suin' the courts
Cause we dope as fuck and only get a 2 in The Source
They never shoulda booted me outta reform school
Deformed fool, taking a shit in a warm pool
'til they threw me out the Ramada Inn
I said it wasn't me, I got a twin (Oh my God, it's you! Not again!)
It all started when my mother took my bike away
Cause I murdered my guinea pig and stuck him in the microwave
After that, it was straight to the 40 ouncers
Slappin' teachers and jackin' off in front of my counselors
Class clown freshman, dressed like Les Nessman
Fuck the next lesson, I'll pass the test guessin'
And all the other kids said "Eminem is a thizz head
He'll never last, the only class he'll ever pass is phys-ed"
Maybe true, 'til I told this bitch in gym class
That she was too fat to swim laps she need a Slim Fast
(Who? Me?) Yeah, bitch you so big
You walked into Vic Tanny's and stepped on Jenny Craig
She picked me up to snap me like a skinny twig
Put me in a headlock, then I thought of my guinea pig
I felt the evilness and started transformin'
It began stormin', I heard a bunch of cheerin' fans swarmin'
Grabbed that bitch by her hair, drug her across the ground
And took her up to the highest diving board and tossed her down
Sorry coach, it's too late to tell me stop
While I drop this bitch face down and watch her belly flop

I don't know why this world keeps turning round and round
But I wish it would stop and let me off right now

As the world turns, these are the days of our lives
These are the things that we must go through, day by day

We drive around in million dollar sports cars
While little kids hide this tape from their parents like bad report cards
Outsidaz, and we suing the courts
Cause we dope as fuck and only get a 2 in The Source
Hypochondriac, hanging out at the laundromat
Where all the raunchy fat white trashy blondes be at
Dressed like a sailor, standin' by a pail of garbage
It's almost dark and I'm still tryna nail a trailor park bitch
I met a slut and said "What up? It's nice to meet ya
I'd like to treat you to a Faygo and a slice of pizza
But I'm broke as fuck and I don't get paid 'til the first of next month
But if you would care to join me, I was about to roll this next blunt
But I ain't got no weed, no Phillies, or no papers
Plus I'm a rapist and a repeated prison escapist
So give me all your money and don't try nothing funny
Cause you know your stinking ass is too fat to try to outrun me"
I went to grab my gun, that's when her ass put it on me
With an uppercut and hit me with a basket of laundry
I fell through the glass doors, started causing a scene
Slid across the floor and flew right into a washing machine
Jumped up with a broken back
Thank God I was smokin' crack all day and doped up on coke and smack
All I wanted to do was rape the bitch and snatch her purse
Now I wanna kill her but yo, I gotta catch her first
Ran through Rally's parkin' lot and took a shortcut
Saw the house she ran up in and shot her fuckin' porch up
Kicked the door down to murder this divorced slut
Looked around the room that's when I seen her bedroom door shut
I know you're in there bitch, I got my gun cocked
You might as well come out now, she said "Come in, it's unlocked"
I walked in and all I smelled was Liz Claiborne
And seen her spread across the bed naked watchin' gay porn
She said "Come here big boy, let's get acquainted"
I turned around to run, twisted my ankle and sprained it
She came at me at full speed, nothing could stop her
I shot her five times and every bullet bounced off her
I started to beg "No, please let go"
But she swallowed my fuckin' leg whole like an egg roll
With one leg left, now I'm hoppin' around crippled
I grabbed my pocket knife and sliced off her right nipple
Just tryna buy me some time then I remembered this magic trick
Duh-dah-duh-dah-duh-duh, go-go gadget dick!
Whipped that shit out, and ain't no doubt about it
It hit the ground and caused an earthquake and power outage
I shouted, now bitch, let's see who gets the best
Stuffed that shit in crooked and fucked that fat slut to death
(Come here bitch, come here, take this mothafuckin' dick bitch, come here)

I don't know why this world keeps turning round and round
But I wish it would stop and let me off right now
I don't know why this world keeps turning round and round
But I wish it would stop and let me off right now
I don't know why this world keeps turning round and round
But I wish it would stop and let me off right now

And as we go along, throughout the days of our lives
We all face small obstacles and challenges everyday
That we must go through, these are the things
That surround us through our atmosphere, every day
Every single day the world keeps turning[Verse 1]
One thousand different houses and Münchausen
Will make you wanna punch out some-fuckin'-one
"Ouch, what the fuck you hit me for?"
Scream "life" as I punch counter, it bunches out of anger
I once encountered a stranger in a dumb gown
Black hood with a scythe, shit, I'll laugh in his face, spit
Bitch gave me an extra life like, "Take this
Now get your ass back in that game, bitch
Don't take shit for granted and don't take shit, give it"
Only bull you should take is by the horns
A mixture of Whitey Ford and Mighty Thor
I everlast, pen is mightier than sword
Finish writin', then record, replenish, keep writin' more
Nothing's ridin' on it but your pride, that's all you're fightin' for
So you bite, scratch, you claw, backs to wall
No one was there to catch you fall
You pick yourself back up, you dust your jacket off
You grab your balls like they're gargantuan
And ask yourself how fuckin' bad you want it
Pull out your pass for whoopin' ass and flash it on 'em
Nobody's gonna back you in that corner, you're a hornet
No one's more ignorant than you fuckin' four in the mornin'
You're at the la-bor-atory
Stormin' like there's nothin' that's more important
Emcees, you better consider this a formal warnin', you're in for it
Girl, what would you do if I said your body was off the chain
And I told you I smile every single time I saw your face?
I ain't finished, bitch, I meant in half, oil the blades
Nobody wants to play
They say I'm a spoiled lil' baby, but...

Nobody puts a baby in the corner
I'm only tryna warn ya
Cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin' a tantrum
He'll fuckin' flip on ya
Cause nobody puts a baby in the corner
I'm only tryna warn ya
Cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin' a tantrum
He'll fuckin' flip on ya cause

What goes through an addict's brain
Besides static pain and Big Daddy Kane, breakbeats and words?
An erratic train of thought like splatter paint, scatter brain, yeah
Maybe that explains why you're back but you don't rap the same
And you're lookin' way thinner
Cause your hunger got you lookin' like they took away dinner
(Chicka) "Sugar Ray" Leonard
Wouldn't sugar-coat a fuckin' booger though
Just to wipe that bitch on a hooker's coat
When you say you're a (chicka) what? (Chicka) GOAT
Now fling that bitch from your fingertips
Hope it lands on another rap singer's lips who can't think of shit
Anythin' of wit that's interestin' to spit
Yo, who's king of this fuckin' English lit?
Let your middle fingers flip on each hand while extendin' this shit
How low can you go?
Lower then Chuck D, ho, hear the bassiness in my voice
Rocky's back, where's my Adrians?
Nobody's crazy as Shady in an eighty million mile radius
I'm what Tom Brady is to the Patriots to rap
I'm not a man, I'm a weapon who just happened to be a rapper
Who just happen to be on the crapper
When it happened, I had an epiphany in the bathroom
I'd never be the same after
Now I'm back with an appe-tite for destruction
And a fuckin' recipe for disaster
So let's eat cause I'm famished, every deed is a dastardly one
Evilish bastard, even you askin' for me to be po-lite
To people is like me havin' my teeth pulled

Nobody puts a baby in the corner
I'm only tryna warn ya
Cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin' a tantrum
He'll fuckin' flip on ya
Cause nobody puts a baby in the corner
I'm only tryna warn ya
Cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin' a tantrum
He'll fuckin' flip on ya cause

So step inside a dimension
Demented side of a mind that's like an inside of an engine
While I multiply your undivided attention
But be reminded if I didn't mention I lose my mind and my temper
You'll be the first one who finds him offensive
Got him climbin' the fences, lost some time to addiction
But look up rhyme in the dictio-nary, I'm in the picture
Eminem is the synonym for it, I'm an enigma
Fuck it, let's get to the meatballs
I'm gonna skip the veg and potatoes, edumacator
They are shit, legends are made of spit, treacherous data
Shit that you would say to your worst enemy
This wretched is what you get when you mix Treach with a Jada
Then combine 'em with Method Man and Redman
With metham-phetamines in his left hand
In his right is a sledgehammer
In pajamas, standin' in front of a webcam
Beatin' himself in the head 'til Russell lets him off Def Jam
Maybe I need my head examined
Hannibal Lecter with a dead lamb
Hangin' from his ceilin', drippin' with a bed pan
I need meds, swear to God
Cause if I go off the edge, T.I. ain't talkin' me off the ledge, man
Heart-throb, better fart, ah
Nah, more like a smart slob
Part Blob that'll stab you with a sharp ob-ject to the heart
And leave claw marks all over the Wal-Mart walls
Little baby with large balls
Fuck mud-slingin', I'm blood-flingin'
There's nothin' on this fuckin' Earth
Better than bein' the king of the playground
I hate the swings, but I love bein' an underdog
Cause when I'm pushed, I end up swingin' (Ah!)

Nobody puts a baby in the corner
I'm only tryna warn ya
Cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin' a tantrum
He'll fuckin' flip on ya
Cause nobody puts a baby in the corner
I'm only tryna warn ya
Cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin' a tantrum
He'll fuckin' flip on ya cause[Police voice]
Attention all units, attention all units
We have an all-points bulletin out on a man with green hair
I repeat, we have an APB on a man with green hair
He's armed with a knife, I repeat, he's armed with a knife
Proceed with caution, watch your back fellas
He could be coming at your girlfriend next

There's a joker on the loose from the psychiatric ward
His face is up on the bulletin board with a reward
He'll stab you with a sword don't be fooled by his charm
He's probably armed with intent to do bodily harm
Ring the alarm, look for a man with green hair
Check at your girl's house, he was last seen there
He's has a mean stare but usually cracks jokes
Good luck on your mission and guard your backs, folks

Come here you fuckin' backstabber
(Why I oughta) beat a bitch snake from the hood, haha
Come here you fuckin' backstabber
(Why I oughta)
Stay away from him, he ain’t no good!

We got the walkie-talkies to keep us all informed
Suited up head to toe in detective uniforms
Our unit storms in, we split the ghetto in sectors
Locking down every block and put up metal detectors
Protect yours and be sure that you stand close
Watch each other's backs and guard your command post
And most of all be advised that he's wise
He could be disguised as one of your very own guys


I'm on a solo mission to find him personally
To settle the score and beat then him unmercifully
For what he first did to me
It's sure to be the last
Following footprints with a magnifying glass
To drag his lying ass back to his padded cell
I'm mad as hell, on the trail of this tattle tail
I heard a yell the voice sounded familiar
"Give me your girlfriend or I'm gonna kill ya"


I followed the voice that led down a flight of steps
Sneezing at dust, and swinging at the spider webs
Inside the depths of his basement
I taste lint in my mouth, then the lights in the place went!
I saw my life flash in front of my eyes
I felt a butcher knife slash at one of my thighs
None of my guys knew where I'm at I was doomed
Then I remembered the flashlight in my costume


Dealing with backstabbers there was one thing I learned
They're only powerful when you got your back turned
I yearned for the day that we finally met again
So I can give him a taste of his own medicine
He shed his skin, then he promised to come clean
I took his butcher knife and jabbed it into his spleen
Cuffed him at the scene then dragged the fella home
Beating him over the head with the telephone

Attention all cars, attention all cars
Unit 313 has apprehended the suspect
He's going back to the crazy home, I repeat
He's going back to the crazy home, job well done!


It's like I'm in this dirt, digging up old hurt
Tried everything to get my mind off you, it won't work
All it takes is one song on the radio
You're right back on it reminding me all over again
How you fucking just brushed me off and left me so burnt
Spent a lot of time trying to soul search
Maybe I needed to grow up a little first
Well, looks like I hit a growth spurt
But I'm coming for closure
Don't suppose an explanation I'm owed
For the way that you turned your back on me
Just when I may have needed you most
Oh, you thought it was over?
You could just close the
Chapter and go about your life, like it was nothing
You ruined mine, but you seem to be doing fine
Well, I've never recovered, but tonight I bet ya that what
You're 'bout to go through's tougher than anything I ever have suffered
Can't think of a better way to define poetic justice
Can I hold grudges, mind saying, "Let it go, fuck this"
Heart's saying: "I will, once I bury this bitch alive
Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset"

I flee the scene like it was my last ride
You see right through, oh you had me pegged the first time
You can see the truth but it's easier to justify
What's bad is good
And I hate to be the bad guy
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me I ruh-uh-un, follow me I ruh-uh-un)
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me I ruh-uh-un, follow me I ruh-uh-un)

And to think, I used to think you was the shit, bitch
To think it was you at one time I worshipped, shit
Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it
Not this time, you better go and get the sewing kit, bitch
Finish this stitch so you can reap what you sew, nitwit
Thought some time would pass and I'd forget it? Forget it
You left our family in shambles
And you expect me to just get over him, pretend he never existed?
May be gone, but he's not forgotten
And don't think cause he's been out the pictures
So long that I've stopped the plotting and still ain't coming to getcha
You're wrong and that shit was rotten
And the way you played him, same shit you did to me; cold
Have you any idea the shit that I've gone through?
Feelings I harbor, all this pent up resentment I hold on to
Not once you call to ask me how I'm doing
Letters, you don't respond to 'em
Fuck it, I'm coming to see you
And gee who better to talk to than you, the cause of my problems
My life is garbage and I'm 'bout to take it out on you
Poof, then I'm gone, voosh
And...

I flee the scene like it was my last ride
You see right through, oh you had me pegged the first time
You can see the truth but it's easier to justify
What's bad is good
And I hate to be the bad guy
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me I ruh-uh-un, follow me I ruh-uh-un)
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me I ruh-uh-un, follow me I ruh-uh-un)

I've been driving around your side of this town
Like nine frickin' hours and forty-five minutes now
Finally I found your new address, park in your drive
Feel like I've been waiting on this moment all of my life
And it's now arrived, and my mouth is full of saliva
My knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house
See, it's sad it came to this point
Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment to come and see ya
But I ain't here for your empathy
I don't need your apology, or your friendship or sympathy
It's revenge that I seek
So I sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window
Like I reach my full potential, I peeked
Continue to peep, still bent low, then keep
Tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo, sneak
All the way 'round to the back porch, man
Door handles unlocked
Shouldn't be that easy to do this
You don't plan for intruders beforehand
Surprised to see me? Cat got your tongue?
Gag, chloroform rag
Gag, almost hack-up a lung, like you picked an axe up and swung, stick to the core plan
Dragged to the back of a trunk by one of your fans
Irony's spectacular, huh?
Now who's a faggot, you punk
And here's your Bronco hat; you can have that shit back cause they suck
It's just me, you and the music now, Slim, I hope you hear it
We're in a car right now, wait, here comes my favorite lyric
"I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die"
And hey, here's a sequel to my Mathers LP just to try to get people to buy
How's this for publicity stunt, this should be fun
Last album now, cause after this you'll be officially done
Eminem killed by M and M, Matthew Mitchell
Bitch, I even have your initials
I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother but fuck it
Since you're in love with your city so much
I figured, what the fuck the best place you could be buried alive is right here
Two more exits, time is quite near
Hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear
That sirens I hear
Guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea
As cops appear in my driver's side mirror
(Oh, God, police aaaghh)
Hope Foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot, at least
New plan Stan, Slim "chauvinist pig drove in this big Lincoln Town Car"
Well gotta go, almost at the bridge
Ha ha big bro it's for you, Slim, this is for him
And Frank Ocean; oh, hope you can swim good
Now say you hate homos again


I also represent anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend
I'm the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in
I'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen
Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
Nope, it's hopeless, I'm the denial that you're hopelessly in
When they say all of this is approaching its end
But you refuse to believe that it's over
Here we go all over again
Back's to the wall, I'm stacking up all them odds
Toilets clogged, yeah cause I'm talking a lot of shit but I'm backing it all up
But in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollers after the track is demolished
"I am your lack of a conscience"
I'm the ringing in your ears
I'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils
Eatin' your vocal chords after your concerts
I'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged
Grab for some water but I'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow
I'm the bullies you hate
That you became with every faggot you slaughtered
Coming back on you, every woman you insult, batter but the double-standards you have when it comes to your daughters
I represent everything, you take for granted
Cause Marshall Mathers the rapper's persona's half a facade
And Matthew and Stan's just symbolic
Of you not knowing what you had 'til it's gone
Cause after all the glitz and the glam
No more fans that are calling your name
Cameras are off
Sad, but it happens to all of 'em
I'm the hindsight to say, “I told you so”
Foreshadows of all the, things that are to follow
I'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow
If you don't stop after they call ya
Biggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it quits
When it's time to walk away, I'm every guilt trip
The baggage you have but, as you gather up all your possessions
If there's anything you have left to say
'Less it makes an impact, then don't bother
So 'fore you rest your case
Better make sure you're packing a wallop
So one last time
I'm back, before it fades into black and it's all over
Behold the, final chapter in a saga
Trying to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
Twice, the magic that started
It all, tragic portrait of an artist tortured trapped in his own drawings
Tap into thoughts blacker and darker
Than anything imaginable, here goes a wild stab in the dark, uh
As we (I) pick up where the last Mathers left off[Hook]
(Just pull the plug!)
People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin' to it
They say I'm suicidal, teenagers' newest idol (c'mon!)
C'mon do as I do, go ahead get mad and do it
(Just pull the plug!)
People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin' to it
They say I'm suicidal, teenagers' newest idol
C'mon, do as I do, go ahead, get mad and do it
(Just let it go!)

Hand me an eighth, beam me up and land me in space
Imma sit on top of the world (I'm here)
And shit on Brandy and Mase
I'm more than ill
Scarier than a white journalist in a room with Lauryn Hill
Human horror film
But with a lot funnier plot, and people'll feel me
Cause I'mma still be the Mad Rapper, whether I got money or not
As long as I'm on pills, and I got plenty of pot
I'll be in a canoe paddling, makin fun of your yacht
But I would like an award
For the best rapper to get one mic in The Source
And a wardrobe I can afford
Otherwise I might just end up back striking at Ford
And you wonder what the fuck I need more Vicodin for?
Everybody's pissing me off; even the No Limit Tank
Looks like a middle finger sideways flipping me off
No shit I'm a great danger to my health
Why else would I kill you then jump in a grave and bury myself?


I'm the illest rapper to hold the cordless, patrolling corners
Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
I'm meaner in action than Roscoe beating James Todd Sr
Across the back with vacuum cleaner attachments
I grew up in a wild hood, as a hazardous youth
With a fucked up childhood, that I used as an excuse
And ain't shit changed, I kept the same mindstate
Since the third time that I failed 9th grade
You probably think that I'm a negative person, don't be so sure of it
I don't promote violence, I just encourage it
I laugh at the sight of death
As I fall down a cement flight of steps
And land inside a bed of spider webs
So throw caution to the wind; you and a friend
Can jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again
Shit, why not, blow your brain out, I'm blowin' mine out
Fuck it, you only live once, you might as well die now!


My laser disc'll make you take a razor to your wrist
Make you satanistic, make you take the pistol to your face
And place the clip and cock it back
And let it go until your brains are rippin' out
Your skull so bad to sew you back would be a waste of stitches
I'm not a role model, I don't wanna babysit kids
I got one little girl, and Hailie Jade is Shady's business
And Shady's just an alias I made to make you pissed off
Where the fuck were you when Gilbert's paid to make me dishwash?
I make a couple statements and now look how crazy shit got
You made me get a bigger attitude than 80 Kim Scotts
And she almost got the same fate that Grady's bitch got
I knew that "Just the Two of Us" would make you hate me this much
And "Just the Two of Us," that ain't got shit to do with us
And our personal life, it's just words on a mic
So you can call me a punk, a pervert or a chauvinist pig
But the funny shit is that I still go with the bitch!


I reckon you ain't familiar with these here parts
You know, there's a story behind that there saloon
Twenty years ago, two outlaws took this whole town over
Sheriffs couldn't stop 'em
Quickest damn gun-slingers I've ever seen
Got murdered in cold-blood
That old saloon there was their little "home away from home"
They say the ghosts of Bad and Evil still live in that tavern
And on a quiet night
You can still hear the footsteps of Slim Shady and Royce da 5'9"

I don't speak, I float in the air wrapped in a sheet
I'm not a real person, I'm a ghost trapped in a beat
I translate when my voice is read through a seismograph
And a noise is spread, picked up and transmitted through Royce's head
Trap him in his room, possess him and hoist his bed
Til the evilness flows through his blood like poisonous lead
Told him each one of his boys is dead
I asked him to come to the dark side
He made a choice and said...

Who hard? Yo I done heard worse
We can get in two cars and accelerate at each other
To see which one'll swerve first
Two blind bandits panic whose mental capacity holds
That of a globe on top of nine other planets
Kissed the cheek of the Devil
Intelligence level is hellier than treble peaking on speakers in the ghetto
Dismissal, I'm not a fair man
Disgraced the race of an atheist
Intercepting missiles with my bare hands like a patriot
One track sliced without swords
I buried the Christ corpse
In my past life when the black knight mounted the white horse
And stay over-worked, it's like the Nazis and the Nation
Collaborating attempting to take over the Earth

Cause this is what happens when Bad meets Evil
And we hit the trees til we look like Vietnamese people
He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Seagal
Above the law cause I don't agree with police either (Shit, me neither)

We ain't eager to be legal
So please leave me with the keys to your Jeep Eagle
I breathe ether in three lethal amounts
While I stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle
Releasing rage on anybody in squeezing range
Cold enough to make the seasons change into freezing rain
(He's insane)
No I'm not, I just want to shoot up and I'm pissed off
Cause I can't find a decent vein

The disaster with dreads
I'm bad enough to commit suicide
And survive long enough to kill my soul after I'm dead
When in danger, it's funny, actually my flavor's similar to a waiter
Cause I serve any stranger with money
I spray a hundred, man until they joint chains
While slipping bullets at point-blank range like they was punches
Piss on a flag and burn it, murder you then come to your funeral
Service lobby and strangle your body to confirm it
Whipping human ass, throwing blows, cracking jaws
With my fists wrapped in gauze, dipped in glue and glass
I'm blazing MCs, at the same time amazing MCs
Somehow, MCs ain't that eyebrow-raising to me
From all of angles of us, flash a Mack loud enough
To cast a avalanche and bust till volcanoes erupt

I used to be a loudmouth, remember me?
I'm the one who burned your house down, well I'm out now
And this time I'm coming back to blow your house up
And I ain't gon' leave you a window to jump out of
Give me two fat tabs and three shrooms
And you won't see me like fat people in steam rooms
And when I go to hell and I'm getting ready to leave
I'ma put air in a bag and charge people to breathe

Cause this is what happens when Bad meets Evil
And we hit the trees 'til we look like Vietnamese people
He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Seagal
Against peaceful, see you in hell for the sequel

(We'll be waiting) See you in hell
Wall Street, Royce Da 5'9", Slim Shady
See you in hell for the sequel (bye-bye)
Bad Meets Evil, what ('til next time)

And so that's the story when Bad meets Evil
Two of the most wanted individuals in the county
Made Jesse James and Billy the Kid look like law-abiding citizens
It's too bad they had to go out the way they did
Got shot in the back coming out of that old saloon
But their spirits still live on till this day
Shhh...[spits] wait, did y'all hear that?[Produced by Dr. Seuss]

Arsonist, blocking a fire hose where the nozzle is
Go to hospitals, steal the blood that tests positive
Take it home, pour it in a cup and drink lots of it
Trying on your mother's clothes, trying to get these bras to fit
When she comes home, I'm waiting in the closet, with
A﻿ knife, hiding so quiet she'll probably hear the faucet drip
All my life I've been a foster kid
So if I die an early death suicide's gon' be the cause of it

Who hard? yo I done heard worse
We can get in two cars and accelerate at each other
To see which one'll swerve first
Two blind bandits panic, whose mental capacity holds
That of a globe on top of nine other planets
Kissed the cheek of the devil
Intelligence level is hell-ier than treble peakin on speakers in the ghetto
Dismissal, I'm not a fair man, disgraced the race of a atheist
Intercepting missles wit my bare hands like a patriot
One track sliced without swords, I buried the Christ corpse
In my past life when the Black Knight mounted the white horse
Then one get at you, dash you in the back of a Chevrolet
Spittin shit at you faster than your eardrum could ever play

Cuz this is what happens when Bad Meets Evil
We hit the trees till we look like Vietnamese people
He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Seagal
Above the Law cuz I don't agree wit police either (shit, me neither)

We ain't eager to be legal
So please leave me wit the keys to your Jeep Eagle
I breathe ether in three lethal amounts

Releasin rage on anybody in squeezing range
Cold enough to make the seasons change into freezing rain
(He's insane) No I'm not, I just want to shoot up and I'm pissed off
Cuz I can't find a decent vein

The disaster wit dreds
I'm bad enough to commit suicide and survive long enough
To kill my soul after I'm dead
When in danger it's funny actually my flavor's similar to a waiter
Cuz I serve any stranger wit money
I spray a hundred, man until they joint chains
While slippin bullets at point blank range like they was punches
I got a lot of evil; I got knowledge peeking out of my cerebral now that I got people locked and rock evil
While still on the beat, I hit you in your ribs so hard to think its just a touch to the floor, while your still on your feet
I'm blazin MC's, at the same time amazin MC's Somehow MC's ain't that eye-brow raisin to me
Destroying the track, un-employing the whack, exploring the facts while my man Eminem is withdrawing from crack

I just love him..
I just love him..

Who hard? yo I done heard worse

Oh! It's music to my ears!
Oh, man
How can I describe... The way I feel?
Fucking great, man
Ok, let me see
How can I begin?

Locked in Mariah's wine cellar all I had for lunch
Was bread, wine, more bread, wine and Captain Crunch
Red wine for breakfast and for brunch
And to soak it up an in-between snack crackers to munch
Mariah whatever happened to us? Why did we have to break up?
All I asked for was a glass of punch!
You see I never really asked for much
I can't imagine what's going through your mind after such
A nasty break-up with that Latin hunk
Luis Miguel Nick Cannon better back the fuck
Up, I'm not playin', I want her back, you punk
This is Hello Kitty bedspread satin funk
Mixed with Egyptian with a little rap and punk
Zapp and Eric Clapton, Shaft, Frank Zappa, crunk
And yeah baby I want another crack at ya
You can beat me with any spatula that you want
I mean I really want you bad, you cunt
Nick you had your fun, I've come to kick you in your sack of junk
Man I could use a fresh batch of blood
So prepare your vernacular for Dracula acupuncture

Bagpipes from Baghdad
When will it ever cease
For Pete's sakes he's crazy to say the least
Bagpipes from Baghdad
What's goin through my mind
Half the time when I rhyme we're blowin up like
Bagpipes from Baghdad
Somebody turn the vacancy sign on
Cause I'm gone, blowing up my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
I run the streets and act
Like a madman holdin a Glad bag

You can be a permanent fixture in my lyrical mixture
I'm the miracle whip... trickster
My signature sound when a tube of lipstick's around
I'm bound to put it on in an instant, wow man
What an ensemble, what an assortment of pharma-
-ceuticals this beautiful pill dust in my palm, my
Cuticles get residue just from touchin the bottle
Never knew I could remind me so much of my momma
I'll cut ya like Dahmer, pull the butcher knife on ya
The size of a sword boy I'm like the fuckin Red Sonja
Get it stuck in your cornea, nice knowin ya, Norman
You're so fuckin' annoyin', drop the shovel boy
You don't know what the fuck you're doin
I ain't playin' no fuckin' more
Nick Cannon, you prick, I wish you luck with the fuckin' whore
Every minute there's a sucker born, snuck up on
Malachi made the motherfucker suck on a shuck of corn
Shuck of, shuck of corn, Chaka Khan
Hit Jason in the face with a hockey puck and told him it's fucking on
Man what the fuck are ya doin'
You're runnin over the snowblower with the lawnmower
Blowin' your bagpipes from Baghdad


In the bed with two brain dead lesbian vegetables
I bet you they become heterosexual
Nothing will stop me from molestin' you
Titty-fuckin' you til' your breast nipple flesh tickles my testicles
Is what they said to the two conjoined twins
How's it going girlfriends, you need a boyfriend
You need some ointment, just set up an appointment
Who's gonna see the doctor first, we'll do a coin flip
I just got my one-year sobriety coin chip
When the bad get goin, how bad does the going get
Baby you shouldn't have any trouble rubbin groins wit
Each other especially when you're joined at the hip
I'm going to get the needle and thread from the sewing kit
An attempt to separate 'em and stitch 'em back at the loins, shit
Lure the little boy with the chocolate chips ahoy! chip-
Cookie lookie even took me a Polaroid flick


Hghum-day-li-laaa-aaa-aaa-aaa-aa-aah-aah[Intro]
Ya, We gots money baby, I'm talking about, talking about that long money, when you see us come through, you just know...

Ballin' Uncontrollably

Man, I got everything candy-painted, candy-painted tint, it's so dark
I'd be lying if I said I ain't hit at least nine of my friends
Plus, I got so much candy paint in my rims
Paint be flyin' off my car be candy paintin' the neighborhood kids
I got that whole block lookin' like it's Candyland
Ask about me, man, they be like, there go the candy man
I park the car in the garage and go in and
Come back the next mornin', the rims are still spinnin'
Hit the doors on that Phantom, man, that shit looks like the Batmobile
Thirty-two inch rims, shit, I ain't even got no wheels
Custom-fitted, custom-kitted wood grain
Custom everything, what's that on the seat, custom mustard stain
Now let's go hit the mall, y'all know that we finna ball
Get out the car, they be like, ah, there go them superstars
Hit every single store, flash a fuckin' wad of cash
But I ain't buying shit, bitch, kiss my candy-painted ass, we


Hit the corner liquor store to get Corona, tip the owners
Sipped it on the way out as I dipped, I wanna rip the road up
And I'mma hit the cinema and I'mma get the hoes
When I be at a theater shit, anything goes
I'm ballin' outta control, girls know I'm loaded with dough
But shit, I'm stingy as fuck, I'm fuckin' stingy as hoes
These bitches don't get a crumb, and it come but I'm like what up
Shut up, bitch, sit up, get up off them knees, my candy paint's enough
If you're lucky, I'll let you hug me, but that's all you get
Then I'mma split, disappear, a cloud of smoke is all you see


Bitch, get the fuck out my car if we ain't finna fuck
I'm horny as fuck bitch, are you suckin' my dick or what
I'll fuck a chick in the butt, I really don't give a shit
Is pretty Marshall gonna have to go choke me a bitch
You fuckin' keyed up my Benz bitch, I beat up my friends
Don't think I won't beat a bitch, I'll kick a six-year-old in the ribs
You fuckin' retard, I'll have you suckin' farts out my seat
I'll teach you not to know how to control your bowels when you eat
What the fuck do you think that colostomy bag is for, looks?
I ain't waste nine bullets on you for you to not sing no hooks
I fuckin' take a Make a Wish Foundation patient with me
How 'bout some coke inside of your saline solution IV
Turn around and use it on me, you tryna snort all my keys
You fuckin' get in back, you're comin' to Florida with me
Tell your momma I'mma drop you off at the hospital later
We finna make this run, take this gun and cover me, Slater and quit your



Tracy, I joined this class cuz I thought I’d be cooking with a partner
But she’s never here, and I don’t get twice the credit for all the work

I didn't invent odd numbers Seth

I know, but I’m over here in my unit, everyday, cooking my terrible tasting food, and then I gotta look over at Evan, I mean look at him, it looks like the most fun I’ve ever seen in my entire life. And, I’m just saying, I wash and dry, I’m like a single mother. And, no offense but, everyone takes this class to get an A and it’s bullshit, but uh no offense, I’m just saying. And I’m not putting down your profession, but when am I gonna need to cook tiramisu? Am I gonna be a chef? No. There’s 3 weeks left in school, give me a freaking break, sorry for cursing.OH MY GOD that’s like the coolest fucking story I’ve ever heard in my life, it’s insane. Can you tell us again? Do you have time? Tracy, Tracy, can you hear me? I’m in the car right now. Listen, I am McLovin, yeah. McLovin in the house! McLovin in the house! YeahBust it
The final problem is solved by throwin' sulfuric acid all over your back to see your spinal column dissolve
Droppin' bodies like it was domino season
My phenomenal legion will shoot out your fuckin' abdominal region
Slim Shady, responsible for your permanent stillness
Just escaped from the hospital with terminal illness
Itchin' to rip your fuckin' frame out
Cuz I ain't got nothing to lose like that movie that just came out
Callin' your name out, first, last and your middle initial
Your mom, your dad, and your pregnant widow will miss you
And anybody else poppin' some shit'll go witchu
Cuz I ain't tryna hear it like a political issue
So until I can leave with enough funds
I'mma shove guns up in the mouths of your loved ones
Drown 'em face down in the bath while the tub runs
Got a rap sheet that's longer than Tubby's sub buns


And I'mma kill it, so y'all think that I can come of the top
And I be forced to rock unorthodox styles from off the top of the dome
With a popular poem, Forget a damn team I can stop you alone
Rapper's thinking they putting out they records cause they sell
But that can't fuck with what me, we doing here with AL
Y'all don't wanna do it, when we kick it, when we kick the fluid
Rappers don't wanna get into it, Y'all knew it
Cause the feds want me, they headhunt me, I'm Ted Bundy
I ain't dead, I just fled country
Said bluntly, a cannibal animal, fed monthly
Eating bread crunchy, cement bed's comfy
Head's lumpy, funky like a dead skunk be
Med flunkie, jump off cliffs with thread bungee
Wearing red undees and a black cape
Rollin' through the hood cracked out bumping' your wack tape
I'm coming through dumpin'
Change your rap name to Richard Jewell, cause you ain't blowing up nothing
I'm showing up puffin', throwing up drinkin'
Killing brain cells till I'm slowing up thinking
Growing up stinkin', born with bad odor
Gimme Hennessey but please don't add soda
Now who's doper? You couldn't beat me when I'm sober
I'm off my fuckin' rocker like your Grandma tipping over, Slim Shady


"Son, where you from son?"
"Yo, I'm from Detroit city"
"Uh huh"
"I'm bout to do a little something like this. A little something like this."
"Ok, drop that shit."
"Bust it, bust it"

Yo, I hang with a bunch of hippies and wacky tobacco planters
Who swallow lit roaches and light up like jack-o-lanterns
Outsidaz baby, and we suin' the courts
Cause we dope as fuck and only get a two in the Source
Yo, they never shoulda booted me outta reform school
Deformed fool, taking a shit in a warm pool
Till they threw me out the Ramada Inn
I said it wasn't me, I got a twin (Oh my God, it's you! Not again!)
It all started when my mother took my bike away
Cause I murdered my guinea pig and stuck him in the microwave
After that, it was straight to the forty ouncers
Slappin' teachers and jackin' off in front of my counselors
Class clown freshman, dressed like Les Nessman
Forget the next lesson, I'll pass the test guessin'
And all the other kids said "Eminem is a thizz head
He'll never last, the only class he'll ever pass is phys-ed"
Maybe true, 'til I told this girl in gym class
That she was too fat to swim laps she need a Slim Fast
(Who? Me?) Yeah, girl you so big
You stepped, walked into Vic Tanny's and stepped on Jenny Craig
She picked me up to snap me like a skinny twig
Put me in a headlock, then I thought of my guinea pig
I felt the evilness and started transformin'
It began stormin', I heard a bunch of cheerin' fans swarmin'
Picked that bitch by her hair, drug her across the ground
And threw her up to the highest diving board to toss her down
Sorry coach, it's too late to tell me stop
While I drop this girl face down and watch her belly flop, cause it's like that
And I come in and I start wildin' and shit
Then I be busting a lyric and rappers don't believe I'm freestyling it
Well here it goes when I'm kicking lyrical flows
From your head to your toes, so that every rapper in this place knows
Cause when it comes to the freestyle coming off of the top of the dome
I'm knocking your mouth and ya off, so who you copying off?
Stop being soft, I'm standing on top of your loft
Killing you off slowly, like Roberta Flack I've never heard of wack
MCs that try to step to me, I'll break your verta-back
Or vertebrae, increase the murder rates
In 79 states... Yo, check it
I'm bout to pass the mic to the next
MC who wanna step up and flex
With the techs, but make sure your shit is fresh
Come on, wreck it, who wanna be next?


It goes like this:
Broke the rubber, busted a nut up in your mother
So how do you feel about having another little brother
Nasty motherfucker, talking trash like a trucker
Snatch your bitch up out your track, I'll smack her up and fucked her
Always talk shit high, smoking chocolate Thai
So y'all can die, just for walking by giving an awkward eye
I've lost my motherfucking marbles
Smelling like a brewery, droolin' at the way your jewelery sparkles
Head full of charcoal, smoked out brain particles
Burning holes in clothes articles
A retarded fool since I started school
Burned the weed before I learned to read, disregarded rules
Skip the classes to blaze the blunt ashes
Kissing front dashes from smashing up cars like stunt crashes
Hall passes for restrooms, chewing mushrooms
Doing rush fumes in the lunch room
Looking nervous, liquor in my thermos
Hung with hermits that carry guns without permits
Staring at the bitch with firm tits
Jacking off, aiming straight for both lips when my sperm spits


Set it off
Rappers get beheaded if they soft
Yo they get they wires crossed
Rappers try to step to me but I'm so ill I'll fire your boss
And this is all freestyle, killing it
While I'm filling it with adrenaline, rappers be feeling it
Like it was braille, so y'all can touch me anywhere
Cause I want you to feel me, Rappers wanna kill me, but they don't thrill me
So check it, I'm bout to wreck when I make the record
Cause I'm, skinny like an anorexic girl headed for the exit
Running butt naked away from just being date raped
Rappers? I twist 'em into a great shape
And throw 'em in the Great Lakes, cause I'm from the Michigan state
For fishermans' sake, I throw 'em and toss 'em in
Rappers try to step to me but this is the Holocaust and you'll never win
Cause I've forever been bent, forever demented
Rappers try to step to me but their shit is sweet-scented
And I'm demented, and if I said it I meant it
Killin' any MC cause I'm Infinite, and when it
Comes to the way that I'm spittin' lyrical infinite ammunition
And putting a clip in this lyrical track that I just be rippin'
Crushing it, killing it, taking your best line and hushing it
Taking your shit and flushing it down the toilet
Taking your biggest plot and foil it
Rappers can't uncoil it, I'll take my shit and aluminum foil it
Then throw it in the microwave and watch burn up, cause I'mma blow up
Rappers? I make 'em ill enough to throw up
Don't show up if you come to the battle


"Can I speed it up? Just a little bit?
Alright that's cool. Alright
Bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it
This one for Quest."

Some people say I'm strange, I tell them ain't shit changed
I'm still the same lame asshole with a different name
Came late to the last show with a different dame
Brain ate from the last O' that I sniffed of 'caine
You know you're spaced the fuck out like George Lucas
When your puke is turning to yellowish-orange mucus
So when I grab a pencil and squeeze it between fingers
I'm not a rapper, I'm a demon who speaks English
Freak genius, too extreme for the weak and squeamish
Burn you alive till you screaming to be extinguished
Cause when I drop the science, motherfuckers tell me to stop the violence
Start a fire and block the hydrants
I'm just a mean person, you never seen worse than
So when Slim gets this M-16 bursting
You getting spun backwards like every word of obscene cursing
On the B-side of my first single with the clean version
Stopping your short life while you're still a teen virgin
Unless you get a kidney specialist and a spleen surgeon
In the best hospital possible for emergency surgery
To try to stop the blood from your ruptured sternum internally
I'll take it back before we knew each other's name
Run in the hospital and snatch you out your mother's frame
I'll take it further back than that
Back to Lovers' lane, to the night you were thought of, and
Cock block your father's game
I'll plead the fifth like my jaws were muzzled
So suck my dick while I take a shit and do this crossword puzzle
And when I'm down with ten seconds left in the whole bout
I'mma no a head-butt so hard, I knock us both out
No doubt[Bridge]
Lately I've been hard to reach, I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world, where they can be alone
Are you calling me? Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me, and I'm reaching out for you

I'm just so fucking depressed, I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump but I need something to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises, took my lumps, fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up in order for me to pick the mic back up
I don't know how or why or when I ended up in this position I'm in
I'm starting to feel distant again, so I decided just to pick this pen
Up and try to make an attempt to vent but I just can't admit or
Come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap, I need a new outlet
And I know some shit's so hard to swallow, but I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow, but I know one fact: I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow, I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow, but you'd have to walk a thousand miles

In my shoes, just to see what it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find, look at shit through each other's eyes
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you

I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor, everything's so tense and gloom
I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature of the room just as soon as
I walk in, it's like all eyes on me, so I try to avoid any eye contact
Cause if I do that then it opens a door for conversation like I want that
I'm not looking for extra attention, I just wanna be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room, maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fuckin' man-servant, tryna follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack and half of 'em ain't even funny like, "Ha!
Marshall you're so funny man, you should be a comedian, goddamn!"
Unfortunately I am, I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down? Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes and you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles

In my shoes, just to see what it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find, look at shit through each other's eyes
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you

Nobody asked for life to deal us with these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves and flip 'em, don't expect no help
Now I could've either just sat on my ass and pissed and moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in, and get up and get my own
I was never the type of kid to wait by the door and pack his bags
And sat on the porch and hoped and prayed for a dad to show up who never did
I just wanted to fit in in every single place, every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid, even if it meant acting stupid
Aunt Edna always told me "Keep making that face it'll get stuck like that"
Meanwhile, I'm just standing there holding my tongue trying to talk *like this*
'Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old
I learned my lesson then cause I wasn't trying to impress my friends no mo'
But I already told you my whole life story not just based on my description
Cause where you see it from where you're sittin' is probably 110% different
I guess we would have to walk a mile in each other's shoes at least
What size you wear? I wear 10's, let's see if you can fit your feet

In my shoes, just to see what it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find, look at shit through each other's eyes
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you

Lately I've been hard to reach, I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world, where they can be alone
Are you calling me? Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me, and I'm reaching out for you

To my babies: stay strong, daddy'll be home soon
And to the rest of the world, God gave you them shoes that fit you
So put em on and wear 'em, be yourself, man, be proud of who you are
Even if it sounds corny, never let no one tell you you ain't beautiful[Intro]
I can feel the heat rising, everything is on fire
Today is a painful reminder of why
We can only get brighter
The further you put it behind ya
But right now I'm on the inside
(Lookin' out, cause)

I'm standin' in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

Yesterday was the tornado warning
Today's like the morning after
Your world is torn in half
You wake in its wake to start the mourning process
And rebuilding, you're still a work in progress
Today's a whole new chapter
It's like an enormous asth-ma
Thunderstorm has passed ya
You weathered it and poked its eye out
With the thorn bush that you
Used to smell the roses
Stopped to inhale, can't even tell your nose is, stuffed
So focused on the bright side
Then you floor the gas pedal
And hit the corner fast the more asserted
Never looking back
May hit the curb
But every day is a new learning curve as you
Steer through life, sometimes you might not wanna swerve
But you have to
To avert a disaster
Lucky no permanent damage
Cause they hurt you so bad
It's like they murdered your ass
And threw dirt on your casket but you've returned from the ashes
And that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline
And while you're burning the past, standing in the inferno and chant

I'm standin' in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

You're so familiarized with what having to swallow this pill is like
It happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life
And it's as though you feel you've died
Cause you've been killed inside
But yet you're still alive
Which means you will survive
Although today you may weep cause you're weakened
And everything seems so bleak and hopeless
The light that you're seekin'
It begins to seep in
That's the only thing keepin'
You from leapin' off the mothafreakin' deep end
And I'm pullin' for you to push through this feeling
And with a little time that should do the healing
And by tomorrow
You may even feel so good that you're willing to forgive 'em even after
All the shit you been put through this feeling of resilience is building
And the flames are burning quick as fire would through this building
You're sealed in but you're fireproof, flame retardant, you withstood it
And as you climb up to the roof, you're just chillin' you look down
Cause you're so over 'em
You could put the heel of your foot through the ceiling

As time passes
Things change every day
But wounds, wounds heal, but scars still remain the same
But tomorrow today's going down in flames
Throw the match, set the past ablaze

So feel the fire beneath your feet as you barely even perspire
From the heat
Exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief
And as you say goodbye to the grief
It's like watching the walls melt in your prison cell
But you've extinguished this living hell
Still a little piece of you dies as you scream

I'm standin' in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I feel the burn, watch the smoke as I turn
Rising, a phoenix from the flames
I have learned, from fighting fights, that weren't mine
Not with fists, but with wings that I will fly

I'm standin' in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light((UNRELEASED))

Yo, guys! Do you know what is this:
It is old and ugly as fuck
It looks like mutant froggy duck
He's a prick, he's a cunt
And he never smoked blunt!

Maybe Michael Jackson, hahahah...

No...

I know, that dude is Nelson Mandela!

No, guys! It is Benzino!

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAA...[Verse 1]
Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad cause my rhymes on the ra-ag
Just like I did with addiction I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence whether to picket
But quick to get it impaled when I tell 'em stick it
So sick I'm looking pale, wait that's my pigment
Bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch!
The art of MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch
Been Public Enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch

Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berserk) all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berserk) all night long

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m
So baby make just like K-Fed and let yourself go, let yourself go
Say fuck it, before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody, go berserk, grab your vial, yeah

Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it
Khakis pressed, Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced, so I guess it ain't
That aftershave or cologne that made 'em just faint
Plus I showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game, check mate
But girl, your body's banging, jump me in, dang, bang-bang
Yes siree 'Bob', I was thinking the same thang
So come get on this Kid's rock, baw with da baw, dang-dang
Pow-p-p-p-pow, chica, pow, chica, wow-wow
Got your gal blowing up a valve, valve-valve
Ain't slowing down, throw in the towel, towel-towel
Dumb it down, I don't know how, huh-huh, how-how
At least I know that I don't know
Question is are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid?
Hope so, now ho...

Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berserk) all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berserk) all night long

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m
So crank the bass up like crazy and let yourself go, let yourself go
I say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody, go berzerk, get your vinyls


They say that love is powerful as cough syrup in styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian
Lamar, oh, sorry yo, we done both set the bar low
Far as hard drugs are though that's the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow
And girl, I ain't got no money to borrow
But I am trying to find a way to get you a-loan (Car note)
Oh, Marshall Mathers
Shithead with a potty mouth, get the bar of soap lathered
Kangol's and Carheartless Cargos
Girl, you're fixing to get your heart broke
Don't be absurd, ma'am, you birdbrain baby
I ain't called anybody baby since Birdman, unless you're a swallow
Word Rick, word man you heard, but don't get discouraged girl
This is your jam, unless you got toe jam

Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berserk) all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berserk) all night long

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m
So baby make just like K-Fed and let yourself go, let yourself go
Say fuck it, before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody, go berserk, grab your vial, yeahMusic.

I had met Paul, Em's manager, a few years ago and we always talked about the possibility of getting together to work on something at some point down the road. We just worked out it was meant to be at this time. I think it's unlike any current hip hop songs. If you listen to what's going on in hip hop, this is not what this is. Em wanted to do something kind of throwback to some of the early records that we were making in the old days. And it more reflects that energy of the early days of hip hop.

We were in the studio working on a bunch of different ideas and this was one of the later ones to come up. It started with a sample and the sample that we started with ended up not being in the record. The song sort of evolves. It started one way, it kind of got programmed and written to and then it changed into a whole different song.

And I felt the track was really strong and didn't really know what direction Em was gonna go in vocally. And then when I heard the vocals, that was pretty, exciting because it was not at all what I was expecting. And just the energy in it and the lyrics and the style of it. It's so well done and so smart and so funny. It's just great. In this song, we ended up using a wired guitar and hook and everything else pretty much is programmed.

It reminds me of old hip hop videos and I think it's really entertaining and I look forward to see it all put together and done. But in the shooting stages, the pieces I've seen look really entertaining.[Estrofa 1]

Ésto está a punto de empezar, esta fiesta tiene pinta de coñazo
Vamos a volver al hip-hop puro y empezar desde cero
Voy a dejarle sangriento a este tema, echáos para atrás
Por eso mi boli necesita un cuaderno porque mi rap tiene la regla
Al igual que hice con la adicción, voy a rapear
Como un mago, a los críticos los convierto en grillos
Todavía no saben si protestarlo o comprarlo
Pero no tardan nada en ser ensartados cuando los mando a tomar por culo
Soy tan crack que se me ve pálido, pues bueno, así es mi pigmentación
Voy a darlo todo, ya bish, qué pasa Kendrick
Vamos a volver al Slim original, puta
El arte del MC mezclado con da Vinci y MC Ren
Y no me refiero al amigo de Stimpy, puta
He sido enemigo público desde que pensabas que PE era la educación física


Quítate los zapatos, suéltate el pelo y vuélvete loco toda la noche
Déjate crecer la barba, sé un bicho raro y vuélvete loco toda la noche


Vamos a darlo todo hasta derrumbar la casa
Así que sube el volumen, porque va a ser un caos hasta la madrugada
Así que nena, haz como K-Fed y pierde control, pierde control
Di que te la pela todo, antes de que la diñemos
La vida es demasiado corta como para no echarle toda la carne al asador
Así que todo el mundo, todo el mundo, volvéos locos, bailad



Será por cómo me visto, verdad?
Pantalón planchado, Nikes sin estrenar
Así que supongo que no ha sido
La colonia o la loción aftershave que les ha hecho desmayarse
Además, acabo de aparecer con un abrigo más guay que la pintura fresca
Así que, si el amor es una partida de ajedrez, jaque mate
Pero tu chica tiene cuerpazo, quiero unirme, gang - bang-bang
Si señor, estaba pensando lo mismo
Así que ven a subirte a la piedra de este chaval (Kid Rock), baw-wit-da-baw dang-dang
P-p-p pow-pow chicka-chicka wow-wow
Coger un taxi, quiero bajar b-b-bow, bow
Ir más despacio, tirar la toalla, t-t-towel toww
Bajar el nivel, no sé cómo (huh-huh) how-how
Por lo menos sé que no lo sé
La pregunta es si vosotros payasos son suficientemente listos como para sentiros estúpidos
Espero que sí, y ahora perra...



Se dice que el amor es tan fuerte como el jarabe de tos y el poliestireno
Pero lo que está claro es que me quedé dormido y me desperté en aquel Monte Carlo
Con la Kardashian fea
Lamar, ah, lo siento, hemos puesto el listón muy bajo los dos
Rimas duras, drogas duras, aunque eso es el pasado
Pero he tomado codeína suficiente como para lanzar Future al día siguiente
Nena, no tengo dinero que prestarte
Pero estoy buscando una manera de estar contigo sola, financiación!
Oh, Marshall Mathers, todos deberían saberlo ya
Haced espuma con el jabón de barra, Kangols y Carhartt-less Cargos
Nena vas a acabar con el corazón roto, no digas tonterías
Niña lerda, no le he dicho "baby" a nadie desde Birdman
A no ser que eres una golondrina
Eso es lo que hay, pero no te desanimes nena
Este es tu tema, a menos que tengas mugre entre los dedos del pie...

Welcome to Detroit
This is the BET, Shady 2.0 Cypher 2011
Myself, Slaughterhouse and Yelawolf
White Dawg (thank you cracker) get 'em!

Put these mothafuckas in a box and I send em away
Put em in a gray 'llac and pop the trunk
And throw em in the back, jack; ha, dig em a grave
Put a brick inside that Xerox when I print up a page
Moving keys I can relate, cause I live in the cage
I throw up the A, I take em to school, I give them a grade
An Eazy-E for effort, that's WWA
White with an attitude, alphabet soup is on my plate
All I got is Z's they sleeping on me, I can't get em awake
I spoon feed em a sound in a room full of deceivers and clowns
Who believe in making it rain cause all they see is the clouds
And I watch from the couch of the VIP like a potato
With a bunch of meatheads like fuck it, I'll just feed 'em a cow
Plenty of white boys to pick from this year
But before you pick a pepper, you better pick up your heater
Cause even Peter Piper could pick up a mic but what it's like
To pick a fight with me is like putting Nikes on a cheetah
Better speed up, or at least in my case Adidas
I'm out this bitch, drinking Sprite by the two-liter
Holler
Shady Records

Say I'm from the new school, I'mma say check your tone and watch your mouth
If they teaching how to Dougie, I'm condoning dropping out
Forced to wild, y'all birthed me then gave me up
I just perfected being hip-hop's foster child, now check it
Don't blame y'all for being trash, fans are copping it
The radio's the crime scene, the masses are the hostages
In my youth I'd throw shots, the fad was dodging it
I'm grown, I ain't watching the throne, I'm sabotaging it
You see that four-headed monster in the storm looms
Snipe 'em from a distance: the scope got a long zoom
You Super Mario thugs is in the wrong room
Gotta figure here, you won't get bigger if you on shrooms
If it was left to me, I'd revive what the game be 'bout
I'd 've took the wine outta Amy house
Enough raps from you scrub cats bout cockin' a snub back
Wayne couldn't teach me how to love that
But I got this chick from uptown, she my summer bunny
Both parents broke, but she come from money
Think my bread is her paper to burn
So I lock her out, and now she doubt David is Stern
She's so bad, I make her hit the telly from a taxi
Then dead her in the Holiday Inn, learned that from Max B
That's why the haters envy, kinda wanna send me llamas
I made it right before their eyes like I was Benihanas
Is it me or is what I'm hearing just pitiful
Airwaves the same, now the stereo's typical
My skin's thick so the critics ignored
So unafraid to die, you'd think I did it before
The boy's Rodman with the trash talk
Magic or Walt with the black ball
Way I bounce off the asphalt with cat paws
Glass jaw, Hood of your mask will be the Blackfoot with no passport
Body be found in a mansion in one of my trapdoors
If punks had award you status whores categore
Probably be that of awards between Michael Rappaport and Kenny Lattimore
I know hip-hop's alive and well
If it died, you other crews wouldn't survive the smell

I spot a victim, the plot'll thicken when the clock is ticking
I caught him slipping, I gotta give him a shot
I hit him with proper spitting, hottest writtens and compositions
So competition's a contradiction somebody mention they got a Crooked
Highly fiction we probably different, got Gotti henchmen
Opposition, I'll body quick as Bugatti engines
I'm on a mission to get richer, the sickest lyric-kicker
Digging a ditch for different spitters
Weak lyricists get disfigured
Sip liquor, spit like a sick mixture
Of Notorious, Pun and L, get the big picture
The poster, I'll roast ya
My mind so deadly it's just like the beanie is close to a holster
It's over, control my whole coastal region
Like I'm supposed to, flow is going postal even
Open season, heart close to freezing
Ruthless as Eazy nigga, approach, I'm squeezing believe me
Dopest Westcoaster breathing so most ya hope I'm vegan
Nope I'm beefing rappers need to keep it trill
Give me a beat to kill
Too many people still eating sleeping pills
People sleeping on my ether skills
And y'all ain't even real, you bout to die in this cypher
Before you die you should do the Jada and leave a Will
For real

I ain't a rap dude, I'm a dude who rap
Before this, I was moving crack
Killers y'all become when y'all rhyme, I salute and dap
And if I blink, they'll remove your snaps
You ain't cool, you wack with your foolish act
Skinny jeans don't mean your ass shoot, it means your booty claps
Don't play like Tyler Perry
This the Slaughterhouse of pain
Flow brown, tight and heavy
When it come to 16's, I'm a fiend
Seen in the studio near a needle with a mean lean
Probably writing bars to Nas' Thief's Theme getting my Yaowa on
Man, all these Olajuwons, we the dream team
This is an all day slaughter
They fiending for us to break like Beyonce's water
The four quarters doing all the eating
And y'all gotta know why I made the cut, I'm Puerto Rican
Ortiz keep the fire ready
And tryna put me out's like tryna steal a transvestite from Eddie

I'm do or die dope, and you can make the sticker sitting
On the door of that Phantom, your suicide note
Hi Rihanna...is Nicki living with you?
Let me know so I can buy binoculars and telescopes
Hi Rihanna...I don't need to know you better
You tell me you love my music again, we go together
Bye Rihanna... now back to y'all fools
We rock out like the outside of a guitar school
Thousand dollar frames I prefer to see the world through
Don't ask me nothing 'bout Budden, I beat my girl too
You ask me why do I keep her, I say it's cheaper to
That's why I ride around in a Rolls like Wiz Khalifa do
Rappers I'm your daddy, I tell you straight as this
You don't kill but your father will like Jayden Smith
I tell you like I tell my Spanish chick
You fly, but I ain't going down on no landing strip
So get your wax on like Daniel San
Or I'mma have to run like De la Hoya in drag when cameras come
Point out the greatest rapper alive I head shot 'em
Smack his girl on the butt and buy her some red bottom
Bring every deceased rapper back to see his wife
While I'm cyber-sexing with Jessica Alba via Skype
I’m on my D-boy, Deebo thing
Spiritual steelo swing like Cee-Lo Green
Get out the camera with yo B Roll bling
You know your flow is wack
We cornered the market like a Wal-Mart in a cul-de-sac
Yeah, this is what two million singles sold and an album that's gold
Look like without having to sell your soul

Ayo, lyrical miracle, spiritual individual, criminal
Subliminal, in your swimming pool

You're about to see peace destroyed, it'll never be restored
When I unleash these beastly hordes upon your CD stores
Wanna stop it:? You gon' need a priest, at least three swords
A license to ill from the Beastie Boys, three Ouija boards
A squeegee and please be warned, don't ask what the squeegee's for
Or the holy water, acid raps that'll eat these floors
Eat a hole in a rhyme book, you see these horns
And as for me, you ask when I'm gone, will he be mourned?
..is puke luke warm? Should Casey Anthony do porn?
Can that chick fit a new born dead baby inside a fricking shoebox
With a shoehorn
Smothered in chloroform so she can go get her groove on
Can she duct tape and Velcro a fetus
Joell, yo tell Joe I need his
Empty box from his old shell toed Adidas
So I can put these babies in the fetal position
They're getting elbows to the penis
Yeah big deal
I took some little kids Big Wheel and spit in his frickin big kids meal
Quit tryna bite me and pinch you wench sit still
Did you just put your six inch heel through my Benz windshield
Is it dust we bout to kick up
Can Yelawolf fit a fifth of rum in a big cup
Between his stick shift in his frigging pickup
And drink like a hick redneck hillbilly will til he gets hicc-ups
Flipping the script up like Mike Vick
Getting bit in his junk by a Pit, yup I'm a sick pup
I'd be a horrible magician cause I'll fuck a trick up
Fix your lips up to say something fly, or zip up
A B, let's C, you said you were gonna do X-Y-Z
Til you fuck around and get dropped like an E when you add an I-N-G
Don't put a K in front of that though, when I MC
Cause I'm not the king of this microphone booth
It's more like a phone booth
Superman in this bitch, Kryptonite won't do
It gives me more power, I bump the Fat Boys and
Eat rat poison, take meteor showers
Fresh outta the mental hospital
And me not flossing a middle finger while I hop in a mosh pit'll
Be like Nas doing gospel or R&B, you crazy
Me pushin' up daisies, that thought is impossible
As if flashin' across the news
Posdnuos was caught with a prostitute
With a huge johnson, boobs and a monstrous tube of lube
And a bra, some boots, some panties and an aqua blue Mazda
Swallowing a popsicle, playing tonsil pool
So kill the rumors it ain’t happening
I’ma rap 'til I'm fossil fuel[Intro]
I don't understand! Why are you being so MEAN?
You're a MEAN, MEAN MAN!

You are just jealous of me cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it, you walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
Cause you're a meanie, a meanie
But it's only cause you're, just really jealous of me
Cause I'm what you want to be, so you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things, cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie

Alright listen, I need you to focus
I need you to go dig deep in your mind, this is important
We are going to perform an experiment of the sorts
I'm going to have to ask you to bear with me for a moment
Now I need you to open, your mind - your eyes close 'em
You are now about to be placed under my hypnosis
For the next four and a half minutes, we are going to explore
Into your mind to find out why you're so fucking jealous
Now why did they make Yoo-Hoo? Pippity ga-ga poo-poo
Psych I'm kidding, I just wanted to see if you're still listening
Okay, now I need your undivided attention
Sir I have a question - why do I always sense this
Undeniable tension, from the moment that I enter into the room
It gets all quiet and whispers
Whenever there's conversation, why am I always mentioned?
I've been dying to ask, it's been itching at me, is it just because


Alright now I, I just flubbed a line
I was going to say something extremely important
But I forgot who or what it was - I fucked up
Psych I'm kidding again you idiot, no I didn't
That's just what you wanted to hear from me is that I FUCKED up, ain't it?
But I can bust one take without looking at no paper
It doesn't take a bunch of takes or me to stand here in this booth all day
For me to say the truth, okay? You're drooling, you have tooth decay
Your mouth is open, you're disgusting, what the fuck you eat for lunch?
A bunch of sweets or something, what? You munch a bunch of Crunch 'N Munch?
Your tooth is rotten to the gum, your breath stinks, wanna chew some gum?
Yes I do sir, what am I on? You sir, are on truth serum
"Marshall I'm so jealous of you, please say you won't tell nobody
I'd be so embarrassed, I'm just absolutely terrified
That someone's gonna find out why I'm saying all these terrible
Evil and awful mean things, it's my own insecurities!"


Alright now we, we're going to conduct
That experiment that we were talking about earlier
Just to see what a frog, looks like when it takes two hits of ecstasy
Cause that's exactly what your eyes look like, want to check to see?
Here's a mirror, notice the resemblance here?
Wait, let me put these sunglasses on, now look in this mirror
How about now? What do you have in common?
You're both green with envy and look like idiots with sunglasses on 'em
You look like I sound like, singing about weenies
Now take my weenie out of your mouth
This is between me and you, I know you're not happy
I know you'd much rather see me lying in the corner of a room
Somewhere crying, curled up in a ball tweaked out of my mind dying
There is no denying that my weenie is much bigger than yours is
Mine is like sticking a banana between two oranges
Why you even doing this to yourself, it's pointless
Why do we have to keep on going through this, this is torturous
My point is this - that if you say mean things, your weenie will shrink
Now I forgot what the chorus is, you're just a


Get the fuck off my dick!Spoken: A Rapper Imitating Eminem as Bin Laden]
Oh Dr Dre. Or should I say Dr Gay
You are very bad man, you diss the wrong motherfucker. You think Osama won't diss you back biaaatch

Things just ain't the same for Osama
So much drama since the World Trade Bombings
And the Pentagon got the whole world calling
Me to kill all of congress, like...[blurred]
The Strangest things can happen to an Afghan
When people get wrapped up in Islam and Allah
Then some shiteaters fly planes and wreak havoc
Then go drop the blame on Bin Laden
Now I got a faggot-ass rapper attacking me
With this gangsta rap, like I'm not gonna battle
Dr Dre? The man wasn't done shit since NWA
And gave Eazy-E AIDS
Don't make me go Suge Knight on your fat ass
You homofuck, you ain't the only one goin' platinum
Osama Bin Laden, keeping it gangsta
Fuck Dr Dre, I'm the Aftermath

Everywhere that I go ain't the same as before
People I used to know just don't know me no more
And everywhere that I go, I got people I know
Who've got people they know, so I suggest you lay low

Oh Dr Dre look at you, you fool
I use your own rap against you, and I'm better
Lick my balls, until they are dry
Sorry... come again *gunshot*
Things just ain't the same for Bin Laden
This planet hates me more than Michael Jackson
Hating on the Taliban for keeping me captive
Threatening to find my little cave and blast it
Now I've got to worry about this wannabe gansta
Who pays other rappers to write his wack shit
Everyone knows that your beats are helped man
And you'll never blow by yourself man
Sorry, you'd blow... blow cocks
Use the hole as a straw and blow sperm out your nostrils
I don't give a hurried fuck, call Slim Shady
Snoop Dogg, D.O.C, Wren and Jay-Z
To write a verse, fuck I'll do it for ya
You still lick dick, this is Booshu Babara
Do you know who, do you know what, do you know who?
Let's keep this between me and you


Osama...
Osama...
Oooosama...
O-o-o-osama...
Biatch[Intro Snoop Dogg & (Dr. Dre)]
(Yeah what up Detroit)
Nu-uh, nu-uh nuh no he didn't
They didn't do it again, you shitted on these niggas two times, Dr. Dre?
(Oh fo' sho')
Uh-uh, naw ya smell that, this is special right here
Yeah, it's a toast to the boogie baby, to the boogie-oogie-oogie
Yeah, y'know, what's crackin' Dre

Just let me lay back and kick some ol' simplistic pimp shit
On Slim's shit and start riots like Limp Bizkit
Throw on Guilty Conscience at concerts
And watch mosh pits til motherfuckers knock each other unconscious (Watch out nigga!)
Some of these crowds that Slim draws is rowdy as Crenshaw Boulevard
When it's packed and fulla cars
Some of these crowds me and Snoop draw is niggas from Crenshaw
From Long Beach to South Central
Whoa, not these niggas again
These grown-ass ignorant men with hair-triggers again
You and what army could harm me
D-R-E and Shady, with Doggy from Long Beach?
Came a long way, to making these songs play
It'll be a wrong move, to stare at me the wrong way
I got a long uz' and I carry it all day
Sometimes it's like a nightmare, just being Andre but I

Somehow, some way
Holla nigga, you know about Dogg-ay (Snoop Dogg)
Now let me cut these niggas up and show em where the fuck I'm coming from
I get the party cracking from the shit that I be spitting, son
Hit-and-run, get it done; get the funds, split and run
Got about fifty guns and I love all of 'em the same, bang bang
Damn baby girl what's your name
I forgot, what'd you say it was, damn a nigga buzzed
Hanging in the club with my nephew Eminem
What up cuz
The Great White American Hope
Done hooked up with the King of the motherfucking West Coast, baby

And you don't really wanna fuck, with me
Only nigga that I trust, is me
Fuck around and make me bust, this heat
(That's the devil, they always wanna dance)

I'm the Head Nigga In Charge, I'm watching you move
You're found dead in your garage with ten o'clock news coverage
Gotta love it cause I expose the facade
Your little lungs is too small to hotbox with Gods
All jokes aside, come bounce with us
Standing over you with a twelve gauge, about to bust
It's like ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I might leave in the bodybag, but never in cuffs
So who do you trust, they just not rugged enough
When things get rough I'm in the club shooting with Puff
Bitch please, you must have a mental disease
Assume the position and get back down on your knees, come on

And you don't really wanna fuck, with me
Only nigga that I trust, is me
Fuck around and make me bust, this heat
(That's the devil, they always wanna dance)
And you don't really wanna fuck, with me
Only nigga that I trust, is me
Fuck around and make me bust, this heat
(That's the devil, they always wanna dance)

Aww naww, big Slim Dogg, eighty pound balls, dick six inch long
Back up in the heezy, baby, he's Shady (he's so crazy)
Gimme the mic, let me recite til Timothy White
Pickets outside the Interscope offices every night
What if he's right, I'm just a criminal
Making a living off of the world's misery
What in the world gives me the right
To say what I like, and walk around flipping the bird
Livin' the urban life, like a White kid from the burbs
Dreaming at night of screaming at mom, scheming to leave
Run away from home and grow to be as evil as me
I just want you all to notice me and people to see
That somewhere deep down there's a decent human being in me
It just can't be found, so the reason you've been seeing this me
Is cause this is me now, the recent dude who's being this mean
So when you see me, dressin' up like a nerd on TV
Or heard the CD using the fag word so freely
It's just me being me, here want me to tone it down
Suck my fucking dick, you faggot, you happy now?
Look here, I start some trouble everywhere that I go
Ask the bouncers in the club cause they know
I start some shit they throw me out the back door
Come back and shoot the club up with a 44

And you don't really wanna fuck, with me
Only nigga that I trust, is me
Fuck around and make me bust, this heat
(That's the devil, they always wanna dance)

2001 and forever
Slim Shady
Dr. Dre
Snoop Dogg
X to the Z
Nate Dogg
Come on, yeah[Zoe on telephone]
Justin?
It's Zoe um
Kelly did not have me call however I just listened to Eminem in her car and
It is the most DISGUSTING thing I have ever heard in my entire life
And I seriously wanna call his fucking agent
And tell him how FUCKING disgusting he is
It like makes me upset
I'm now nauseous and I can't eat lunch
Goodbye[DJ scratching] - "Do it!"


Sneakin in through the back door, fruity MC's get ambushed
Rammed and squooshed, slammed and pushed, crammed and mushed
Then I'm movin on down from the right to left
So bite the meth or prepare to fight to death
To get jacked, attacked and cracked in two
Smackin through 'til youre black and blue for actin true
I'm dreaded like a man whose hair is all strands
Proof that I be sniffin on aerosol cans
I'm stompin, I'm kickin, I'm chokin, I'm stampin em
Clompin em, stickin, and pokin and clampin em
To electric chairs and tightenin bolts
Hit em with frightening jolts of lightning bolts
I'm zappin, rappers, singers, and dancers
Faster than you could snap your fingers for ransom
Cancer is in the flesh, alive and breathin
Survivin by connivin and theivin



I had a dream I was gettin jacked by biters
It felt like I was bein attacked by spiders
Developin a fear of biterphobia
I'm holdin a gas can and lighter over ya
If I detect ya, I'ma pulverize
Dissect your brain, diggin in your skull for lies
And I'ma torture, with material iller
Than a stark ravin mad serial killer
I'm more dangerous than a loaded chamber is
A major risk to a plagiarist
So beware of the aura, A terror for the horrible
Will scare ya tomorrow, is the airbourne assault of the rappers
Hit the source to better my skills
I head for the border
And run the Galloping Hills, the choice is yours
Cause now buddy's noises force me to scream til my voice is hoarse
Cause I'm sick of these jabber jaws and crap that grab at yours and savage yours to bite like Labradors
In the range of my double-barrel
And your life is in danger, trouble, and peril



I trample and stamp liars, like they were campfires
Cuz vampires bite on my balls and clamp pliers
And swing on my big thingamajig
So I'm bringin my nig Proof for backup when I sing at my gig
Cause biters are fallin head over heels
In love with every rhyme that I've said over reels
That's how I became paranoid
Chewin my fingernails, pullin my hair annoyed
Cause every time you bit it was deliberate
So I'm forced to hit a little quicker with
An ultimatum I assault and slayed em
With rhymes and it's ultimatum just to cultivate em
Energetic and imaginative
Pronouns and verbs, predicates and adjectives
Will reach out and grab ya, 9 times outta 10
That's why I'm spilling one of a kind rhymes out a pen


Yo, B-Rabbit? Ha
This silly rabbit don’t like lettuce I heard he likes dicks
Faggot niggas
With ponytails and lipstick
I’m for real
Don’t give a fuck
What, what, hoho
It’s like this
Eastside’s where I’m from
You got beef?
Hit me on the street with a badge and a gun
Fuck a badge
I’m comin through with black mags
Bout to
Do this B-Rabbit nigga cause he’s a fag
Like I said earlier in the claw...

Alright look
I can see when I put her to the test
Battling this chick…
With no breast
And why I gotta battle a chick
Especially one that’s wack…
With a dick
So you a dope MC?
Don’t get mad and start taking your period out on me
Cause I ain’t done shit to you
What’s your name confusion
Well then I guess I gotta confuse you
This ain’t something I’m used to
Why the fuck did Future even introduce you
I really don’t understand
Why this chick is up her right now who wants to be a man
On this mic is rat-a-tat-tat
Why the fuck am I up here battling Da Brat
You don’t even really wanna see this
On this microphone I will eat your fuckin fetus. Yo![Instrumental]
I'll spit a racial slur, honky sue me
The shit is a horror flick
But a black guy doesn't die in this movie
You messin' with Lotto, dawg you gotta be kiddin'
That makes me believe you really don't have an interest in livin'
You think these niggas gon' feel the shit you say?
I got a better chance joinin' the KKK
On some real shit though, I like you
That's why I didn't wanna have to be the one you commit suicide to
Fuck "Lotto", call me "Your Leader"
I feel bad that I gotta murder that dude from Leave It To Beaver
I used to like that show
Now, you got me in fight back mode
But, oh well, if you gotta go, then you gotta go
I hate to do this, I would love for this shit to last
So I'll take pictures of my rear end so you won't forget my ass
And all's well, that ends OK
So I'll end this shit with a fuck you and have a nice day

Ward, I think you were a little hard on the beaver
So was Eddie Haskell, Wally, and Ms. Cleaver
This guy keeps screamin', he's paranoid
Quick! Someone get his ass another steroid
Blah Badi Boo Blah Bah Badi Blo Blah
I ain't hear a word you said: hipidi hoo blah!
Is that a tank top or a new bra?
Look! Snoop Dogg just got a fuckin' boob job
Didn't you listen to the last round, meathead?
Pay attention! You're sayin' the same shit that he said
Matter of fact, dawg, here's a pencil
Go home, write some shit, make it suspenseful
And don't come back until somethin' dope hits you
Fuck it, you can take the mic home with you
Lookin' like a cyclone hit you
Tank top screamin', "Lotto! I don't fit you!"
You see how far the white jokes get you
Boys like, "How vanilla ice gon' diss you?"
My motto: Fuck Lotto
I'll get the seven digits from your mother for a dollar tomorrow(Verse 1: Lotto)
I'll spit a racial slur, honky sue me
This shit is a horror flick, but the black guy doesn't die in this movie
Fucking with Lotto? Dawg, you gotta be kiddin'
That makes me believe you really don't have an interest in livin'
You think these niggas gonna feel the shit you say?
I've got a better chance joining the KKK
On some real shit though, I like you
That's why I didn't wanna have to be the one you commit suicide to
Fuck "Lotto," call me your leader
I feel bad that I gotta murder that dude from "Leave it to Beaver"
I used to like that show, but now you got me in fight-back mode
But oh well, if you gotta go then you gotta go
I hate to do this, I would love for this shit to last
So I'll take pictures of my rear end so you won't forget my ass
And all's well that ends okay
So I'll end this shit with a "Fuck you" and "Have a nice day!"

(Verse 2: B-Rabbit)
Ward, I think you were a little hard on the Beaver
So was Eddie Haskell, Wally, and Ms. Cleaver
This guy keeps screaming, he's paranoid
Quick, someone get his ass another steroid
"Blah-badi-boo-blah, bah-badi-bloo-blah!"
I ain't hear a word you said: "Hippity hoopla!"
Is that a tank-top or a new bra?
Look, Snoop Dogg just got a fuckin' boobjob
Didn't you listen to the last round, meat-head?
Pay attention, you're sayin the same shit that he said
Matter of fact dawg, here's a pencil
Go home, write some shit, make it suspensful
And don't come back until something dope hits you
Fuck it, you can take the mic home with you
Looking like a cyclone hit you
Tank-top screaming, "Lotto, I don't fit you!"
We'll see how far them white jokes get you
Boys like, "How Vanilla Ice gon' diss you?"
My motto? "Fuck Lotto"
I'll get the seven digits from your mother for a dollar tomorrow[Lyckety Splyt]
This guy's a choke artist, ya catch a bad one
You're better off shooting yourself with Papa Doc's handgun
Climbing up this mountain you're weak
I'll leave you lost without a paddle, floating shit's creek
You ain't Detroit, I'm the D
You're the new kid on the block
Bout to get smacked back to the boondocks
Fucking Nazi, this crowd ain't your type
Take some real advice and form a group with Vanilla Ice
And what I tell you, you better use it
This guy's a hillbilly, this ain't Willie Nelson music
Trailer trash, I'll choke you to your last breath
And have you looking foolish
Like Cheddar Bob when he shot himself
Silly Rabbit, I know why they call you that
Cause you follow Future like you got carrots up his ass crack
And when you acting up that's when you got jacked up
And left stupid like Tina Turner when she got smacked up
I'll crack your shoulder blade
You'll get dropped so hard Elvis will start turning in his grave
I don't know why they let you out in the dark
You need to take your white ass back across 8 Mile
To the trailer park

This guy raps like his parents jerked him
He sounds like Erick Sermon, the generic version
This whole crowd looks suspicious
It's all dudes in here, except for these bitches
So I'm a German, eh?
That's ok, you look like a fuckin' worm with braids
These Leaders of the Free World rookies
Lookie, how can 6 dicks be pussies
Talking bout shits creek
Bitch, you could be up piss creek with paddles this deep
You're still gonna sink, you're a disgrace
Yeah, they call me Rabbit this is a turtle race
He can't get with me spitting this shit
Wickedly lickety shot
Suspicious spickety split lickety
So I'm gonna turn around with a great smile
And walk my white ass back across 8 Mile[Marv One]
Yo yo, y'all ready for death?
Y'all ready for death?
Marv One the fat killer
The game done got ugly
Let's go
Yo, yo
I seen your type before, you think you're tough
Battle you?
Bitch, you lucky I don't beat you up
In a game of fisticuffs, I'll push your face back
You can't fuck with me, man
Really, just face facts
It's him verses me, in a battle of ten rounds
It's like Muggsy Bogues tryin' to fuck with Jim Brown
Dumb fuck, I'm the type to run amok
Come in the club drunk as fuck
Slap your bitch so we can buck
One hook...
Type of a man the size of Dan Dierdorf
Tryin' to take his ear off like Mike Tyse
I'm quite nice on fight nights
And why he poppin' shit?
I thought he liked life?
Apparently not
I'm incoherently hot
And if I miss you
Then your parents'll be shot
Yo I'm a bad boy, bitch it's on
I'll put 44's in your chest like you Rick Mahorn

Hold on faggot, let me turn this mic on
Don't think for a minute I'm gon' let you get away with that song
That shit was wack, you ain't spittin'
As a matter of fact, all of that shit was written
And I know it wasn't for me, surely, you really must adore me,
Now look it
Yo, you might as well move  to Italy
Look, this guy's ripped...*skkkrr* Literally
You don't wanna really fuck wit this
On this microphone, I'm not Snuffleupagus
But I don't give a fuck, you can keep that dull rap
And turn your ass back around with your fuckin skullcap
And your bandana or your motherfuckin sweatband
Fuckin' with this style, you're a dead man
I ain't Redman, but on this mic, yo, I pick it up
Just like your face when I had to rip it up
You don't wanna see me
Yo, uh[Unknown]
The Shelter
Let me get up in this nigga like smashin'
With a red beam Johny blastin'
Evil is the rhyme assassin
Get a guy runnin', like haulin' ass
Bury you pink rabbits for askin'
Closed caption nigga don't say a word
When these flames get to burnin' up
Burnin' you down
Leavin' you ground tore up
From the pressure
Wanna frown
Don't want the nigga known pullin' triggers
Hoist this fool on my neck back-break this nigga

Check it out
Look, look
I gotta flow, I'm from the Mo
You ain't Detroit, ho
Talkin' about seven mile
Change your style
I read your bio
You're really from Ohio
I'm vile
This guy's so fuckin' fat
I can't even see his eyes when he smiles
Yo, listen to this motherfuckin' rhyme
Yo chicken, we can do this
As a matter of fact have another beer
I'll be right back, dawg
I'ma set the mic right here[Intro]

These are the results of a thousand electric volts
A neck with bolts
(Nurse we're losing him, check the pulse)
A kid who refused to respect adults
Wore spectacles with taped frames and a freckled nose
A corny looking White boy
Scrawny and always ornery
Cause I was always sick of brawny bullies picking on me
And I might snap, one day just like that
I decided to strike back and flatten every tire on the bike rack
My first day in junior high this kid said
It's you and I, three o'clock sharp this afternoon you die
I looked at my watch it was 1:20
I already gave you my lunch money
What more do you want from me
He said, don't try to run from me, you'll just make it worse
My palms were sweaty
And I started to shake at first
Something told me, try to fake a stomach ache, it works
I screamed, oww, my appendix feels like they could burst
Teacher, teacher, quick I need a naked nurse
"What's the matter"
I don't know, my leg, it hurts
"Leg? I thought you said it was your tummy"
Oh I mean it is, but I also got a bum knee
"Mr. Mathers, the fun and games are over
And just for that stunt, you're gonna get some extra homework"
But don't you wanna give me after school detention
"Nah, that bully wants to beat your ass and I'mma let him"

Brain damage
Ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was going
But everywhere I go they keep playing my song

Way before my baby daughter Hailie
I was harassed daily by this fat kid named D'Angelo Bailey
An eighth grader who acted obnoxious, cause his father boxes
So every day he'd shove me in the lockers
One day he came in the bathroom while I was pissing
And had me in the position to beat me into submission
He banged my head against the urinal till he broke my nose
Soaked my clothes in blood
Grabbed me and choked my throat
I tried to plead and tell him
We shouldn't beef
But he just wouldn't leave
He kept choking me and I couldn't breathe
He looked at me and said, "you gonna die, honky"
The principal walked in, and started helping him stomp me
I made them think they beat me to death
Holding my breath for like five minutes before they finally left
Then I got up and ran to the janitor's storage booth
Kicked the door hinge loose and ripped out the four inch screws
Grabbed some sharp objects, brooms and foreign tools
This is for every time you took my orange juice
Or stole my seat in the lunchroom and drank my chocolate milk
Every time you tipped my tray and it dropped and spilt
I'm gettin you back, bully, now once and for good
I cocked the broomstick back and swung hard as I could
And beat him over the head with it til I broke the wood
Knocked him down
Stood on his chest with one foot
Made it home, later that same day
Started reading a comic and suddenly everything became gray
I couldn't even see what I was trying to read
I went deaf and my left ear started to bleed
My mother started screaming, "what are you on, drugs"
Look at you, you're getting blood all over my rug (sorry)
She beat me over the head with the remote control
Opened a hole and my whole brain fell out of my skull
I picked it up and screamed
Look bitch, what have you done
Oh my God, I'm sorry son
Shut up you cunt
I said fuck it
Took it and stuck it back up in my head
Then I sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neck

Brain damage
Ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was going
But everywhere I go they keep playing my song

"Who can say for sure? Perhaps a frontal lobotomy would be the answer
If science could operate on this distorted brain and put it to good use
Society would reap a great benefit."

I walk around like a space cadet, place your bets
Who's likely to become a serial killer, case of Tourettes
Fuck, fuck-fuck, can't take the stress
I make a mess as the day progresses
Angry and take it out on the neighbors hedges
Like this is how I'll cut your face up bitches
With these hedge trimming scissors with razor edges
Imagination's dangerous, it's
The only way to escape this mess and make the best of this situation I guess
Cause I feel like a little bitch, this predicament's
Despicable, I'm sick of just gettin' pushed, it's ridiculous
I look like a freakin' wuss, a pussy, this kid just took
My stick of licorice and threw my sticker books in a picker bush
I wanna kick his tush, but I was six and shook
This fucker was twelve and was six foot, with a vicious hook
He hit me, I fell; I got back up, all I did was book
Now there's using your head
Momma always said

If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous - a brain, you'd be dangerous
I'ma prove you wrong
Momma, I'mma grow one day to be famous, and I'mma be a pain in the anus
I'ma be the bomb
I'ma use my head as a weapon, find a way to escape this insaneness
Momma always said, "Son, if you had a brain, you'd be dangerous"
Guess it pays to be brainless

Fast forward some years later, a teenager; this is fun, sweet
I just got jumped twice in one week, it's complete
It's usually once a month, this is some feat
I've accomplished, they've stomped me into the mud, gee for what reason, you stumped me
But how do you get the shit beat out of you, beat down and be upbeat when you don't have nothing?
No valid shot at life, chance to make it or succeed
Cause you're doomed from the start, it's like you grew up on Jump Street, from jump street
But if I could just get my head out my ass
I could accomplish any task
Practicing trash talkin'
In a trance locked in my room, yeah, but I got some plans, Momma
These damn rhymes are falling out of my pants pocket, I can't stop it
And I'm starting to blend in more
In school this shit helps for sure
I'm getting more self-assured than I've ever been before
Plus no one picks on me anymore, I done put a stop to that, threw my first punch - end of story
Still in my skull’s a vacant empty void been usin’ it more as a bin for storage, take some inventory
In this gourde there’s a Ford engine, door hinge, syringe, an orange An extension cord and a Ninja sword
Not to mention four linchpins, an astringent stored
Ironin’ board a bench, a wrench, a ore, wench an attention whore
Everything but a brain, but dome's off the fuckin' chain like an independent store
Something's wrong with my head
Just think if I had a brain in it, thank God that I don't, cause I'd probably be Dahmer, cause Momma always said

If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous - a brain, you'd be dangerous
I'ma prove you wrong
Momma, I'mma grow one day to be famous, and I'mma be a pain in the anus
I'ma be the bomb
I'ma use my head as a weapon, find a way to escape this insaneness
Momma always said, "Son, if you had a brain, you'd be dangerous"
Guess it pays to be brainless

Now my Mom goes wahm-wahm-wahm
Cause I'm not that smart, but I'm not dumb
I was on a bottom of the pile getting stomped
But somehow, I came out on top

I told you one day, I said they'd have that red carpet rolled out, yo
I'm nice, yo, fuck it, I'm out cold
Now everywhere I go they scream out go, I'm 'bout to clean house, yo
I'm Lysol, now I'm just household
Outsold the sell-outs, freak the hell out Middle America, hear 'em yell out in terror they were so scared and those kids
Just about, belted out whatever spouted or fell out of my smart aleck mouth, it was so weird
Inappropriate, so be it, I don't see it
Maybe one day when the smoke clears, it won't be as
Mothafucking difficult, ch-yeah, 'til then, hopefully ya
Little homos get over your fears and phobias
It's okay to be scared straight, they said I provoke queers
'Til emotions evoke tears, my whole career's
A stroke of sheer genius, smoke and mirrors, tactical, practical jokes, yeah
You mothafuckin' (insert insult here)
Who the fuck would've thunk that one little ole MC'd
Be able to take the whole culture and re-upholstery it?
And boy, they did flock; can't believe this little hick locked
This hip-hop shit in his hip pocket and still the shit got
That white trash traffic in gridlock, shit hopping like six blocks
From a Kid Rock, Insane Clown Posse Concert in mid Oc-
-Tober, and God forbid I see a wizard and get a brain in my titanium cranium y'all, cause
I'll turn into the Unabomber, Momma always said

I'ma prove you wrong
Momma, I'mma grow one day to be famous, and I'mma be a pain in the anus
I'ma be the bomb
I'ma use my head as a weapon, find a way to escape this insaneness

Insaneness ain't even a word, you stupid fuck
Neither is ain't[Pre-Recorded Message]

I swear to God, I come up there and pop all you fucking sluts
I told you Brenda, don't be fuckin' round on me
You fuckin' bitch! I told you!
"Aw, I don't do it, I don't do it!"
You motherfucking slut, I'll kill you, bitch!
I break your motherfucking neck
(You getting mad at me, I'm not Brenda)
Yo, don't play games with me, girl!
Don't play ga- When you come home tonight
I swear to God, yo, all of your shit will be outside!
You hear me girl?! I ain't playing with you no more!
I bought you everythi- "I saw yoooou, walking in the way"
You know what I'm saying, girl?!
I don't play that shit! (Crack kills, you know)
I don't play that shit, crack?! (Crack kills)
I ain't in no crack, bitch, this Slim motherfucking Shady
You understand me? Slim *chka-chka* Hi, my name is!
Bitch, you don't play with me, when yo-
When you come home tonight, girl
Your shit is all out on the motherfucking lawn
That's my word, is bond, yo!
(You live in a-You live in a house?)
(You sound like you live in the projects)
My word is bond, when you come home, girl
You last now, girl, you motherfucking slut
I know you fucking him, girl, I know you fucking him
You know what I'm saying?

I know you fucking him
I know you fucking him
I know you-Broke the rubber
Busted a nut up in your mother
So how do you feel about having another little brother
Nasty motherupper
Talking trash like a trucker
Snatch your bitch up out of your track
Smacked her up and fucked her
Always talking shit high
Smoking chocolate Thai
You all can die
Just by walking by giving an awkward eye
I've lost my motherfreaking marbles
Smelling like a brewery
Jewelling at the way your jewellery sparkles
Head full of charcoals
Smoked out brain particles
Burning holes in clothes articles
A retarded fool since I started school
Burned the weed before I learned to read
Disregarded rules
Skipping classes to blaze the blunt ashes
Kissing front dashes and smashing up cars like stunt crashes
Hall passes for restrooms
Chewing mushrooms
Doing rush fumes in the lunch room
Looking nervous
Liquor in my thermos
Hung with hermits that carry guns without permits
Staring at the bitch with firm tits
Jacking off
Aiming straight for both lips when my sperm spits[20 seconds of background noise]
"It fits, perfect"

Better watch out, sucka, now I got ya where I want ya
Onslaught, coming and I'm packing in my lunch up
Bunch of, missile launchers and a bunch of contra-
-band, van full of ganja, now come on jump
Man stop, moshing Marshall, oh my god ya
Doing the cha-cha and the cucaracha with a quadra-
-plegic, boogieing down to Frank Sinatra
Lindsay to the Lohan naked while you let me watch ya
Who'da knew the Buddha do to me what it's done
Such cynicism when this isn't in my system
Blunt hypnotism, lift the spliff up to my lips son
So much on my hands I got to give my kids a fist bump
Christo-pher Reeves swimming in my swim trunks
"Mister, help me" is what he said to me and then sunk
Women skinning and then cutting them up in chunks
In comes the woman with cocoa butter skin once

Once again they call me Buffalo Bill
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill
Skin 'em up, hem 'em, sew 'em up in those kilts
Up in those kilts, uppa-up in those kilts
Man you don't want to go up in those hills
Up in those hills, uppa-up in those hills
You better beware, stay clear of Buffalo Bill
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill

Always, you can see him lurking in the hallways
Carcasses of Caucasian females in his crawl space
How the hell did he fit 'em all into such a small place
Hide 'em in the wall, well how long will the drywall take?
Well fuck it then, I got nothing but time, I'll wait
Until it dries for the moment I guess you're all safe
After I sand it and buff it, I guess that I'll paint
My chainsaw's out of gas, my regular saw ain't
Now here I come again, damn stomach rumbling
You can even hear the evil spirits coming from within
Someone's in, the back of my damn house rummaging
It's a girl, she looks pretty thin, but I want to skin
Been, on the hunt again; when, will it ever end?
Evelyn, why you tryna fight? You will never win
Severing, legs, arms, damn there goes another limb
Pull the lever then, trapdoor, death is evident


Now what you know about Buffalo Bill? Nothing, so chill
Fucking whore, you better fucking hold still
Make sure none of that lotion in the bucket don't spill
Cut 'em, gut 'em and just keep to stuffing those girls
Man I think she had enough of those pills
Sedate her then I'll wait, I'll come back later just to clutch on those steel
Blades, baby when I cut ya don't squeal
I hate the loud noises, I fucking told you!
I keep hearing voices like wouldn't ya like to go and get your butcher knife
And push it right through her while you put ya shish-kabob skewers
Into her, barbecue her or would you do to her
What you usually do to a girl who's skin's newer?
"In a world of sin you are, this is turning into a
Torment tournament of sorts, Christmas ornament you are!"
I'll be sure to Ginsu ya, 'til there's no more skin to ya, boo-yah
Who ya think you're fucking with, duck because here he comes again

Yo, check it out, it's fucked up, and I don't see either one of us budging

"I'm withholding my anger
Though I'd like to be the strangler
Of this punk ass little pussy's puny neck
It's my right to insist
That he acknowledge my existence
But he just displays complete lack of respect"
That's what he says to himself
As he use his magazines to trash me
As he sits with both his feet up at his desk
Smokes a bag of his weed
And starts imagining things
And he just can't see that he's manically depressed
And in his jealousy and envy
It just whirls him in a frenzy
As he turns on MTV and sees my face
He don't exist in this world
So he just twists and he twirls
Spirals and spins till he hurls himself into rage
And it's destroying him slowly
Cause he does not even know me
Even though he sees me everywhere he goes
So he just tortures himself
He has no fortune and wealth
So he extorts someone else to get his dough
And now he's acting like a bully
So he tries to push and pull me
But he knows that he can't fool me so he's mad
He has no choice but to scream
And raise his voice up at me
Cause it annoys him to see that I ain't scared

You ain't no motherfucking (bully)
And I ain't bowing to no motherfucking (bully)
I won't allow it, ain't gonna cower to no (bully)
I'll be damned if I don't stand up to a (bully)
Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a (bully...)
And I know it must be fucking with you emotionall(y...)

Now I'm not trying to make no more enemies
No more unfortunately
There's so many other motherfuckers that just are
They just keep hounding at me
Now that I'm down with 50
Suddenly now I got beef with this faggot Ja [laughter]
But his ass is such a puppet
Irv could shove his whole hand up it
And just make him say what he wants him to say
But Suge has Irv's on a string
And Irv's so nervous that he
Says anything to this man to keep him at bay
So now Ja thinks that he's so tough
And Murder Inc.'s the big bad wolf
And they go huff and puff and blow our label down
But our building's made out of bricks
So you ain't taking out shit
And dog you just did a song with Bobby Brown
So now you try to pull a race card
And it backfires in your face hard
Cause you know we don't play that black and white shit
Plus this stylist that you fucked
When you was ecstasied up
Was just a man who's dressed up as a white bitch

You must be taking to much (E...)

Now what bothers me the most
About hip-hop is we so close
To picking up where we left off with Big and Pac
We just lost Jam Master J
Big L got blasted away
Plus we lost Bugs, Slang Ton, and Freaky Ta
It's like a never-ending cycle
That just seems to come full circle
Everybody's gotta be so fucking hard
I'm not excluding myself
Cause I been stupid as well
I been known to lose it when someone says something smart
But as we grow as men
We learn to let shit go, but then again
There's only so much bullshit we can really stand
We all got reps to uphold
When someone steps on our toes
It's no exception, it goes for every man
But if Irv really gave a fuck
About Ja like he claims he does
He'd wake him up and make his boy get off them drugs
But he just keeps feeding him pills
So if that E doesn't kill him
Someone from G-Unit will and I ain't buzzed
Dawg, I'm talking to you straight
If the situation escalates
Any worse, we're gonna lose another soldier to this game
And if I get killed for this rap
I got a million in cash
That says I will get you back in Hailie's name

Irvine, get your boy off that (E...)

Get at me, dog
Holla[Eminem]
Here we go again

Does it make you mad when I switch my flow
You can't understand how I get my dough
50 Cent, I'm on fire cause Shady said so
I'm on Fire

Everybody's in a rush try to get the throne
I just get on the track and try to set the tone
I ain't trying to use nobody as a steppin' stone
But don't compare me, I'm better off just left alone
And I ain't even trying to go there with record sales
I'm just trying to keep it humble and respect myself
Say what up, keep stepping, and just rep D12
Keep my nose clean, stay away from weapons, jail
And living reckless
But if you go check my belt
You may see something else I used to protect myself
A vest, to stop a Rueger and deflect the shells
And send 'em back at you faster than they left the barrel
And I don't even carry guns no more, I don't got to
Got undercover cops that'll legally pop you
And I done seen a lot of people cross the line
But this motherfucker Ja must have lost his mind
That X, got him thinkin' he was DMX
Then he switched to 'Pac now he's tryna be him next
So which one are you? X, Luther, Pac or Michael
Just keep singin' the same song, recycled
We'd all much rather get along than fight you
Me and Hailie danced to your songs, we liked you
And you don't really wanna step inside no mic booth
C'mon now, you know the white boy'll bite you
I hurt your pride dawg and you know I don't like to
But I will if I have to, with syllable after syllable I just slap you
Killin' you fasta than you poppin' pill after little pill of them tabs of that shit you on
But if you want it you got it you'd bump this shit too, if we ain't diss you on it
But if we lock horns we can charge harder than Busta
We bump heads wit any motherfucker that wants to
So whats the, deal where was all the tough talk?
When I walked up to you like, Ja what up dawg?
How come you didn't say you had a problem then?
When you was standin' there wit all your men, we coulda solved this then
I'mma grown man dawg come holla
All you did was slap hands, smile and swallow
Another one of them little X pills in front of me
And tell me 50 Cent was everything you wanna be come on

I know you don't want it with me, you know you don't want it with me
You, talk an', soon you gon' see, you don't wanna bump heads with me
I know you don't want it with me, tou, talk an' you soon you will see
You know you don't want it with me

You couldn't son me if my father helped you
My punchlines is hot, my bars will melt you
Ja you Stuart Little, shells'll lift you
Every other week I'm buyin' a new pistol
I clap at your ass with this chrome 38
And put six thru your hats, a seven and 3/8's
Irv you ain't Suge Knight, you should shook night
I put my knife in ya wind pipe and breeze through the turnpike
You know and I know who took ya chain
You got robbed two times so ya ass is lame
I'm down to die for this shit all I need is bail
You better stick to the movies with Steven Segal, bitch


Fuck that, I'm miles away
And these industry niggas startin' to get outta hand
Like I won't find your whereabouts by stompin' 'em out ya man
We killin' New York, even in Compton they understand
I'm on the block where you was raised doin' chocolate up out your van and
They see me pop a boy for icey cause I could
But you been gone so long you probably forgot your way around the hood (hood)
Cause when you paranoid it's hard to make a song
How you want it wit' us, half of your artists got make-up on
Every magazine I own your on your knees takin' prayer pictures
And you ain't even got shot yet, you scared bitches
You don't know nothin' about what pain is sucka
I'll put your ass underground like a train conductor, muh'fucker


(Eminem)
Well I do pop pills, I keep my tube socks filled
Pop the same shit that got 2Pac killed
Spit game to these hoes, like a soap opera episode
And punch a bitch in the nose, til her whole face explodes
There's three things I hate: girls, women and bitches
Smack bitches that walk up, and drop-kick midgets
Call me Boogie Night, the stalker that walks awkward
Stick figure, with a dick bigger than Mark Wahlberg
Comin through the airport, sluggish, walkin on crutches
Hit a fuckin (*pregnant chick*) in her (*stomach*) with luggage
It's like a dream I can't snap out, I black out, and back out
Lookin for some other thug, to beat the crap out
I'm bringin you rap singers two middle fingers
I flip you off in French, then translate in English
Then I'ma vanish off the face of the planet and come back
Speakin so much Spanish, Pun can't even understand it

(Missy) Won't you busa rhyme for me boy .. Slim Shady
(Shady) Yeah
(Missy) Won't you busa rhyme for me boy .. Slim motherfuckin Shady
(Shady) Yeah
(Missy) Won't you busa rhyme for me boy .. Slim Shady
(Shady) Yeah
(Missy) Won't you busa rhyme for me boy ..

(Eminem)
I had a huge attitude, started off staticky
Mad at you, had you mad at me automatically (one more time)
I'm not a commodity, I'm an oddity
Who oddly enough developed himself a Halloween following
It's so big, if I counted up all the freaks who follow me
I'd probably owe Ozzy Osbourne an apology
College girls, live in an alcoholic's world
Full of earl, head twirls every time the toilet swirls *flush*
Covered in throw-up, and I refuse to grow up
I won't budge, I still tell a grown-up to shut up (SHUT UP!)
I made this rap game suspenseful, cause now I got a impulse
To give you insults wrote with a pencil (bitch)
And waste the paper on you, choppin down the oakwood
Cause everything that you wrote in your notebook was no good
And as long as I stay in the studio and keep cuttin
You motherfuckers are puttin your words together for nuttin

(Missy) Won't you busa rhyme for me boy .. Slim Shady
(Shady) What's the deal?
(Missy) Won't you busa rhyme for me boy .. Slim motherfuckin Shady
(Shady) Yeah.. who?
(Missy) Won't you busa rhyme for me boy .. Slim Shady
(Shady) What's the deal?
(Missy) Won't you busa rhyme for me boy ..

(Missy)
Turn the music up, we gon' wake the neighbors
We gon' get high, we gon' roll to Vegas
Me and Slim Shady, on some shit daily
What you want what you got is it hot? (Is it hot?)

Turn the music up, we gon' wake the neighbors
We gon' get high, we gon' roll to Vegas
Me and Slim Shady, on some shit daily
What you want (yo) what you want (yo) ahh uhh yo

"A person from another planet might disagree with you"
"Well if you want my opinion, it comes from right here on Earth"

(Eminem)
Slim Shady.. Misdemeanor..
Timbaland.. Slim Shady..
Misdemeanor..

I'm homicidal, and suicidal with no friends
Holdin a gun with no handle, just a barrel at both ends
Sprayin tecs at you until you see your fuckin legs
With the bullet holes and the exit wounds layin next to you
(AHH!) Fuckin mad dog, foamin at the mouth
Fuck mouth, my whole house, is foamin at the couch
Jumped out of the 93rd floor of a building
And shot every window out on the way down to the ground (KEEP FILMING!)
Woke up to a hospital staff, got up and laughed, chopped em in half
Suffocated the oxygen mask
Shit if I get any higher, I'ma get the East and West beefin again
Slide back to Detroit and stand in the crossfire

(Missy)
Y'all better call the police 'fore I kill this track
Don't shoot Missy!!! Get back
Uhh, I'ma put you all in the line
Uhh, and I'ma watch you MC's die
Yo mommy, mommy, Missy done lost her mind!
I think somebody done pissed her off this time!
Yo, I'ma have to bust you through your chest and
Uhh, you will have to clean up the mess (uh-huh)
It's rainin rainin and it's pourin loud
Never fear, cause pissy Missy's through the crowd
Uhh, I hear the gats go cha-pow
Who shot me damnit? Bitch get down
Don't walk when I talk, I never talk when I smile (uh-huh)
Lay em on down, like they lived underground (uh)
For the sound, that me and, Timbaland, we found
Get your ass, kicked later, or get your ass, kicked now

Uhh.. one-two
Misdemeanor, Slim Shady
Timbaland, motherfucker
Uhh uhh uhh
Cool, cool, cool
Triple zero[Intro] (beeping)


(Marshall ... Marshall!)

Bitches and gentlemen! It's SHOWTIME!
Hurry hurry, step right up!
Introducin the star of our show.. his name is
(Marshall!)
You wouldn't want to be anywhere else in the world right now
So without further ado, I bring to you
(Marshall!)

You bout to witness, hip-hop in its most purest
Most rawest form, flow almost flawless
Most hardest, most honest known artist
Chip off the old block, but old Doc is back
Looks like Batman brought his own Robin
Oh God, Saddam's got his own Laden
With his own private plane, his own pilot
Set to blow college dorm rooms doors off the hinges
Oranges, peach, pears, plums, syringes
{*chainsaw sound*} VRINN VRINN Yeah, here I come
I'm inches, away from you, dear fear none
Hip-hop is in a state of 9-1-1 so

Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (HELL YEAH!)

Quick gotta move fast, gotta perform miracles
Gee wilikers Dre, "Holy bat syllables!"
Look at all the bullshit that goes on in Gotham when I'm gone
Time to get rid of these rap criminals
So skip to your lou while I do what I do best
You ain't even impressed no more; you're used to it
Flows too wet, nobody close to it
Nobody says it but still everybody knows the shit
The most hated on out of all those who say they get hated on
In eighty songs and exaggerate it all so much
They make it all up, there's no such thing
Like a female with good looks who cooks and cleans
It just means so much more to so much more
People when you're rappin and you know what for
The show must go on; so I'd like to welcome y'all
To Marshall and Andre's carnival
C'mon! Now..


It's just like old times, the Dynamic Duo
Two old friends, why panic? You already know
Who's fully capable, the two caped heroes
Dial straight down the center, eight-zero-zero
You can even call collect, the most feared duet
Since me and Elton, played career Russian Roulette
And never even see me blink or get to bustin a sweat
People steppin over people just to rush to the set
Just to get to see an MC who breathes so freely
Ease over these beats and be so breezy
Jesus how can shit be so easy?
How can one Chandra be so Levy?
Turn on these beats, MC's don't see me
Believe me; BET and MTV
Are gonna grieve when we leave dog, fo' sheezy
Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me
'til we grow beards, get weird and disappear
Into the mountains - nothin but clowns down here
But we, ain't fuckin around round here
Yo Dre (whattup?) Can I get a "hell yeah"? (HELL YEAH!) Now


So there you have it folks (Marshall!) has come to save the day
Back with his friend Andre, here to remind you that bullshit does not pay
Because (Marshall!) and Andre are here to stay
And never go away, until our dying day
Until we're old and grey (Marshall!)
So until next time friends, same blonde hair, same rap channel
Good night everyone, thank you for coming
Your host for the evening (Marshall!)
Oh! Heh[Intro]
(I, I wanna grow up too)
"Uncle Marshall, will you tell us a bedtime story?"
Here we go:

Now, once upon a time not long ago
There was a little rapper about to blow
But his album came, and it was not good
I think it went lead or double copper-wood
So these silly little fans, they were misled
By a nerdy internet computer hip-hop head
"Me and you, Clef, we're gonna make some cash
Grab this silver paint and just paint my ass"
Hey mister, would you care to bear witness to
The ass-whippin I'm about to administer
To this ass-kissin little vaginal blister?
Stanibus: little Marshall Mathers' sister
And in this corner, we have the "Mr
Not-Havin'-It," it's the Mad, sinister
Dr. Evil, with his bag of tricks for
This little antagonistic faggot
Dick-sucking ex-LL Cool J fan from Windsor
I'm 'bout to murder little Kenny-Fag-Kaniff-sta
You bastard, I ain't wanna have to diss ya
Canibus, where the fuck you at? I miss ya!

Canibitch, oh, Canibitch
Wherefore art thou, Canibitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with

Canibitch, oh, Canibitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York, or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh, Canibitch

Now, at first, I ain't really understand this shit
Picture me, for a second, and imagine it:
Chillin' in the Bat Mansion relaxin'
When all a sudden some bullshit comes across the scanners, it's
Canibitch, on some 'Stan Lives' shit
It creeped me out at first; man, this is sick
But me, bein' just as sick, this conflict
Gets my dick harder than arithmetic
And I know how you jealous ones envy
I shoulda knew better from the first few letters you sent me
The first two letters, you were tellin' me shit like
You respect me, like any other regular MC
The third letter, you asked how come I ain't return
None of the messages at Shady Records you left me?
The fourth letter: "Slim you're really startin' to upset me"
The fifth letter told me you were comin' to get me
The sixth letter, there's a bomb threat on our building
This crazy motherfucker's really tryin' to kill me
So I went back and read the first few letters that said
Some shit about a message you left
Oh shit! That's not a E, that's an A!
This dude wants to leave me a 'massage,' he's gay!
Right away, I'm on the phone with Dr. Dre:
"We got a bogey," "Marshall, I'm on the way"


So, in two seconds flat, Dre's at my crib
Only thing is, we both know where this kid lives
And neither one of us have Canadian citizenship
"Shit. Oh Dre, wait a minute, that's it!
All we gotta do is use a bit of turbo-boost
We can fly over the border!" "Let's Go!" [whoosh]
"What was that? Oh, Jermaine Dupri
Fuck it," Keep goin', no time to waste
"Wait, back up. Hit him one more time, in case
"Okay," Fuck, now he's draggin' under the car
Oh well, Only thirty more thousand miles!"
Meanwhile, me and Dre are tryin' to conversate
Just tryin' to find a reason for the constant hate
And tryin' to figure out what happened to 'Germaine Propane'
"He couldn't have fell off that hard." Ain't no way!
What happened to the way you was rappin' when you was scandalous?
That Canibus turned into a television evangelist!
Plus, he raps with his regular voice [four impacts]
"What was that?" "Pet Shop Boys."
So, we pull up to the bridge where he last was spotted
His corpse was still movin', but his ass was rotted
And he kinda smelled a little like Courtney Love
I figured if I stick him with a fork, he's done
So I stabbed him twice. Kept jabbin', Christ!
He won't die! This guy's like a battered wife!
He's like Kim: he keeps comin' back for more
But he won't fight back. I cracked his jaw
Hold up! 'Bis, quit foldin' up!
Punch me in the chest, make my shoulders touch
Do something! At least one punchline!
Come on! Till the meter reads Nine! Nine! Nine-
Ty nine percent of my fans are blond!
'Bis, come on, answer me, man, respond!
Tell me 'bout the sun, rain, moon and stars!
Intergalactical metaphors from Mars!
Raw to the floor, raw like Reservoir Dogs!
Bite another line from Redman's song!
Suddenly, the stub of a dead man's arm
From a midget reaches out from under the car
It's J.D.! This motherfucker won't die, neither!
Dre starts sprayin' him with cans of ether
We swamped the bitch in it; stomped the bitch again
"Compton!" "Detroit, bitch, talk some shit again!
Stomp him!" "Switch feet!" "Stomp him!" "Switch again!"
"Dre, all right, he's dead, dog, quit kickin' him!
I think Stanibus jumped off the bridge again!" ("Ahh!")
"Damn," "He disappeared, yo, he's gone, he did it again!"

"Breaking news, Detroit rapper Eminem cancels his sold-out European tour
To check himself into rehab, after admitting an addiction to sleep medication
We'll have more on this story as it develops"
"Shady Records recording artist Obie Trice has apparently
Survived a gunshot to the head, in what appears to be a random drive-by shooting
Meanwhile, Eminem is rumored to be alienated... on again/off again relationship with..."
"This just in, a tour bus involving Eminem's bus..."
"Updating a story we brought you earlier about gunfire at an after-hours
Club we've learned that the rapper Proof has been fatally shot."
"Shady/Aftermath recording artist..."
"Long-time best friend of Eminem, and a member of the rap group D12."
"D12 back in the news again today..."
"Is it a sabbatical or the end? The rumors and speculation
Continue to swirl around Eminem. He insists he's just taking a break
But doubters believe he's retiring, leaving us all to ask
'Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?'"

So this is it, this is what I wished for
Just isn't how I envisioned it, fame to the point of imprisonment
I just thought the shit'd be different
But something changed the minute that I got a whiff of it
I started to inhale it, smell it, started sniffing it
And it became my cocaine, I just couldn't quit
I just wanted a little bit then it turned me to a monster
I became a hypocrite, concert after concert
I was raking in the dough, rolling in green
Had the game hemmed up, like a sewing machine
But I was losing my freedom, there was nowhere for me
To not go and be seen, and just go and be me
And there was no in-between, you either loved it or hate it
Every CD critics gave it a 3 then three
Years later they go back and re-rate it
Then called the Slim Shady LP the greatest
The Marshall Mathers was a classic, the Eminem Show was fantastic
But Encore just didn't have the caliber to match it
I guess enough time just ain't passed yet
A couple more years that shit'll be Illmatic
And eight years later I'm still at it
Divorced, re-married, a felon, a father, sleeping pill addict
And this is real talk, I feel like The Incredible Hulk
My back has been broke and I can still walk

So be careful what you wish for, cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might not know what to do with it
Cause it might just come back on you ten-fold
I said be careful what you wish for, cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might not know what to do with it
Cause it might just come back on you ten-fold

I got a letter from a fan that said, he's been praying for me
Every day and for some reason it's been weighing on my mind heavy
Cause I don't read every, letter I get
But something told me to go ahead and open it
But, why would someone pray for you when they don't know you?
You didn't pray for me when I was local
And as I lay these vocals, I think of all the shit I had to go through
Just to get to where I'm at, I've already told you
At least, a thousand times in these rhymes
I appreciate the prayer but I've already got, God on my side
And it's been one hell of a ride, hasn't it?
Just watching it from a opposite standpoint, man boy's got to look
Nuts, and that's the only word I can think of
Right now on how, to describe the shit
This is like a vibe you get, go ahead and bop to it
Just watch what you wish for cause I got the shit

Your style is generic, mine's authentic made
I roll like a renegade, you need clinic aid
My techniques bizzare and ill, I scar and kill
You were a star until I served you like a bar and grill
Now I proceed to cook and grill ya, that's all it took to kill ya
You better recognize me like I look familiar
You wanna battle?
You beat around the bush like you scared to lick pussy, so you eat around the tush
I need a clown to push, someone that I can bully
Wait a minute - I don't think you understand fully
See, me without a style is like mustard without the Heinz
I lead the new school, you're a Busta without the Rhymes
I'll crush the shit out your lines

Now I'm the Rashiki smoking the lick licky
Ten freaky girls inside The Chin Tiki
Girl, when you see me you better believe me
This ain't a game and pimping ain't easy
Anything goes when it comes to hoes
I'm the kingpin when it comes to flows
You better ask someone if you don't know
When you see me girl, say what up doe
Ten freaky girls, ten, ten, ten freaky girls[Intro]
You know, technically, I'm not even really supposed to be here right now. So fuck it, might as well make the most of it... Feels good. Guess I'm lucky. Some of us don't get a second chance. But I ain't blowing this one. Nah, man. Shit, I feel like I can do anything now

Who can catch lightning in the bottle, set fire to water?
Coming out the nozzle on the fire hose, flyer than swatters
(Cinderella man, Cinderella man
Cinderella man, Cinderella man)
Smash an hourglass, grab the sand, take his hands and cup 'em
Spit a rhyme and freeze the clock, take the hands of time and cuff 'em
(Cinderella man, Cinderella man
Cinderella man, Cinderella man)

There's a storm coming that the weatherman couldn't predict
I start the bug, prick you better, flee cause I get ticked
It's a wrap, I was down, when I was down, I was kicked, I got up
I'm back to punch you to the ground, you trick, it's a trap
Fuck my last CD, the shit's in my trash
I'll be god damned if another rapper gets in my ass
I hit the gas and I spit every rap as if it's my last
You can die in the blink of an eye
So bat your eyelashes, and keep winking and blowing kisses
Cause you're flirting with death
I'm destroying your livelihood, I ain't just hurting your rep
I catch a flow and get going, no remorse I'm showing
Ain't slowing for no one
Knowing there is nothing you can do about it
Zero in on the target like a marksman, the target is you
I shut your lane down, took your spot, parked in it too
Arsenic flow, lighter fluid saliva: what can you do?
Go get your crew to hype you up stand behind you like "whoooo!"
That boy's hot enough to melt Hell, burn Satan too
Fry his ass and put his ashes back together with glue
See you can hate em, he don't blame you frankly he would too
This game could ill afford to lose him, how 'bout you? Now guess who?

Here's a clue
He came to a ball in a wife beater lost his Nike shoe
It's in your ass, he's in your ass, he's all up in your psyche too
Now what's his name? Cinderella man, Cinderella man
If I had a time machine, I'd be Cinderella man
Music is my time machine so call me (Cinderella man, Cinderella man)

Fuck catching lightning, he struck it, screamed "Shut up" at thunder
Flipped the world upside down and made it rain upward
(Cinderella man, Cinderella man)
Rewound the future to the present, paused it – don't ask how
Fuck the past, mothafucka, he's the shit right now
(Cinderella man, Cinderella man)

Cinderella man, Cinder Fellow, Shady dane
Came to wrap the game up in cellophane, raise hell, from Hell he came
But didn't come to bore you with the Cinderella story
Nor did he come to do the same, can't afford to be a lame-o
In this day and age and at this stage of the game
Mediocrity can no longer be allowed to fly
So say "bye" to the old, "H-I" to the new que sera
Consider it his last hurrah, the coup de grâce
Raise 'em high in the sky, keep 'em up, time to bring the place alive
Thanks for being patient, I will make no more mistakes
Shit, my potato's baked, homie, the veggies on my plate can fly
My filet is smoking weed, yeah, faggot, the steaks are high
Shit I ain't even suppose to be here
By the grace of God, the skin on my teeth
And the hair on my nuts, I skated by
Now y'all are on thin ice with ankle weights I hate to lie
How fucking irritated are you? How much in your face am I?
It ain't shit you could do but fear it
Proof is here in spirit, I'm the spitting image
I'll mirror it when I stand near it, your pussy lyric: I "cunt" hear it
Who forms pyramids and raps circles around square lyricists, who?

Where's my snare, I have no snare in my headphones
There you go

Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have; I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick as the mind of the motherfuckin' kid that's behind
All this commotion. emotions run deep as oceans explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the mornin' and takin' names in the evenin'
Leave 'em with the taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
See they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now; I bet ya probably sick of me now ain't you momma?
I'ma make you look so ridiculous now

I'm sorry momma
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleanin' out my closet (one more time)
I said I'm sorry momma
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleanin' out my closet

Ha! I got some skeletons in my closet
And I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'mma expose it; I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin' CD
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch
Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No I don't on second thought I just fuckin' wished he would die
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
Even if I hated Kim, I grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake
I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face them today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun
Cause I'da killed him; shit I woulda shot Kim and him both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show


Now I would never diss my own momma just to get recognition
Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position; just try to envision
Witnessin' your momma poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housing systems, victim of Münchausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya stomach
Doesn't it? Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, Ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, Ma?
But guess what? You're gettin' older now and it's cold when you're lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick he's gonna know that you're phony
And Hailie's gettin' so big now; you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her - she won't even be at your funeral
See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch do your song - keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get
You selfish bitch; I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me
Well guess what, I am dead - dead to you as can be!

Where's my snare, I have no snare in my headphones
There you go

Yeah. (Oh)
This game is like cocaine. (I want this more than anything in the world)
Haha... So do I... at least I thought I did
(Got to have it, yeah I need it, I'm addicted, yeah I'm fading fading)

This is a beat with no words at first, it’s a blank painting
Exercising the mind, it’s brain strength training
It starts off something like, "Shady's an insane maniac
Yeah, Slim Shady, that's a zany name, ain't it?"
Now all you need's an image to go with the name, baby
Wifebeaters and white t-shirts, Hanes mainly
It's a long shot, but is it possible? There's a lane, maybe
If not he's gon' have to come and change the whole game, ain't he?
He wants the fame so bad he can taste it, he can see his name up in lights
Women screaming his fucking name, fainting
Shady did it, he sold out the whole dang stadium
Joe Shmoe made it, he took his Plain Jane lady
And his baby Hailie out the trailer but he ain't trailing anymore
He's ahead of the race, while maintaining his innocence
Little does he know his train is derailing
And he's about to be raped by this game anally, now

What would you do for a little bit?
What would you give for a little bit of that C-O-C-A-I-N-E?
I got to have it, yeah I made it, I'm addicted, yeah I'm fading
(Cause once you cave in, you don't want to leave)

You’re operating on all cylinders, syllables spit like dillingers
Spilling your guts, people are feeling your mic skills
But these haters are ice grilling ya
Willing to sacrifice anything for the life that they might steal from ya
Fake friends will kill for ya, die for ya but you can’t decipher
Why for the life of ya, it wasn’t like this when you were cyphering
Argue with your wife again, she found Vicodin
In your pants last night again, your dispute's public
Nothing is private anymore, oh, and your best friend?
Say bye-bye to him, what kind of apple you take a bite of Slim?
(But this is what you wanted Marshall, ain't it?) Fuck no!
The way that it turned out was nothin' like the picture that I painted
In my head, sometimes a dream and making it's more fun
Than it's to actually make it, the game stripped me naked
It robbed me of ever having another real relationship
With another girl, this world is a fucking trip
As I slip in another world, proceed, take another hit
Sniff 'til I fucking hurl, tell 'em all to fucking sit
And spin 'til they fucking twirl, middle finger up again
Relapsing back in this game, oh well, fuck it then, now


You start off bright, just to see your name in lights
Just so you can live the life
You take a bite and lose your sight, they call this (fame)
You think you're good, just cause you got out the hood
Concerned only with getting dough, no longer poor
But you lost your soul, they call it (fame)
I hear it callin', my name is callin'
Why you struggling when you could be ballin'?
My head is saying yes but my feet is stallin'
So many walkin' by the end they fallin'
But I gots to have it, like Eve and the apple
She had to grab it, I got to take it, I got to make it
That's the plan and I can't forsake it, yeah

(dialing tone)
Oh, answer the phone you fucking slut transvestite
With a cock, you're a man, aren't you?
You're a fucking man
(Hello?) Oh, hey
Um, is this, uh, I'm looking for a sensual, I don't know
Bodyrub, or something (Uh-huh, that's what I do)
Listen, what type of bodyrubs, like
I'm looking for like, um, I don't know, like
A cock massage... You know what I mean? (Right)
Like something like, I'm kind of, like
I don't know, I'm sure you do this everyday
Um... I'm just- I don't know, I'm looking for something like
My wife, my wi- I'm married, um
My wife does not satisfy me the way that you could[Intro]
Cause some things just, don't change
It's better when they stay the same
Although the whole world, knows your name
So on a, bigger stage
They came to see you spit your game
So it shouldn't be difficult, to explain
Just why you came back again
You hate the fame, love the game
Cold as ice, you remain
Fuck them all, tell them all eat shit, here we go again

Goddamn
Is it that time again already?
Haha, you don’t look too happy to see me
Fuck man, don’t everybody welcome me back at once
All right, just fuck ya’ll then

You can get the dick, just call me the ball sack, I'm nuts
Michael Vick in this bitch, dog, fall back you mutts
Fuck your worms, you've never seen such a sick puppy
Fuck it a sick duck, I want my duck sicked mommy
And my nuts licked, gobble them up trick, yummy
Bitch, you don't fuckin' think I know that you suck dick, dummy?
You'll get your butt kicked, fuck all that love shit honey
Yeah, I laugh when I call you a slut, it's funny
Shorty dance while I diss you to the beat, fuck the words
You don't listen to 'em anyway, yeah, struck a nerve, sucker
Motherfucka, might as well let my lips pucker
Like Elton John, cause I'm just a mean cocksucker
The shit is on cause you went and pissed me off
Now I'm shittin' and pissin' on everybody give a fuck if it's right or wrong
So put the Buddah light a bong
But take a look at Mariah, next time I inspire you to write a song, come on

Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
I'm as cold as the cold wind, blows
When it snows and it's twenty-below
Ask me why man, I just don't, know
Know-know-know, know-know, know
I'm as cold as the cold wind, blows
Blow-blow-blows, blow-blow, blows
Oh, oh-oh-oh

Fuck it I'm a loose cannon, Bruce Banner's back in the booth
Y'all are sitting ducks, I'm the only goose standin'
I'll set the world on fire, piss on it put it out
Stick my dick in a circle, but I'm not fuckin' around, mothafucka
I'll show you pussyfootin', I'll kick a bitch in the cunt
'til it makes a queef and sounds like a fuckin' whoopee cushion
Who the fuck is you pushing? You musta mistook me
For some sissy soft punk lookin' for some nookie or bosom
Go ahead fuckin' hater, push me
I'll told you ain't no fucking way to shush me
Call me a faggot cause I hate a pussy
Man the fuck up, sissy
G's up all you gardeners freeze up, put your hoes down
“Shady ease up, man, chill”
Naw, I can't goddamn it, rap is a landfill
Drop the anvil, these are shoes that you can't fill
Shit the day that happens the world will stop spinnin'
And Michael J. Fox'll come to a standstill
During a earthquake, urine in your face, cause you're fake
"Ah! What the fuck? That hurt! Wait
Ah what the fuck! I just got struck by lightning"
All right then I quit, God, I give up
Call it "Evil That Men Do"
Lord forgive me for what my pen do
“This is for your sins, I cleanse you, you can repent
But I warn you, if you continue to hell I send you”
And just then the wind blew and I said


How long will I be this way? Shady until my dyin' day
'til I hang up the mic and it's time for me to say... so long
'til then I'll drop the fuckin' bombs
Like I missed the pass when I went long
If you don't like it you can kiss my ass in a lint thong
Now sing along, slut this, slut that, learn the words to the song!
"Oh, bitches don't like that" Homie, I'll be nicer to women
When Aquaman drowns and the Human Torch starts swimming
Man I'm a cold soul, I roll solo
So don't compare me to the other bums over there
It's like apples to oranges, peaches to plums yeah
I'm bananas pussy, cut off the grapes and grow a pair
But I swear you try to diss me I'll slaughter you
I put that on everything, like everyone does with Auto-tune
The last thing you want to do, is have me spit out a rhyme
And say "I was writing this and I thought of you," so


I don't know, I don't know, what caused
I don't know what caused me to be this way
I don't know, I don't know but I'll, probably be this way 'til my dying day
I don't know why I'm so, I'm so cold, mean things I don't mean to say
I guess this is how you made meGood mornin'!
Haha, wake your mother fuckin' asses up!
Yo what is the what?
Well come on then, you know what time it is!
Stop sleepin' on my roof bitch!

For whatever it's worth it's worth me havin my ass whipped
Cause I'mma have the last lift that ever gets ass squished
I just can't get past these little pissants
That wanna be rauny bad asses so bad
And they so mad they can't stand it
Cause we can and they can't spit (Haawk)
And they can't handle it like a man
And that's when it just happens
And I snap and it's a wrap, and it's a scrap an then it isn't rap is it?
Hip-Hop isn't a sport anymore when you got to go and resort back into that shit
Maybe I'm old fashioned but my passion
Is to smash anyone rappin without havin a slappin
Believe me I'd much rather pick up a pencil than a pistol but I'm pissed now
But it all depends on just how far it get's took on the mic
Cause I'm tellin you right now your not gonna like it
Cause if I get pushed over the edge then I'm pullin you with me
You poke a stick at a pit bull you get bit B
These words stick to you like crazy glue
When you diss me cause they just bounce off me like bullets through fifty!
I'm the beatiful-est thing and your gonna miss me when I'm gone
Like Kieth Murray when he threw a stool and hit a girl acci-dently (argghhh!!)
I do this for Swifty, Kon and Kuniva, Bizzy & Proof are you with me?

Come on an everybody come on in
Kick your shoes off mother fuckers come on in

Wake your ass up mother fuckers quit yawnin'

If you don't know the words an you can't sing along an
Fake like you know em mother fuckers an join in
Everybody come on in

They consider me the epitome of a beef starter
In a party with heat it's hard to keep me without one
Fuck snubs I walk in clubs with a shotgun
Constantly popin slugs they hot son, better not run
The bosses of all bosses a haluocaust to whoever ain't concious
In a house full of dog shit
I'mma gothic death project, you stop breathin
You die quicker than mach speed without bleedin
It ain't about what you readin
When you meet me better speak like a season's greetins
Either that or we'll be beefin free when
You niggas need a 'E' just to speak shit!
Your leader is a botique bitch
Keep the heater where you can reach quick
I snipe you with it and we won't even keep it a secret
Nigga I did it from a mind of a mental patient
When Glocks wave you can save that conversation for satan
You brave?

Come on an everybody come on in
Kick your shoes off mother fuckers come on in
Cause we get it on an till the brick of dawn and
Wake your ass up mother fuckers quit yawnin'

Fake like you know em mother fuckers an join in
Everybody come on in

Yo yo I heard you niggas don't like us
But so what this beef is like
'What tha fuck did he say in his rap Em?'
I can see that he's just a punk
I mean these niggas squeeze on me
Please I'm seeing guts
I don't need no enemies, as my family a couple trucks
Am I empty seein them ?? I emtpy out them ?? to fight you
In front of every reporter that I don't like
No need for metaphors I get points across when I write
So emotions enough to say "fuck you bitch, and I don't like you, WHAT!"
I might as well give this up like heavy sales
And just fuck an leave D12 and this blunt
We can't self destruct
I've never felt it this much
Come on fellas, get up
We got to fight like Bugz last night of his life

I walk with a limp, pistol hangin off'a tha hip
I'm awkward and quick enough an sick when sparkin a fith
Your carcus is split even the beef is partially thick
We can't take you serious, you a comedy skit
You probaly wish that you could be out shootin them G's
But the only thing you shoot is the breeze
I can't believe you speaking on movin key's
But every time we hear you kick it
The only thing you sellin is wolf tickets
I look wicked cause niggas will test your nut sack
So when they bust you better bust back
And get your guts clapped outa your stomach
And when they want it (yeah)
I bring a hundred niggas from Runyan
So get to gunnin and if you comin

Come on an everybody come on in
Kick your shoes off mother fuckers come on in
Cause we get it on an till the brick of dawn and

If you don't know the words an you can't sing along an
Fake like you know em mother fuckers an join in
Everybody come on inI wasn't born mean I was pushed to treachery
I walked the streets looking for some puss to fetch me
I like a veggie brain, turn to mush, I'm edgy
Edgy enough to give Reggie Bush a wedgie
If he don't give me Kim things could get messy
So pass that ass to me, let me squish the left cheek
And pressed against the right one till it's smushed against me
And leave a dead body in the woods the MC
With the Christopher Reeves beef, we started off on the wrong foot
Or should I say fake leg, made outta wood? I shouldn't, yes I should
Riding through the hood, I'm chilling with Westwood
I'm quite mellow, a white fellow
My pee is bright yellow, I like jello, I'm like hello
To a cute little dike on the mic, I'm kinda like
Iron Mike cos I bite earlobes

Me and Westwood blasting off
Jacking off in a pair of Acid Wash, bumping Asher Roth
Crusin Gratiot till I damn near﻿ crash the car
Tryna smash a moth on the dash, hit the overpass-went off
Over the bridge, into on coming traffic
Caused a massive 42 car pile up, not a scratch at all
Hocked up holding a axe and saw
Jason mask is off but my face is plastered in Tabasco sauce
Spitting flames, kicking fire out ya ass
Ya little bastard, you can pass it on, I'm battery acid dog
You don't wanna get my ass ticked off
I'm harder than playing basketball when I'm going through crack withdraw
Dick's so big it's like elastic
I tie it in a knot and it looks like Mr. Fantastic
Crossed the path of plastic man, with a drastic force and went spastic
Put my penis on Classic SportsMeet Eddie, twenty-three years old
Fed up with life and the way things are going
He decides to rob a liquor store
("I can't take this no more, I can't take it no more homes")

But, on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart
And suddenly, his conscience comes into play
("Shit is mine, I gotta do this, gotta do this")

Alright, stop
(Huh?)
Now before you walk in the door of this liquor store
And try to get money out the drawer
You better think of the consequence
(But who are you?)
I'm your motherfuckin' conscience

That's nonsense
Go, in and gaffle the money and run to one of your aunt's cribs
And borrow a damn dress, and one of her blond wigs
Tell her you need a place to stay
You'll be safe for days if you shave your legs with an aged razor blade

Yeah, but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
Think about it before you walk in the door first
Look at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns

Fuck that, do that shit, shoot that bitch
Can you afford to blow this shit? Are you that rich?
Why you give a fuck if she dies? Are you that bitch?
Do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids?

Man, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it
(You're right)
Not over this shit, drop the biscuit
(Stop, I will)
Don't even listen to Slim yo, he's bad for you
(You know what Dre? I don't like your attitude)

("It's alright c'mon, just come in here for a minute")
("Mm, I don't know")
("Look baby")
("Damn")
("Yo, it's gonna be alright, right?")
("Well okay")

Meet Stan, twenty-one years old
("Give me a kiss")
After meeting a young girl at a rave party
Things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom
Once again, his conscience comes into play
("Shit")

Now listen to me, while you're kissin' her cheek
And smearin' her lipstick, I slipped this in her drink
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitch's earlobe
(Yo, this girl's only fifteen years old)
(You shouldn't take advantage of her, that's not fair)

Yo, look at her bush, does it got hair?
(Uh, huh)
Fuck this bitch right here on the spot bare
'Til she passes out and she forgot how she got there
(Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie kids?)

No, but I seen the porno with sun doobiest
(Shit, you wanna get hauled off to jail?)
Man fuck that, hit that shit raw dawg and bail

Meet Grady, a twenty-nine year old construction worker
After coming home from a hard day's work
He walks in the door of his trailer park home
To find his wife in bed with another man
("What the fuck? [unverified]?")
("Grady")

Alright calm down, relax, start breathin'
Fuck that shit, you just caught this bitch cheatin'
While you at work she's with some dude tryin' to get off?
Fuck slittin' her throat, cut this bitch's head off

Wait, what if there's an explanation for this shit?
(What? She tripped? Fell? Landed on his dick?)
Alright Shady, maybe he's right Grady
But think about the baby before you get all crazy

Okay, thought about it, still wanna stab her?
Grab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her?
That's what I did, be smart, don't be a retard
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped Dee Barnes?

What'chu say?
(What's wrong? Didn't think I'd remember?)
I'ma kill you motherfucker

Uh, ah Temper temper
Mr. Dre? Mr. N.W.A.?
Mr. AK comin' straight outta Compton y'all better make way?
How in the fuck you gonna tell this man not to be violent?

Cause he don't need to go the same route that I went
Been there, done that, aw fuck it
What am I sayin'? Shoot 'em both Grady, where's your gun at?[Green Lantern]
Okay (Yeah)
It's about that time again (Haha)

Green Lantern (That's Right)
G-G-G-G-G Uni-(burp)

Hahaha...Shady

We Back (Invasion) Part II

The Conspiracy

Cause we ain't gonna never stop, you just keep wasting your energy
On us, you should find something to do with your time (time)
And quit fuckin' with us cause we ain't fuckin' with you
And E must be fuckin' with you so much you must be gone out your mind

They say I'm a day away from my entire empire crumbling
Speak up you're mumbling, what the fuck-a you's a
Bibi-bay okay big-bi-bi-baby
This is Shady I know you was bi-bi-hoping we be-be-would just go away
But weeble mable weeble wobble but we don't fall down like
Jam Master Jay's two turntables, our label is just too stable
Your magazine's so motherfucking thin you using staples
To hold it together it's turning back into a newspaper
And ya'll got somethin' for my ass every issue
Thank you, cause I keep runnin' out of fucking tissues
And I could diss you but God I was sick of looking at you
At least now I can see when Nike's got a new tennis shoe
But-but I guess no good news is always good good news
Moving on to bigger and better things (chicka chicka jeera)
50's blowing up, this year just keeps going up
What the fuck is going on? Who the fuck is Norah Jones?
Shady, wait a minute, baby, leave the whore alone
Just go up there and be humble and take them awards home
Bush has just declared the world a fucking war zone
Meanwhile we got a war going on of our own at home
My fuckin' mind's blown, trying to figure out how to fight my own clone
Rhinestones are so nice, they shine so bright especially at night
After a hit of ecstasy, ain't that right Ro'oh?
Wait a minute I'm rambling, back to the matter at hand
It's Green Lantern with Elvis Presley the selfish MC
Back to the ruin rap and destroy the industry
Single handedly and oh man did we, yeah me and 50
Obie, me and Twizzy
And Nelly and Missy and Jigga god damn it's all a plan devised by the man
It's a conspiracy...against fake shit, and anybody who can't make hits
Or ain't dope lyrically, so fuck what you heard and what you read about
We ain't ruining rap baby we're just trying to weed it out

Shady in the place to be see, and I got what it takes to rock the mic, aiight!
Still keep talking shit to me punk
Cause your magazine's over in less than 6 months!
Haha...Shady Records, still Aftermath!
And don't think we can hear you motherfuckers talking, cause we can't
We don't hear y'all
So we just gonna sit back for the rest of our lives
While you ride our dicks[Eminem]
Shady/Aftermath !
Stat Quo, [?] Lantern, Whoo Kid, let's go !
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one...
*Gunshot*[Produced by Dr. Dre]

Ladies and gentlemen, the moment you've all been waiting for
In this corner, weighing 175 pounds
With a record of 17 rapes, 400 assaults and 4 murders
The undisputed, most diabolical villain in the world, Slim Shady

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
O-oh, o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got clothes
Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them and there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us and my posse's kicking up dust
It's on till the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

Ok, let's go
Back with Andre the giant, mister elephant tusk
Fix your musk, you'll be just another one bit the dust
Just one of my mother's sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt, lick fromunda cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must I redeem my name and haters get mushed
Bitches lust, man they love me when I lay in the cutt
Fisticuffs, the lady give her eighty some paper cut
Now picture us, it's ridiculous you curse at the thought
Cause when I spit the verse the shit gets worse than Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
It's elementary, the elephants have entered the room
I venture to say with the center of attention it's true
Not to mention back with a vengeance so here's the signal
Of the bat symbol, the platinum trio's back on you hoes


Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Dre

They see that low rider go by they're like "Oh my"
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick cause I know why
I dip through in that six trey like sick 'em Dre
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me
But hey, what else can I say, I love LA
Cause over and above all, it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again
I'll be damned, just fucked around and crashed my Benz
Driving around with a smashed front end, let's cash that one in
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino, or the El Dorado
The hell if I know, do I want leather seats or vinyl
Decisions, decisions, garage looks like Precision Collision
Or Maaco beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low, speakers away from your face though


And I take great pleasure in introducing, 50 Cent

It's bottle after bottle
The money ain't a thang when you party with me
It's what we into, it's simple
We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe
I'm the napalm, the bomb, the don
I'm King Kong, get rolled, on wrapped up and reigned on
I'm so calm, through Vietnam, ring the alarm
Bring the Chandon, burn marijuana, do what you want
Nigga on and on, till the break of what
Get the paper man, I'm caking, you know I don't give a fuck
I spend it like it don't mean nothing
Blow it like it's supposed to be blown, motherfucker I'm grown
I stunt, I style, I flash the shit
I gets what the fuck I want so what I trick
Fat ass Birkin bags, some classy shit
Jimmy Choo shoes, I say move a bitch move

Oooh! Ladies and gentlemen, the moment you've all been waiting for
In this corner, weighing 175 pounds, with a record of 17 rapes, 400
Assaults, and 4 murders
The undisputed, most diabolical villain in the world, Slim Shady!

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model
You just hit the lotto
Uh oh uh oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves
Now where's the rubbers? Whose got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them and there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us and my posse's kicking up dust
It's on till the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

Ladies and gentlemen, Dr Dre

They see that low rider go by there, like "Oh my!"
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick cuz I know why
I dip through in that six trey like sick 'em Dre
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me
But hey, what else can I say? I love LA
Cuz over and above all, it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again
I'll be damned, just fucked around and crashed my Benz
Driving around with a smashed front end
Let's cash that one in
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino or the El Derado
The hell if I know
Do I want leather seats or vinyl
Decisions, decisions garage looks like precision collision
Or maico beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low speakers away from your face though


Back when Andre, the giant, mister elephant tusk
Picture us, you'll just be another one bit the dust
Just one of my mother's son who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt lick my wonder cheese from under my nuts
They disgust, me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must, I redeem my name n haters get murked
Bitches lust man they love me when I lay in the cut
Missed the cut the lady give a raidy some paper cut
Now picture us It's ridiculous you curse at the thought
Cuz when I spit the verse the shit gets worse and worse cause your soft
If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
It's elementary the elephants have entered the room
I venture to say with the same repetition is true
Not to mention back with a vengeance, so here's the signal
Of the bat symbol The platinum dude is back on you hoes


It's sorta like pourin' Draino down a live volcano
You never know what'll happen next, it may blow
Same thing happens to the beats when Dre blows
I talk shit, but my dick's long as my payroll
I get ass like a ball player, but I'm a boss player
Pimpin' hoes from here to Australia
Till I get heart failure
Look at ya half of ya'll, all scared
Other half, hands up in the air, like "Awww yeah"
This is our year, this is what you call sheer talent
But I think at this point it's just obvious
Fierce, they say my music's good for all queers
Cuz I make your ear ring, get it?, piercin' all ears
Call us the Mafia, we got the fucking mob here
Gimme the hate and I'll feed off of ya's all year
Shit, I'm just doing my job here
You don't want no problem, do ya?
Fuck it, I'll even crack a bottle for ya

"Other man!"

I stand in slapped by the wind as I begin
Do you know who I am? And many reply with a grin
Yes, I'm tired of being obtruded
Why should I be secluded? I've got a brand new horn to be tooted
To sum it up in a nutshell, "Eminem will you kick it for me?"
So I find myself in a certain obligatory
A place that I dwell in, fell into some wonderful productions
To make up for lost time, and then it brings obstruction
Finally let loose, unloading the stockpile
A mental projectile, I aim at the reptile
I look to the one handed juggler and ask him this
"Why is it you insist upon stepping to an octopus?"
Is there a reason for this? The hindrance is aggravating
How many times will it take you before you realize you're fading?
Fading from existence, cause simulations are dead
There's so much more to learn and pages left to be read
So put up the front while you jam for the grammar that's poor
While I hold the scrapbook that's heavier than the hammer of the mighty Thor
Words can weigh a ton
Therefore it's never to fall into the hands of the wrong one


Very few have made an attempt to put in a foot on the other side
But I see no borderline, from under this colorblind
And some will probably never hold pieces of the sacred
But then I'm finally about to put an end to the hatred
Wrong, the world would never endure to arguing
Awaking to the absence of unity is startling
"Oh foolish pride, what the hell are you trying to do?
You cannot beat someone that's better than you so quit trying to"
Your echoing words that mean nothing are despicable
So how do you think you can manage to kick the unkickable
You're graceless, bland, you're tasteless and you're faceless faceless
Damn, you're dull it's time you faced this, here taste this
Straight from off of the pile, one of the numerous styles
The date of my birth on the Earth, the deliverance of a starchild
Blessed with formidable talent and versatility
But with such a power, there comes a responsibilty
To infringe on the boundaries, so now the defiance is clear
To form an alliance is something even the giants fear
So instead of being oblivious to the color of skin
Refusal of usin' is accepted now it's a trend



You know I don't understand why we all just can't get along
You hate me but you know me and what I stand for
No. so then why do you speak for me
And every other white man when you that we're your enemy?

On the floor lies a broken door, cause I'm not to be spoken for
Stereotypes and superstitions and fictional folklore
Rarely do you see the lighter side of me
I try to be persuasive but also invasive and try to end the rivalry
But ? is isolated, apologies are exhausted
Feelings are turning glacial never to be defrosted
Who can I trust after repeatedly being shafted
Switch to the opposite, now scenes are being re-enacted
Pull up that boy by his roots, destroy him quick
His fracture's obviating, we hate him, his patterns past us, huh
Always fighting for the position of top dog
That spot's already occupied, and I don't play leapfrog
Cause I do not wish to fight over territory that's already mine
But I'm always having to prove myself, time after time
Oh how I never understand how a man could be outcast
Judged from the past and he's put last
And others with nothing to say
Stutterin' and slurrin' and mutterin' words with no meaning attack be signin' like Danny Kaye
Here I go again hammerin stammerin grammerin
And eat it like cheese, pass me the crackers please
I've got a craving[Intro - Sample: Heart - Crazy on You]
Tell myself that I was doing alright
There's nothing left to do tonight

But go crazy on you.. crazy on you!
Let me go crazy, crazy on youuuuuuuuuu-ohhhhhh

Can't you see what you do to me baby?
You make me crazy, you make me act like a maniac
I'm like a lunatic, you make me sick
You're truly the only one who can do this to me
You just make me get so crazy
I go schizo, I get so insane I just go schizophrenic
One minute I want to slit your throat, the next I wanted sex
You make me crazy, the way we act like two maniacs in the sack
We fuck like two jackrabbits and maybe that's a bad habit
Cause the next day we're right back at it
In the same exact pattern
What the fuck is the matter with us?
We can't figure out if it's lust
Or it's love what's that that's attracting us to each other?
They say that every man grows up to marry his own mother
Which would explain why you're such a motherfuckin' bitch
But I stay and still stick it out with you
Even though I just hit you today
But you deserve it you hit me first and provoked me to choke you
Just cause I came home late last night crawled in bed and I woke you
But if there's one thing about you that I admire it's baby
Because you stay with me, maybe, because you're as crazy as I am
Cause when I look at you I can see an angel in your eyes
But if I look deeper inside I see your freakish little side
Like a devil in disguise, you're always full of surprises
Always pullin' devices out your purse little vibrators and dildoes
You fucked yourself so much you barely feel those anymore
You're only 24 but you're plenty more ma-ture
Than those other little hoes who just act like little girls
Like they're in middle school still you're crazy sexy cool, chillin'
You play your position you never step out of line
Even though I stay in your business you've always kept out of mine
I wonder what's on your mind, sometimes they say love is blind
Maybe that's why the first time I dotted your eye you ain't see the sign
Or maybe you did, maybe you like being shoved
Maybe cause we're crazy in loooove


You are the ink to my paper, what my pen is to my pad
The moral, the very fiber, the whole substance to my rap
You are my reason for being, the meaning of my existence
If it wasn't for you I would never be able to spit this
As intense as I do and the irony is you rely on me
As much as I rely on you to inspire me like you do
You provide me the lighter fluid, the fuel to my fire
You're my entire supply - gas, the match, and igniter
The only way that I am able to stay so stable is you're the legs to my table
If you were to break I'd fall on my face
But I'm always gonna make you feel I don't need you as much
As I really need you so you don't use it to your advantage
But you're essential to me you're the air I breathe I believe
If you ever leave me I'd probably have no reason to be
You are the Kim to my Marshall you're the Slim to my Shady
The Dre to my Eminem, the Alaina to my Hailie
You are the words that I'm lookin' for when I'm tryin' to describe
How I feel inside and the right one that just won't come to my mind
You're like the pillar that props me up, the beam that supports me
The bitch who never took half, the wife who never divorced me
You're like the root to my evil, you let my devil come out me
You let me beat the shit out you before you beat the shit out me
And no matter how much too much is never enough
Maybe because we're crazy in looooove

A lotta people ask me stupid fucking questions
A lotta people think that what I say on record
Or what I talk about on a record
That I actually do in real life or that I believe in it
Or if I say that I wanna kill somebody, that
I'm actually gonna do it or that I believe in it
Well shit, if you believe that, then I'll kill you
You know why? Cause I'm a criminal
Criminal
Yeah I'm a criminal

My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge
That'll stab you in the head, whether you're a fag or lez
Or a homosex, hermaph or a trans-a-vest
Pants or dress, hate fags? the answer's "yes"
Homophobic? Nah, you're just heterophobic
Staring at my jeans, watching my genitals bulging
That's my motherfuckin' balls, you'd better let go of 'em
They belong in my scrotum, you'll never get hold of 'em!
"Hey, it's me, Versace! Whoops, somebody shot me!
And I was just checking the mail, get it? Checking the 'male'?"
How many records you expecting to sell
After your second LP sends you directly to jail?
Come on, relax guy, I like gay men
Right, Ken? Give me an amen! (A-men!)
"Please Lord, this boy needs Jesus
Heal this child, help us destroy these demons
Oh, and please send me a brand new car
And a prostitute while my wife's sick in the hospital"
Preacher preacher! Fifth grade teacher!
You can't reach me, my mom can't neither
You can't teach me a goddamn thing, cause
I watch TV and Comcast cable
And you ain't able to stop these thoughts
You can't stop me from topping these charts
And you can't stop me from dropping each March
With a brand new CD for these fuckin' retards
And to think, it's just little ol' me
Mr. Don't-Give-a-Fuck still won't leave

I'm a criminal! Cause every time I write a rhyme
These people think it's a crime to tell 'em what's on my mind
I guess I'm a criminal! But I don't got to say a word
I just flip 'em the bird and keep going, I don't take shit from no one

Mother did drugs, hard liquor, cigarettes, and speed
The baby came out, disfigured ligaments indeed
It was a seed who would grow up just as crazy as she
Don't dare make fun of that baby cause that baby was me
I'm a criminal, an animal caged who turned crazed
But how the fuck you supposed to grow up when you weren't raised?
So as I got older and I got a lot taller
My dick shrunk smaller, but my balls got larger
I drink more liquor to fuck you up quicker
Than you'd wanna fuck me up for saying the word ______
My morals went *Pffft* when the president got oral
Sex in his Oval Office on top of his desk
Off of his own employee, now don't ignore me, you won't avoid me
You can't miss me, I'm white, blonde-haired and my nose is pointy
I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
In plane crashes and laughs as long as it ain't happened to him
Slim Shady, I'm as crazy as Eminem and Kim combined, "The maniac's in"
Replacing the doctor cause Dre couldn't make it today
He's a little under the weather, so I'm taking his place
Oh, that's Dre with an AK to his face
Don't make me kill him too and spray his brains all over the place
I told you Dre, you shoulda kept that thang put away
I guess that'll teach you not to let me play with it, eh?

Get the motherfucking money and get the fuck up outta there
(whistling) How you doin'?
And I won’t kill you!

Windows tinted on my ride when I drive in it
So when I rob a bank, run out and just dive in it
So I'll be disguised in it
And if anybody identifies the guy in it
I hide for 5 minutes
Come back, shoot the eyewitness
Fire at the private eye hired to pry in my business
Die, bitches, bastards, brats, pets
This puppy's lucky I didn't blast his ass yet
If I ever gave a fuck, I'd shave my nuts
Tuck my dick in between my legs and cluck
You motherfuckin' chickens ain't brave enough
To say the stuff I say, so just tape it shut
Shit, half the shit I say, I just make it up
To make you mad so kiss my white naked ass
And if it's not a rapper that I make it as
I'mma be a fucking rapist in a Jason mask

I'm a criminal! Cause every time I write a rhyme
These people think it's a crime to tell 'em what's on my mind
I guess I'm a criminal! But I don't got to say a word
I just flip 'em the bird and keep going, I don't take shit from no one
I am a criminal![Produced by Bass Brothers]

Yeah, haha, whoo, shit
Yo, mic check, testing one, two, um.. twelve
Whattup whattup whattup! (Outsidaz)
This is my dance song; can you hear me?
(Rah Digga, Pacewon, Young Zee)
Alright, ay turn my headphones up

My favorite color is red, like the blood shed
From Kurt Cobain's head when he shot himself dead
Women all grabbin' at my shish-kabob
Bought Lauryn Hill's tape so her kids could starve
(“I can’t stand white people”)
You thought I was ill and now I'm even more so
Shit I got full-blown AIDS and a sore throat
I got a wardrobe with an orange robe
I'm in the fourth row, signin' autographs at your show
I just remembered that I'm absent-minded
Wait, I mean I've lost my mind, I can't find it
I'm freestylin' every verse that I spit
Cause I don't even remember the words to my shit
I told the doc I need a change in sickness
And gave a girl herpes in exchange for syphilis
Put my LP on your Christmas gift list
You want to get high? Here, bitch, just sniff this!

Cum on everybody (get down tonight)

I tried suicide once and I'll try it again
That's why I write songs where I die at the end
Cause I don't give a fuck, like my middle finger was stuck
And I was wavin' it at everybody screaming, "I suck" (I suck!)
I go on stage in front of a sellout crowd
And yell out loud: "All y'all get the hell out now"
Fuck rap, I'm givin' it up y'all, I'm sorry
(But Eminem this is your record release party)
I'm bored out of my gourd
So I took a hammer and nailed my foot to the floorboard of my Ford
Guess I'm just a sick sick bastard
Who's one sandwich short of a picnic basket
One Excedrin tablet short of a full medicine cabinet
I feel like my head has been shredded like lettuce and cabbage
And if you ever see a video for this shit
I'll probably be dressed up like a mummy with my wrists slit


Got bitches on my jock out in East Detroit
Cause they think that I'm a mothafuckin' Beastie Boy
So I told em I was Mike D
They was like, "gee I don't know, he might be!"
I told em "meet me at Kid Rock's next concert
I'll be standin' by the Loch Ness Monster"
Peace out, then I jetted to the weed house
Smoked out til I started bustin' freestyles
Broke out then I dipped quick back to the crib, put on lipstick
Crushed up the Tylenol and ate it with a dipstick
Made a couple of crank calls collect (*brrrrrrring, click*)
"It's Ken Kaniff from Connecticut, can you accept?"
I want to make songs all the fellas dub
And murder every rich rapper that I'm jealous of
So just remember when I bomb your set
Yo, I only cuss to make your mom upset[Curtains closing]



Is this thing on?
Where'd everybody go?
Guess who's back?
Back again…
Ken is back, tell some…men
Rub my back, Rub my back, Rub my back, Rub my back…
Eh….Wait…..Hello?
Eh…..GoodnightDuh, duh, duh, duh, duh, we still on?
Yo, is the mic on?
Check, check, check, a'ight, it's good, let's go on
(Eminem, Eminem, Eminem!)
Let's go, come on[Intro]
DMC, we have a mid-thirties male found down, unresponsive
Possible overdose, substance unknown, pulse is 60 and thready
Respiration's eight, he's intubated and we're baggin' him now
BP, 90 over palp, patient is cool, pale, and diaphoretic
Has aspirated, GSC is three, we'll update en route, ETA, ten minutes

As I fall deeper into a manic state
I'm a prime candidate for the gene to receive the drug addict trait
Blood pressure climbs at a dramatic rate
I seem to gravitate to the bottle of NyQuil then I salivate
Start off with the night well like, I think I'll just have a taste
Couple of sips of that then I gradually graduate
To a harder prescription drug called Valium like, yeah that's great
I go to just take one and I end up like having eight
Now I need something in my stomach cause I haven't ate
Maybe I'll grab a plate of nachos and I'll have a steak
And you'd think that with all I have at stake
Look at my daughter's face
"Mommy, something is wrong with Dad I think
He's acting weird again, he's really beginning to scare me
Won't shave his beard again and he pretends he doesn't hear me
And all he does is eat Doritos and Cheetos
And he just fell asleep in his car eating 3 Musketeers in the rear seat"

Sometimes I feel so alone, I just don't know
Feels like I been down this road before
So lonely and cold, it's like something takes over me
As soon as I go home and close the door

Kinda feels like déjà vu
I wanna get away from this place I do
But I can't and I won't
Say I try, but I know that's a lie
Cause I don't and why I just don't know

"Maybe just a nice cold brew, what's a beer?"
That's the devil in my ear
I been sober a fuckin' year
And that fucker still talks to me he's all I can fuckin' hear
"Marshall, come on we'll watch the game, it's the Cowboys and Buccaneers"
And maybe if I just drink half I'll be half buzzed
For half of the time, who's the mastermind behind that little line
With that kind of rationale man I got half a mind
To have another half of glass of wine, sound asinine
Yeah I know, but I never had no problem with alcohol
Ouch, look out for the wall, aim for the couch - I'm 'bout to fall
I missed the couch and down I go lookin' like a bouncy ball
Shit musta knocked me out cause I ain't feel the ground at all
Wow, what the fuck happened last night, where am I
Man, fuck am I hungover and goddamn I
Got a headache, shit half a Vicodin, why can't I
All systems ready for take off, please stand by


So I take a Vicodin, splash it hits my stomach then, ahhhh
Couple of weeks go by it ain't even like I'm gettin' high
Now I need it just not to feel sick, yeah I'm gettin' by
Wouldn't even be taking this shit if DeShaun didn't die
Oh yeah, there's an excuse, you lose Proof so you use
There's new rules, it's cool if it's helpin' you to get through
It's twelve noon, ain't no harm in self inducin' a snooze
What else is new, fuck it what would Elvis do in your shoes
Now here I am three months later, full-blown relapse
Just get high until the kids get home from school, holmes, relax
And since I'm convinced that I'm an insomniac
I need these pills to be able to sleep so I take three naps
Just to be able to function throughout the day, let's see
That's an Ambien each nap, how many Valium, three
And that will average out to about one good hour's sleep
Ok so now ya, see, the reason how come, he
Has taken four years to just put out an album, B
See me and you we almost had the same outcome, Heath
Cause that Christmas you know the whole pneumonia thing?
It was bologna, was it the methadone ya think?
Or the hydrocodone you hide inside your pornos
Your VCR tape cases, with your Ambien CR
Great places to hide 'em, ain't it? So you can lie to Hailie
I'm goin' beddy bye Whitney baby, good night Alaina
Go in the room and shut the bedroom door and wake up in an ambulance
They said they found me on the bathroom floor, damn

I keep dreaming of death and I'm hearing people screaming
The devil's spirit's trapped inside me and I want it out
I'm on the couch bleeding to death in a haunted house
With both of my wrists slit, I'm lifted up in the air
And suspended in animation like someone's holding me there
I feel somebody's cold hands wrapping around my neck
While I choke on my own blood that I swallow and drown to death
But I found a breath and somehow managed to slip the clutches
Nearly blacking out from dizziness and head rushes
Tripping over OD'd bodies of dead lushes
Bloodstains paint the plush carpet like red blushes
Door's open and close by themselves
Books fly off shelves, curtains catch fire, the house melts
My skin blisters and sticks together like twin sisters
The wind blows and shatters windows like ten twisters
Caught a piece of shrapnel in the Adam's apple
Two cups of holy water and I'm looking at 'em half full
But as soon as I go to touch 'em they turn into red rum
It got silent, then all these voices said
"Come follow me into the gates of Hell"
I heard 'em yell "Welcome to the Norman Bates Motel!"
I ring the bell for service and I was greeted by his mother
Covered in dry blood, head still dented from the shovel
I said I need a room so I could try to get some rest
She gave me the keys to the best suite and a bag of cess
And told me that's just for starters, Satan'll be in to see me later
To see if I'm interested in being partners[Intro: Proof]
Yo, ayyo turn the heads up and the mics up
We got the Dreadknaughts, y'knahmsayin
Super MC, y'knahmean
Bugz, Dirty and all that, all that shit, y'knahmsayin
Desperados with the cars, Eminem

Chauvinist pig, drove in this big Lincoln
Till it went over the bridge
Jumped out and dove in the ditch
Broke in a mobile home and stole a stove and a fridge
Kidnapped the parents and left the ransom note for the kids
I'ma go for your mids, here's a body blow for your ribs
While you're clutching your stomach and bleeding all over your bitch
I know where you live, your girl showed me your crib
Unless she told me a fib, then I'ma have both of ya did
Burning incense, facing a murder sentence
Under intense investigation for killing infants
While I sit in padded rooms doing shrooms
Having visions of dead pregnant women with brooms jabbed in they wombs
Slit your carpet and rugs and fuck your apartment up
Sticking it far with drugs, and jumping in garbage trucks
I'm from the shitty slums that look like the city dumps
Give you a kidney punch, and mug you to get me lunch
See me every summer laying up against the dumpster
With a hundred dollar jumper smothered in Southern Comfort
Got my Slim Shady sticker on your mother's bumper
She came home screaming, a bunch of motherfuckers jumped her

Ayyo, proceed to list em, there's no need to diss em
Down here we heat em, destroy your whole breathing system
Twist em like beer caps once they hear that
Rap murder rates, and I snap vertebrates
Collapse further states, my track preserve the great
Your pack deserve a crate, in fact the word is fate
I kill you slow like AIDS-infested nuts
I'm holding vendetta like seven great-molested sluts
Calling me a bitch nigga, you need to stop
Reality, one on one, how many times you got dropped?
I'm cutthroat when any track runs, conscious when I smack nuns
The rough neck that make Muslims run and pack guns
I'm volcanic, the sermon preacher
Burning emcees, most wanted by Herman Kiefer
You tried to get a squad, they was like "Money, oh no"
Leave you brain-dead, hitting trees with Sonny Bono
I kick without a dojo, D12 slow flow
Shoot down your mothership and pimp-smack mojo
No pro wanna go knuckle-blades with the renegade
Nigga tried to go pop, and plus they minute-made
My lieutenant sprayed your brigade and trampled your flow
Big P, the reason emcees cancelled they show
The truth will hurt, seeing Proof at work, no shame in it
The best part of your show is when you put my name in it
My squad be godly, fearing shit hardly
So I hope when I'mma die, dope like Chris Farley

Fuck that!
Who run shit once these drums hit?
You dove headfirst into some old dumb shit
Here's a can of asswhip, for you to come get
Yo' click made they trip, I make them hoes suck mint
Ask them girl, they know the scoop, don't fuck with Bugz bitch
I chop off her titty, have you sucking one tit
Them pink belly niggas, is who you run wit
Making half-ass songs, shitty snares and one kick
I hate yo' damn sound, don't like it one bit~!
You could make a double album, won't have one hit
Your entire outfit, is on some bullshit
And there's not a damn one that I can't outwit
I ad-mit, that my style is unfit
For momma's baby boy, because I'm on some dumb shit
Like I commit, larceny, give harm quick
You pull the alarm switch I stab you in your armpit
Now who the nitwit wanna come get wit
This egotistic Hip Hop fundamentalistic?
Don't risk it, you get your shit split
Now keep your distance, and keep existence
I'm persistent when it comes to bent shit
I smoke a, blunt with my judge right before my sentence
I'm relentless, to deny is senseless
Yo' bitch paid my bill, that's where the hell yo' rent went
Fuck that!

I kill competition, with no way out as an opposition
Execute the passengers on the flight, my executive decision
Then reminisce on how Shady the business
Terrorists asked by Iraelis when they visit
Bombing incentive, World War Three in the making
Murdered the exhibition, team finish! Beat the ref senseless!
No timeout, extended play burns over your intermission
Then christen the battlefield with the blood of Christians
Crying for the messiah, but he don't listen
I pop my wig when I top the stove frame, boil sizzling
A pyromaniac cook, I do damage to kitchens
Fuck Home Depot, I demolition
When I home improve, you need Bob here to fix it
Fuck school and supervision
Bit off of financial aid and smoked up my tuition
Only hang around rappers with explicit lyrics
And pistol-grip punks for the beefing, do you wanna get heated?

I got a mind full of troubles, everything's in doubles
I buy my guns in couples, no time for placement fumbles
Cause emcees come and emcees go, with broke flow
Injured from head to toe, no fitter model, we full-throttle
You stuck in low, incapable to master flow
Everything is tactical, living mathematical
I smash the flow, unleash and let go
I shit like lava, original designer
Married to marijuana since a minor
Making attempts to sink my battleship could get you bent like fibs, what?
Applying death-defying feats, maintain to keep my peace
Flow like the sea when I release these beats over concrete

My presidented transition has taken place
As I express vocally on the M-I-C-R-O
Power he's cipher, not equality, I deal it
Lace the track and made it real, now I know my people feel it
Keep their heads bobbing and the emotionals sobbing
Plus a culture-cipher after shows, hoes slobbing
Knobs, love the fucking flavor of the icing
Plus I'm precise and, my double edge continue slicing[Verse 1]
Girl, you give me writer's block
I'm at a loss for words, uhh
My mind's as lost as yours
I rack my brain but still no thoughts emerge
Never seen no ass as large as yours
How much that cost? That's what I call the cost to splurge
You drive me bonkers, I’m about to get my swerve on for sure
Thought I was pimpin' 'til I felt like Nas, the first
Date cause I think I gave you power, when I gave you flowers in a vase
A box of chocolates, throat lozengers, cough drops and Certs
Probably should've never let me call that job of yours
To talk to your boss and ask him if you can take off from work
Should've been one of the first signs to cause alert
Man we jumped in too fast, cause since then I just can't be apart from her
Cause nobody's body's awesomer, I lust it and she loves me
Cause I'm popular, but you know this ain't love

You know this ain't love, you know this ain't love
You know this ain't love, you know this ain't love (What is it then?)
It's desperation (She's looking for Mr. Right, wants me to be that guy to her)
It's desperation (I can't even put up a fight, cause I give in at the sight of her)
(And I here I go again)

You were obviously oblivious to me, I swore I was just invisible to you
Till I went to the lengths I did to meet you
Cause you played so hard to get with me from the beginning
Now I'm in disbelief I, never knew that this could be such misery, ah
Cause now you see nothing but me, and I don't see nothing but you
And I'm about to flip cause we are super glued in
We stuck to each other's hips and we can't
Do anything individually, which is to cling on, scared to be alone
Can't, specifically describe it I just can't seem to give a reason
This definitive, just need you, talking bout I live and breathe you
And you pretend to be as mentally and physically
Addicted to me as Wiz Khalifa is to reefer
Don't wanna be without you
Don't wanna be with you neither, bitch
Put me in a situation in which it's both I wish to seek
Cause this ain't love

You know this ain't love, you know this ain't love
You know this ain't love, you know this ain't love (What is it then?)
It's desperation (She's looking for Mr. Right, wants me to be that guy to her)
It's desperation (I can't even put up a fight, cause I give in at the sight of her)
(And I here I go again)

Just want you to myself, don't wanna share you with no one else
"What the fuck you whispering for?
You get on my nerves, you make me sick
I think our relationship, it seems to be on the fritz
I mean it's time that we just split and leave the
Games behind your frame of mind ain't the same as mine
I think you need to finish developing a little more mentally too"
Get the picture
That's a negative, Alicia, I will never give the keys up
To the crib, ever again, no reason not even a gift certificate from Tiffany's
You better have an epiphany, slut, guess what? The lease up
I'm just mad the time it took to discover
You were using me for loot like I used you for looks
Oh, thought you was too good for me, huh? yeah
Toots, used to be my Carrie Underwood, I was your lumberjack
But I can't stomach this, I'm leaving you, I'm not coming back
She said, "The fuck with that, where's my Louisville Slugger at?"
She grabbed that fucking bat and swung it at my head
I barely ducked and that's right
When she came up with a kick to the nuts twice, steel toe
Girl probably coulda put a 100-yard field goal through the uprights

You know this ain't love, you know this ain't love
You know this ain't love, you know this ain't love (What is it then?)
It's desperation (She's looking for Mr. Right, wants me to be that guy to her)
It's desperation (I can't even put up a fight, cause I give in at the sight of her)
(And I here I go again)I come around like what goes around, what goes up must come down
Anyone who comes up must go down, might as well go for the gusto now
Better not let up, better not let them breathe, last shot, give it all you got
Try to turn me down, bitch, get fucked with a volume knob, fuck all you snobs
Hoes, I hope all you rot, two bottles of Lubriderm and a box of condoms
Is that all you brought? And you want a ménage à trois, you twats?
Fuck that, I'd rather turn this club to a bar-room brawl
Get rowdy as Roethlisberger in a bathroom stall
Like a leech stuck in a vacuum y'all, ain't nothing but a whole lot of sucking
Going on in rap, yeah but I'm home, bad to the bone
Back in the zone, let him alone, you don't want to go eggin' him on
It'll never be my chair that you own, crown so tight that it cuts off
Circulation to the brain, no oxygen, other words, there's no heir to the throne
When I die so does hip-hop, Hitchcock of the shit bitch ask Doc
Doc got it ziplocked in a bag, you fags ain't been able to fade me
Since Kid Rock had a high top, keep bloggin' while I mind-boggle
And I zone like I'm in the twilight, dog, get off my bone
This is my mic, doggonit; I like hoggin' it
Flow's so wet I'mma take this beat tobogganin', I'm waterloggin' it
I'm soggin' it, pull your verse out the beat and stomp on it
Suplexing it on cement like I'm on some "Straight Outta Compton" shit
Take this dick and chomp on it, I'm so bad I can bitch-slap
A back-handed compliment, jackass, eat a donkey dick
The game I just about conquered it, like Donkey Kong, I'm bonkers, bitch
I'm the king of this honkey shit, I reign supreme in this honkey shit
No sense screaming and arguing, makes no difference
Whether a Benz or Bentley or a Beamer's the car you in
You think you ball? Well, I palm it, I throw up bombs when I vomit
Boy, I throw down in the kitchen might hit your mom with my omelette
But you got egg on your face, now watch me drop an atomic
I should be strapped to the chest of a kamikaze
Bitch, I'm as batshit as Ozzy, it's obvious, you can tell right off the bat
No pun intended, but come any closer, I'll bite off your head
Tryna give me the finger's kinda like giving a spider the web
I'm just gonna spin it and try to use it to my advantage
I'll catch a fly in that bitch, you think you fly, you just food
I give as much of a flying fuck as that Superman dude
Guess I just do what you can't do and make you look stupid and bamboozled
Confused as usual and you can get whipped, she can open a can too
But you better hope you can handle the heat or stay the fuck
Outta Hell's kitchen, I came to cock block like a square
Fucking male chicken, yeah, it's Shady, slut; the rest
Can suck on a big one, cause I'm as despicable as Daffy Duck when I'm spittin'Spoken:
Nah, fuck an intro man, lets go

I come around like what goes around
What goes up must come down
Anyone who comes up must go down
Might as well go for the gusto now

Better not let up better not let them breath, last shot give it all you got
Try to turn me down bitch get fucked with the volume nob, fuck all you snobs
Hoes I hope all you rot, two bottles of Lubriderm and a box of condoms
Is that all you brought, and you want a ménage à trois you twats

Fuck that I'd rather turn this club, to a bar room brawl
Get rowdy as Roethlisberger, in a bathroom stall
Like a leech stuck, in a vacuum ya'll
Ain't nothin' but a whole lot of suckin', goin' on

In rap, yeah but I'm home, bad to the bone back in the zone
Let him alone you don't wanna go eggin' him on, it'll never be my chair that you own
Crown so tight that it cuts off circulation to the brain no oxygen
Other words there's no heir to the throne

When I die so does hip-hop, Hitchcock better shit bitch ass doc, got it zip locked
In a bag, you fags ain't been able to fade me since Kid Rock had a hi-top

See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that (static)
Detroit vs. Everybody

I took a bite out the rotten apple by the poison tree
All these females need to email to make noise
And now things changin' a lot, he fuck with my authority
Then he shall see shells, but not by the seashore
If he gang bangin' or not
It's simple as the alphabet
He F with me, that G shall surely see
He definitely as 'bout it as retail fraud, he's sweet
The honest gesture
The trigger finger 'round the diamond tester
We tell flaw with heat
The same soldier, it's me, myself and I
Ridin' 'round shootin' my biopic in my autobiography
Range Rover, this ain't the squash beef state
You thinkin' makeup, we thinkin' Lark Voorhies face
The twin Eagles ol' Air, his coupe
Might as well ride by in an ambulance
My pair'll shoot like skydivin' in Hammer pants
So call it siblin' rivalry
Take his life, call it the unforgivable robbery
A wise man told me that holdin' a grudge is like
Lettin' somebody just live inside of your head rent free
(Real talk) I don't got time to evict these clowns
Y'all niggas been bitches, that's none of my business, but I don't sip tea
(It's Nickel) Ridin' 'round this block
All he knows is pitfalls, that's why he's always climbin' out his drop
(I got a question) Do you wanna ride or die?
(Welcome to Detroit, motherfucka)

Boy I need no halves and halves, I want the game in entirety
100 percent cut, no stitches required
Welcome to Detroit where if you get that promotion
Don't worry, man them bullets will still be at your ass firin'
I still call it safe, I would suck if I was umpirin'
Boy I hit the beat I just treat that shit like a diary
I'm offended if you hear my new shit and you ain't rewindin' me
Self made, I never needed your bail or a wire, see
I'm never callin' collect, I call to collect
My homie wanted a Chevy so I put my dog in the vet
Ahh! Plus I'm so loyal that that paper, boy, is all that I fetch
If the ball in my hand then the ball in the net
Bitch I'm the D, can't no offense dunk on me
I'm Mr. Big Shot, these hoes get drunk off me
I'm overrespected, my mama gated community's overprotective
So futuristic, I'm already over my next bitch
Reminiscin' on listenin' to 50 fifty times a day
Back when tenth grade was like fifty days away
Tryna get paid fifty ways a day
Used to put fifty on the layaway, now my closet fifty shades of grey
Twenty six and I done lived a lifetime a few times
From futons to Grey Poupons
In church tryna get a little savings, yeah a coupon
I spit that A1 every day, I'm hittin' new primes
Now the stakes high, niggas surprised at the new lines
Takin' down my number like "you still ain't got a new line?"
Nah it's the same, we been laborin' for years
I know it took way longer than nine months, but fuck it, it's all in due time
I turned a blunt to a roach with dreams of bein' a Beatle
Don't want to, I need to, ya gotta learn to keep it cerebral
When you come up in a place where everyone got a piece but ain't peaceful
This is just part one, wait 'til the sequel
Lil' bitch

Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that (static)
I swear I love my city, I just want less (static)
See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that (static)
Detroit vs. Everybody

Comin' from them streets where they thirsty, starvin' to eat
Just a step away from failin', that's why they call it the D
Arguably the whole reason for all of this honesty
Honestly no honor roll, but honored up in them streets
Cause I'm a Linwood nigga, them young niggas hit ya
Put a stack on your head, you'll bleed a lake on Grand River
If you think your hood harder then I might beg to differ
Know some killers pull the trigger for a Swisher and Miller
If the blicka hit your kisser, bet your ass not remembering
They say my city's tougher than two fat bitches scissoring
So nigga I'm a veteran, retire my letterman
Has K's in front ya school, but I ain't going to Kettering
Cough up a lung, 313 where I'm from
Xan got me cross eyed like Bernstein’s son
Any nigga try to copy, put a hole in his top
It's us vs. them, Detroit vs. Everybody

Lately it seems as if it's me against the world
Like it was before my life became a movie
And they used to use my mothafuckin' trailer to tease me with
But I flipped that script like a refill of
Painkillers to pop the lid off that safety seal
It made me feel amazing, Navy SEAL of bravery
And if I may reiterate, I ain't even need a script
Ain't bein' conceited
But I made it to radio, eat a dick
I still never ABC'd the shit
Mainstream appeal but the skill is what made me iller
Since before they called Jay Dee Dilla
I was daydreamin' one day I would be the shit
And if I ever end up escapin' these streets I swear that I would stay here still
And if I'm crazy, I'll always be real
Don't make me steal an eighteen-wheeler
Break all of my friends out of here and take 'em straight to the Mercedes dealer
Peel off back to the same block that we came from, on a rampage too crazy for me to flip
What's makin' you think I need a switch? Cause I'm Adrian Peterson
When he's raging and heated and on the way to go beat his kid
On a track get spanked like he just did
(DETROIT!) I can't never leave this bitch
Sick of bein' treated like we ain't shit
But Jesus, I can see just why people quit callin' me to do features
And them cyphers on BET cause if I wasn't me
I probably wouldn't want to play with me neither, shit
Seems to be reachin' its fever pitch
One hundred and eighty degrees in here
Shoulder blade full of cedar chips
MCs just bit off more than they can chew like a face full of Swedish Fish
Or Lorena with two penises
Hateful and geniusness inconvenience
And for the record, you don't want this type of static in your life
When I'm makin' you cling to it
May consider tryin' to reinsulate ya windows
May be in for another crazy winter
Cause so cold in the D, it is as days begin to tick away
But ain't this really what made me into the angry bitter blonde
But ain't we sick of bein' underdogs
Don't make me unleash this shit, release this Pit
May even seem as if I'm yankin' your chain a bit
Or maybe the way in which I'm sayin' shit
Is playin' with you but ain't shit changing
It's still the same shit and Shady's still a lady killer
Since the day I went insane and then attacked the babysitter
With a potato peeler, and mushed her face into the entertainment center
It's like another plane just entered into Ukraine again
Or the Bermuda Triangle and attempted to make a safe descent
Awaiting anyone who ain't affiliated, it could be danger
Did you make arrangements with the gangsters 'fore you came here?
And if they mention us

Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that (static)
I swear I love my city, I just want less (static)
See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that (static)
Detroit vs. Everybody

What up though, it's the godfather Trick, Trick
You either ridin' with us or gettin' rolled on
That means Detroit vs. Everybody!!
Hey Em, let me get that instrumental take it down to the hood
Let the little homies get this remix crackin'
Detroit! Okay![Verse: Eminem]
You know it's devil's night the way that I smash the face of a punk in
Mask of Jason is a fashion statement since Drunken
Master tapes been a basket case and if that's the case then I'm dunkin'
Fascination with masturbation and humpin'
Lacerations and masking tape and I'm bumpin'
Some Master Ace, roll up posin' as pastor Mase at a lunchin
See Andrea Yates, grab her face then I'm punchin'
Crack her fuckin' skull with an antique vase, kill her husband
To the back of the station wagon, she's dragged and placed in the trunk and
Now I'm wanted for kidnapping, rape, and abduction
Spread her legs like Land O'Lakes  that I'm cutting till every fuckin' limb's either amputated or punctured
Decapitated Christina Applegate and I rap like I'm agitated
No chill but I'm half sedated, a functioning addict, wait I'm in London?
Brains underwear? A pantywaist, classic case of disfunction
Aggravated assault, it was rap related, you activated a gunman
This game's over-saturated with junk and you punks couldn't get a hit from a database with a thumbprint
Razors and matches, path is laid for destruction
Put Jason Mraz's face in his ass then I'm snatchin'
Anne Hathaway, she scratchin' like Jam Master Jay on the one's and
Two's, I slash away then I'm dumpin' her ass in a Lake Placid for Alligators
After I use the fuckin' tire thumper to bash her brains in for nothin'
The murder weapons I stash 'em away on Runyon
Man the kind of balls that it has to take and the gumption
Lack of class displayed but such a vast array in abundance
Of sad disgraceful and bad distasteful redundance
And bitch I'm hung like candy canes if you're wondering
Balls come at you like batting cages, I'm raw like Big Daddy Kane is, I'm coming
Like I'm ejaculating and nutting, come catch the clap like you're patty caking little dumpling
Or brace yourself like a cast and be the last to make an assumption
I'm back
Like I'm in the bathroom taking a dump and it's back in the day or somethin'
I'll shit on you, devil's night, how's that for a introduction?[Verse 1: Eminem]
I roll over and go to reach for you, you're gone
This bed's empty without you
You said you're moving on
But I'm having some trouble getting there
But dwelling ain't getting me, uhh, anywhere
Fuckin' Valentine's Day
Fuck February, stuffed teddy bear, guts everywhere
Machete on the floor, I smashed up every mirror
Yeah, how do I look?
You fuckin' just left me here to die didn't you?
Why didn't you respond yet?
I've written you five or six different times and
I'm gettin' sick and tired of always apologizing to you
I didn't do shit to deserve what you're puttin' me through
This couldn't be true, we can't be over
So violets are blue, roses are red
Why is it everything I do I'm reminded of you?

Saw two white coffins in my dreams last night
I saw my Lord Jesus with his hands pointed toward the light
Saw my old sweetheart she said, "honey, I'm back"
Just so you don't die alone, just so you don't die alone

Guess I gotta deal with the fact that, you ain't never comin' back
Now every woman that I look at I'm lookin' for you
So I'm findin' something the matter with them
Excuse to not see anyone
Useless, rather pick up the phone, not at all, followin' protocol
I get bold like bowling balls
Grow balls and go to call to talk, forget what I want to say
Damnit I'm drawin' blanks like I'm playin' hangman
I'm sick of playin' these games, I can't handle this heartbreak
It's makin' me wanna blow out my brains
Like birthday cake candles
Hang up the phone and I shake, I think I may have made a mistake
Can't escape the madness
Turn the radio on, I hate this sad song
But I can't even change the station
The same one's playin' on eight channels
I lay awake in shambles, I'm startin to hallucinate
I'm havin' all these visions of us at each other's wakes
In caskets and suddenly I wake and that's when I know I


Give me one more, bottle for the pain
Give me one more for the memories
Give me one more, I'll make it taste like a steak
It'll help alleviate
It'll soothe this ache
Of trying to fake
That she's really, she's really coming back

And it's been a while now, but I finally realize how
Much reality sucks, but it's just something about our love
I'm still in denial now, dealing with the finality of
And it's making me crazy thinking of the days we, spent
And how I'll never hold you again
And there ain't shit I can do about it
Now my head is overcrowded
With these clouded memories and I can't seem to get you out it
And how the fuck do you sleep comfortably
Knowing what you done did to me, huh?
Did it even occur to you that I loved you?
Completely, deep, and madly head over heels for you
Was you and me, once used to be together forever
It was supposed to be us, but you crushed the dream
We was supposed to die together, and it's killing me so much
When I sleep I wake up dead, must be why I

They ask me am I okay, they ask me if I'm happy
Are they asking me that because of the shit that's been thrown at me
Or am I just a little snappy and they genuinely care?
Doody, most of my life it's just been me and you there
And I continuously stare at pictures of you
I never got to say I love you as much as I wanted to but I do
Yeah I say it now and you can't hear me, what the fuck good does
That do me now, but somehow I know you're near me in presence
Oh, I went and dropped some presents off for Easter to them
Two little beautiful boys of yours to try to ease their minds a little
And dog you'll never believe this
But Sharonda actually talks to me now, Jesus
And everyone else is just tryna pick up the pieces
Man how could you touch so many fucking lives and just leave us
They say grievance has a way of affecting everyone different
If it's true how the fuck am I supposed to get over you, difficult as it sounds

Doody, I dropped a tear in a rhyme
The day you find it is the day I stop missing DeShaun
Holten, it was written, it was woven for a soldier to leave so suddenly
Got me wide open
How could God take a soul so dope and
Turn around leave us all heartbroken?
Know that you're saying keep going, be a man, no emotion
It's your duty, till we meet again, Doody

Doody, that's what we'd call each other, I don't know where it came from
But it just stuck with us, we was always brothers
Never thought about each other's skin colors
'Til one day we was walking up the block in the summer
It was like 90 degrees I was catching a sunburn
Tryna walk under the trees just to give me some comfort
I'm moaning I just wanna get home when I look over and your shirt is off
I'm like you gonna fry and you're like, "No I won't, I'm black stupid
Black people they got melatonin
In their skin we don’t burn," meanwhile my face is glowing and I felt
Like I'm on fire and the entire time you're just laughing at me
And snapping at me with your shirt, bastard
And I still have to get you back for that shit
And by the way them Playboy rings, my mother stole from you
Well Nate finally got 'em back shit
It musta been at least 16 years ago, well I put 'em in your cask-oww
Moving past it, it still ain't registered yet
But you can bet your legacy they'll never forget
The Motor City, Motown, hip hop vet, Hip Hop Shop, dreads
It don't stop there, yeah, as difficult as it sounds


And this might sound a little strange but I'mma tell it
I found that jacket that you left at my wedding and I picked it up to smell it
I wrapped it up in plastic until I put it in glass
And hang up in the hallway so I can always look at it
And as for all me and D12 we feel like fuck rap
It feels like our general just fucking died in our lap
We shut off all our pagers, all our cell numbers is changed
Our two-ways are in the trash so some cats will have to find a new way
And I know it feels like the dreams will die with you today
But the truth is they're all still here and you ain't
Purple Gang, you gotta keep pressing on
Don't ever give up the dream dog, I got love for you all
And Doody, it's true you bought people together who never
Woulda been in the same room if it wasn't for you
You were the peacemaker Doody, I know sometimes you were moody
But you hated confrontation and truly hated the feuding
But you were down for yours whenever it came to scrapping
If it had to happen, it had to happen, believe me
I know you're the one who taught me to throw them bows back on Dresden
From making cars to paintballing and getting arrested
To sitting across from each other in cells laughing and jesting
They tried to hit us for five years for that, no question
I guess them hookers and bums that we shot up
Didn't show up for court so we got off on a technicality, left sweatin'
Me, you and what's his face, I forgot his fucking name
Shame he even came to your funeral, he betrayed our team
And if I see him again I'mma punch him in the fucking face
And that's on Hallie Jade, Whitney Lane and Alaina's name
I let the pistol bang once just to lick a shot in the air
For you and pour some liquor out for you with Obie in the parking lot
Of 54 just before we were supposed to get in cars
To come and see you, once more difficult as it sounds

Doody![Eminem]
Good morning children!
My name is Dirty Steve, I'll be your substitute teacher for today
(Clinton Sparks!)

Come with me, don't be so mad, angry little man
Dirty Steve will be here soon, he will hold your hand
Walking through the forest, he will show you porno mags
You can beat his dick while he sucks yours, cuz he's a fag[Verse]
Come here spittin' with non written
Non fiction
Rappers try to step to this with no prediction
It doesn't matter cause I'm smashing and bashing and crashing
I hate rappers with a passion when I'm chilling with DJ Fashion
Yo, I need a frickin' Kleenex or I die like River Phoenix
When I'm chilling with Phoenix
With two Coronas I'm on the microphone and I'mma own this
Yo and I'mma bone this
In Arizona
Yo, rappers that ain't able
That can't stay stable
I'm on two turntables
With my man
But he doesn't matter cause he kicks lyrics galore
And he's only 5'4"
Yo check it out, I bust rhymes and get groovy
My man got carded at a rated R movie
But it really didn't matter he wasn't insulted
He said "I'm 27 years old. Yo, I'm an adult kid."
But yo, still
Slim Shady gets ill with the skill
And I'mma always gonna build and kill
My baby's mama just to piss the world off
Just to piss the girl's off
Yo, I hurl off
The top of the building
Kill women and children
And then it hit me
Suddenly my wrist's tried to slit me
Couldn't believe it
Yo, y'all couldn't conceive it
It's Slim Shady
I'll fuck a girl in her cleavage
Bleep that out and you can keep it
Just bleep it
Yo, y'all keep it a secret
I'm top secret
Like Pop Secret
Rappers, they don't wanna see
Slim Shady, I'm from the motherfuckin' D(Ja Rule)
Em you claim your mother's a crackhead and Kim is a known slut

You but the E before the D because that's all you on
You on Pac's dick (bitch) you a replica guy if he were still alive you would never get by
All you do is cry bitch keep it real life is more than imitating niggas and eating pills
And what kind of mothafucker ruins 3 deals that another nigga got you they didn't see skills
And I ain't playing your a brother getting cheated
And Ja Rule be praying on his cover cause he need it
And you niggas hating shut your mouths
It's just the real niggas ain't buying that shit you put out

(Obie)
Doe Rae Me but we don't sing motherfuckers
So Murda Inc do your thing motherfuckers
You unleased on a team who expects nothing less then RnB coming from that regime
Regime is a little extreme neck to neck with soldiers motherfucking marines

Now that you embrace the green don't fuck with the triple beams
You's a muther fucking actor slash Pac impersonating rapper
Slash Billy Holiday how it happen?
Artists with repituares saw him in action, Pac's assasination
Def jam grabbed him, told him reinact him you'll go platinum
They seen it for sure I know that Afeni Shakur don't enjoy Jeffrey Atkins
Reinacting her boy saw him click clacking his toy
Match and destroy Shady slash Aftermath in detroit motherfucker

You niggas can scream, holla and curse and go ahead and respond
Pull that pen and pad up out of your purse

(Proof)
Slim didn't send Proof to get at the wankstas
He told me to let loose and spit at the ganstas
What up gotti were in this little war you pushed on
Put your ear to the ground for stucky and bush stones
What's wrong? didn't think were strong with real niggas
Roll like a boss in the streets they still feel us
This real witness yall ain't caught the concept
You're talking non sense to walking bomb threats
Contacts were blown by Benzetta in the Source
Threatning at the boss you're gonna see me on your porch
Now Irv got the nerse to try serve on us
But Detroit niggas curve and they stirs to bust

(Kuniva)
Do I gotta get my nigga bugz, punks like you get beat up
Stomped unconscience and smacked with the heater
This rap cookie monster gets jabbed in the tonsils
With dicks so much that he should be fixed with a vagina
Who's behind ya? Caddillac, Pac or that transvestite that dress like a Lil Kim Fox
Your just like a little wind box when I press tight on the trigger of this Glock
That's right on the little shit you got left to help you eat
You not Pac's songs without laws will help you sleep
You got shot in your video trying to mock pac your mockavelli get your own identity

Look at what the fuck you done got into
I see you found your niche, you just a bitch with a menstrual
Claimin' you a murderer and you spelled it wrong
You put E before the D cause that's all you on
You on Pac's dick, you a replica guy
If he was still alive you would never get by
All you do is cry, bitch keep it real
Life is more than imitatin' niggas and eatin' pills
And what kind of motherfucker ruins three deals
That another nigga got you, they didn't see skills
And I ain't playin', you a brother gettin' cheated
And Ja Rule be prayin' on his cover cause he need it
And all you niggas hatin', shut you mouths
It's just that real niggas ain't buyin' that shit y'all put out

Doe, rae, me but we don't sing motherfuckas
So Murder Inc do your thing motherfuckers
You unleashed on a team who expects nothin' less
Than R&B comin' from that regime
Regime is a little extreme
Neck and neck with soldiers, motherfuckin' Marines
Ja sold his soul to sing
Weave eye-witness team on the TV screen, chase the greed
Now that you've embraced the green
Don't fuck with the triple beams
You's a motherfuckin' actor, slash Pac impersonatin' rapper
Slash Billie Holiday, how it happen
Artist and repertoire saw him in action
Pac assassination, Def Jam grabbed him

You'll get popped poppin' all that shit you pop

Now we can get past the mean mugs and get to the slugs
To the grievance and the crying and the intimate hugs
We don't take you serious nigga, you shook you half of a half-way crook
Get off X dick, go sing a hook nigga
And you can't replace the late great one
And when you gone you only gon' be the late fake one
Nigga please, stick to the script

And Benzino you ain't shit but a bitch
Fuckin' old-ass ignorant innocent lookin' senior citizen

A bitch-made man
Now how you gonna connect with them short ass arms like a Tyrannosaurus Rex
You niggas can scream holler and curse
Go ahead and respond and pull that pen and pad up outta your purse

Slim didn't send Proof to get at the wankstas
He told me to let loose and spit at the gangstas
What up Gotti, and this little war you pushed on
Put your ear to the ground for stepping on bush stones
What's wrong, didn't think we strong with real niggas
Roll like a boss in the streets they still feel us
It's real business y'all ain't caught the concept
You talkin' nonsense to walking bomb threats
Contact was blown by Benzetta in The Source
Threaten at the boss you gon' see me on your porch
Now Irv got the nerve to try to serve on us
But Detroit niggas early and ain't scurred to bust

Word to my nigga Bugz, punks like you get beat up
Stomped unconscious and smacked with the heater
This rap cookie monster gets jabbed in the tonsils
With dicks so much that he should be fixed with a vagina
Who's behind you
Cadillac Pac or that transvestite
That dress like a Lil Kim fox
You're just like a little windbox
Press tight on the trigger of this Glock
Swallow that little shit you got left to help you eat
You knock Pac's songs without love to help you sleep
You got shot in your video trying mock Pac

Obie Trice, D-12, G Unit, 50 Cent
Hailie Jade

Daddy, is Ja Rule taller than me?

No honey, you guys are the same size(Ed. Note: Please help finish transcribing.)

Livin' like a sleuth
...

But don't chew with your mouth full
Don't chew with your mouth full
Cause if you chew with your mouth full
You'll end up biting your toes

...
Tossin' curves that are nerve-wrackin'
Which is trickery, victory's repetitious
Though weaker ones and overeager ones that just get ate up
Though many will often try to duplicate the style I made up
If my weight up it wouldn't matter, you're slow as a paraplegic
Whoops you missed, here's my fist, eat it


...
Frostbite

...


...
When will he ever learn?
I guess never[Verse 1]
Used to get bent, now I represent to the fullest
Pencil is full of insolent bullets
I'm like a Doberman Pinscher, Pitbull and a Rott'
Mixed with a toxic, the plot begins to thicken
I begin to spitting like vintage Pac, demented
Demonic sinister, ever since the the Doc replenished me
The day he gave me that shot when I was just 'bout to quit
So to not see him with me would be a shocking image
And I'm the definition of what a concrete chin is
Cause no matter how many times you sock me in it
And knock me to the canvas, even the boxing critics
Know that if I get off to a rocky start, I'll always have a Rocky finish
Eat me brocoli, spinach, cocky? Nope
But I hope I offended you when I told ya how dope I am at this
And put emphasis on the "dope," so when names come up
In that conversation of who's the dopest, better throw mine in it
And don't mind me, while I remind you of the flow
You won't find anywhere, when it fires and I unload my pen explodes
'til there's no rhymes in it, reload in no time
Let insults fly every sixty seconds that go by, so you know I meant it
In school I was so shy, timid
Two pairs of jeans I'd alternate, bummy clothes, I 'member
Begging my mom for K-Mart MacGregors cause they were new
St. Vincent de Paul, those Pony's were used, and no size fitted
But kissed them old days, adios, I did it
They said I was a gimmick, now I'm the one that those guys mimic
Now you fuckers don't wanna go starting no argument
Cause you know I'll win it, name a flow that's more authentic, and don't front

You know I got you open, kid, don't front
You know I got you open, word, don't front
You know I got you open, kid, yo why you fronting?
You know I got you open, kid

Rest in peace to Big Proof, you was a beast, you lyrically mirrored me
Molded my flow off of you, your spirit's flowing through me
I love you, Doody, without you I feel so incomplete
I'm no king, no need for rose petals to be thrown at my feet
I'm a thorn in your side, get thrown into a throne
Better watch the fucking tone that you speak
Feel like I'm in the zone, I'm in a whole different league
On my mothafuckin' own, it's just me
No opponents can compete, and I've never been known to retreat
From beef, be beat, follow trends or wallow in defeat
I'm still hungry as fuck, but can't even say bon appétit
Cause I don't know what to eat, fucking microphone or the beat
Bitch, nobody's mind works like mine
It's nose to the grindstone time, holmes, your mind's blown
Cause I rhyme like I'm still trying to get signed, up in the Ebony Show-
-case with Denaun screaming "Who the fuck passed you the mic?"
Never asked you like my shit from the get
I'd rather ask you to wipe my ass, bitch
You had you a nice run, now take a hike
I ever meet my match, I'mma strike that bitch first
Cause on the mic I gotta represent the real rappers
The real rappers get their mothafuckin' skills cracking
Word to Buckshot and Dru-Ha, why the fuck not?
You don't like it? Suck a cock! Almost forgot
Before I signed with the Doc, I almost signed with Duck Down
Cause Rawkus didn't make no offers, so mothafuck Loud
They jerked me around so what's up now?
Wow, how much of an asshole would I sound like
Rubbing it and holding some grudge now, but don't front

You know I got you open, kid, don't front
You know I got you open, word, don't front
You know I got you open, kid, yo why you fronting?
You know I got you open, kid

Late at night, used to catch a buzz, couldn't write
Now I write the type of shit to make you wipe
But wear diapers cause you might leave a streak
I'm on a streak windshield wipers couldn't wipe
It's hard to decipher what cypher I might jump into tonight
Cause I'm hyper or something, needing someone or something is lighting
This fire under me, it's breathing new life, it's like I already died once
I guess some people only live twice, and it's funny
My days of being broke was so long ago, I lost all concept of money
But you dimes won't get a fucking nickle from me
Oh shit, I'm down on one knee
I'm having a stroke of genius, Elizabeth I'm coming to you, honey
From boy to man, and still make a whore moan like a thyroid gland
I'm in another category, man, don't put me up with them pop stars
I never needed a pat on the back to get at a boy, band
No offense? Yes offense, precedents has been set that'll never get met
Middle finger pressed against Moby's nose
Shouts to Obie, the curtains closed on my show
(But never forget that I'm the one you thought wouldn't make it)
You can't take it, oh
Got a whole generation of rappers coming up that are nutty with the flow
But convince me you've heard
An MC since me who's as good with the fucking mincing of words
Without mincing words that'll make you feel like I'm pinching a nerve
Whose mentally disturbed, you might as well stick a knife in me and turn
It'll be like my skin being Indian burned
Hah, bitch there isn't one, when will you learn?
Never been served if memory serves
I'd battle that 'til my own recollection remembers these words

You know I got you open kid, stop fronting
You know I got you open, Word Life[Eminem] Obie yo

That's why I ain't got no time
For these games and stupid tricks
All these bitches on my dick
That's how dudes be getting sick
That's how dicks be getting drips
Falling victims to this shit
From these bitches on our dicks
Fucking chickens with no ribs
That's why I ain't got no time

Yo, I woke up, fucked up off the liquor I drunk
I hadda bag of the skunk, one and last night's tunk
Pussy residue was on my penis, Denise, from the cleaners
Fucked me good, you should've seen us
Big booty bitch, switch unbearable
French role styling, body like a stallion
Sizing up the figure, while my shit gettin' bigger
Debating on to fuck her, do I wanna be her nigga
Caressing this bitch, plus I'm checking out them tits
Sipping on that fine shit, I ain't use to buying
I gotta hit it from behind, it's mandatory
Like taking ho's money, but that's another story
For surely your pussy on toast, after we toast
Our clothes fell like Bishop in juice
The womb beater, clean pussy eater, inserting my jock
In that spot hotter than the hottest block, don't stop
Response I got when I was knocking it
Clocks steading ticking, kinky finger licking
And carrying on, semen at my tip when she moans
I gotta slow down before I cum soon
And work that nigga, like a slave owner
When I dropped off my outfit, she knew I wanted to bone her
She foaming at the lips, the ones between the hips
Pubic hair's looking like some sour cream dip
Without the nacho, my dick hit the spot though
Pussy tighter than conditions of us black folks
We in the final stretch, the last part of sex
I bust a fat ass nut then I woke up next
Like, what the fuck is going on here?
This bitch evaporated, pussy and all just picked up and vacated
And now I'm frustrated cause my dick was unprotected
And doctor Wesley telling me I really got that shit, fuck


Now I don't wanna hit no women but this chicks got it coming
Someone better get this bitch before she gets kicked in the stomach
And she's pregnant, but she's egging me on, begging me to throw her
Off the steps on this porch, my only weapon is force
And I don't wanna resort to violence of any sort
But whys she shoving me for doesn't she love me no more?
Wasn't she hugging me four minutes ago at the door?
Man I'm this close to going toe to toe with this whore
What would you do if she was telling you she wants a divorce
She's having another baby in a month and it's yours
And you found it isn't cause this bitch has been visiting
Someone else and sucking his dick and kissing you on the lips
When you get back to Michigan, now the plot has thickened 'n worse
Cause you feel like you've been sticking your fucking dick in a hearse
So you're paranoid at every little cold that you get
Ever since they sold you this shit, you've been holding your dick
So you go to the clinic, sweating every minute you're in it
Then the doctor comes out looking like Dennis the Menace
And it's obvious to everyone in the lobby, it's AIDS
He ain't even gotta to call in you the office to say it
So you jet back home, cause you gone get that ho
When you see her, you're gonna bend her fucking neck back yo
Cause you love her, you never would've expect that blow
Obie told you the scoop, how could she stoop that low?
Jesus, I don't believe this bitch works at the cleaner's
Bringing me home diseases swinging from Obie's penis
She's so deceiving, shit this ho's a genius, she geed us


I'm busy, yeah, fuck these bitches
Fuck em all, get money
Ha, Shady Records
Wow, Obie Trice
Eminem mother fucker
New millennium shit, yeah
Turn this shit off, turn this shit the fuck offWhat I wanna do, let me see right here, yo

Not many people that I label
Would be able to display table
Manners but my plan this
To make this beat rock like scanners
And make the fans just go bananas
Yo, get our Planters
That means our nuts for the sluts who don't understand this
Yo, my clan is
Yeah right, and y'all gon' stand there
And act like you don't understand it
Like my name is Janet, my titty fell out and I ain't plan it
Check, check this out
And if you're rockin' with your necklace out
That's my breakfast now
I'mma snatch it, yo my style is rechid, you can't fetch it
No you can't stretch it
And yo, it doesn't really matter
Cause your name I can't even pronunciate
You're the sa-same type-a mo'fucker
To go and suckerpunch Dre at the Vibe Awards
But he right behind the boards the next day
So, kiss an ass
Or kiss a dick, lick a dick
Eat my ass
Whatever you wan' do, it's on you
Big Proof comin' through..[Intro]
Yeah boy, them better ring the alarm, boy
Them know what's coming, boy
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh my God, fucking bumbaclot, I'm hard as Kenard
The little boy who shot Omar in the Wire
Tie a whore up with barbed wire, you're nothin' but a brah, boy
I'm the real deal and charbroiler on the bonfire
And bon voyage, bitch I'm like Chef Boyardee
In this bitch, send a bomb to my mom's lawyer
I'm a problem for you, boy you think you're Tom Sawyer
Til I pull you out the fuckin' storybook and stomp on you
Fuckin' fictional characters and fairy tales
Prepare yourselves for Captain America on ferris wheels
But it ain't fiction, it's fact boy, beware, it's real
Them lyrics you wield equal zero to a hero's shield
Mr. Fly-by-the-seat-of-his-pants para-sail
Or hit the trampoline, bounce, and grap a pair of stilts
And I ain't wearing zilch, zip, zero, nothin', no, nada
Like your father fucking your mother

(Drop the bomb on 'em)
Please don't drop the bomb on me, Shady
Shady, please don't drop the bomb on me
(Drop the bomb on 'em)
I don't want no dog-gone beef, see
Ain't no reason to sick the dogs on me

Boy, I'm the real McCoy, you little boys can't even fill voids
Party's over, kids kill the noise, here come the killjoys
Me and Dre, the steel alloys, the rap crown royals
That scalp cowboys, now how that sound for you?
Yeah, boy, you know we're 'bout to put it down for you
So kick your shoes off and before you have a sound voyage
Sayonara, see you fuckers tomorrow
Get some R&R and marinate in some marinara
And have a coke and a smile, don't make me open a jar of
Whip-ass on you, that's the last straw you're hopin' to draw
Yeah, you're fresher than most, boy, I'm just doper than all
Boy, I'm that boy boy, them boys, them no up to par
I just show up, go up to the stage and blow up the spot
There ain't no boy who can do what I do, boy, I'm a star
Boy, I told you, boy, I'm a soldier boy, I'm Deshaun
Holton in this bitch, I'm the Proof, boy, you're a fraud
I'll destroy you, boy, fuck around and blow you to sod
Oh my God boy, you didn't go there, boy, you did not
I got a whole storyboard for you, boy, you're the plot
You're gettin' got whether you try to avoid it or not
Apology not accepted, boy, Detroit is a rock
We get to beefin' ain't no tellin' at what point it'll stop
All I got to do is point to the spot, when the bomb drops
Boy, does it drop, and when it does, boy, there's a problem


Boy, don't jinx yourself, boy, I'm Micheal Spinks with the belt
Stringer Bell, boy, my name rings bells for itself
I'm sick as hell, boy, you better run and tell someone else
Bringin' hell, boy, sing them telegrams and get dealt
And to that boy on them sedative meds who said he was better
I bet he never seen Freddy in a black and red little sweater
Back better than ever, the cheddar shredder
The grater, the beef grinder, I'll settle vendettas a little later
Givin' haters incubators, think you made a mistake
By sayin' Shady was ghost, I ain't even close to the gate
You got one foot in the grave, just stay put and behave
I'm 'bout to turn this fuckin' place to Beirut in a day
So, hey, wouldn't you say I'm the shit? couldn't agree
With you more if you were to say that my fuckin' shit doesn't stink
Shady fucking Aftermath, boy, the ship doesn't sink
It just floats in the fuckin' water 'til we fill up the tank

Yeah, haha, whoo, shit
(Aight, guess what?
I ain't coming in yet, I'll come in a minute
Ayo, this is my love song, it goes like this)

Back when Mark Walhberg was Marky Mark (fucking faggot)
This is how we used to make the party start
We used to mix Hen with Bacardi Dark
And when it, kicks in you can hardly talk
And by the, sixth gin you're gon' probably crawl
And you'll be, sick then and you'll probably barf
And my pre-diction is you're gon' probably fall
Either somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall
And every-thing's spinnin', you're beginnin' to think women
Are swimmin' in pink linen again in the sink
Then in a couple of minutes that bottle of Guinness is finished
You are now allowed to officially slap bitches
You have the right to remain violent and start wilin'
Start a fight with the same guy that was smart eyein' you
Get in your car, start it, and start drivin'
Over the island and cause a 42-car pile-up
(Earth calling, pilot to co-pilot
Looking for life on this planet sir, no sign of it
All I can see is a bunch of smoke flyin'
And I'm so high that I might die if I go by it
Let me outta this place, I'm outta place
I'm in outer space, I've just vanished without a trace
I'm going to a pretty place now where the flowers grow
I'll be back in an hour or so)

Cause every time I go to try to leave
Somethin' keeps pullin' on my sleeve
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay
These drugs really got a hold of me
Cause every time I try to tell 'em "no"
They won't let me ever let 'em go
I'm a sucker all I gotta say
These drugs really got a hold of me

In third grade, all I used to do
Was sniff glue through a tube and play Rubik's Cube
Seventeen years later I'm as Rude as Jude
Schemin' on the first chick with the hugest boobs
I've got no game, and every face looks the same
They've got no name, so I don't need game to play
I just say whatever I want to whoever I want
Whenever I want, wherever I want, however I want
However, I do show some respect to few
This ecstasy's, got me standin' next to you
Getting sentimental as fuck, spillin' guts to you
We just met, but I think I'm in love with you
But you're on it too, so you tell me you love me too
Wake up in the mornin' like "Yo, what the fuck we do?"
I gotta go bitch, you know I got stuff to do
Cause if I get caught cheatin' then I'm stuck with you
But in the long run, these drugs are probably going
To catch up sooner or later but fuck it, I'm on one
So let's enjoy, let the X destroy your spinal cord
So it's not a straight line no more
'til we walk around looking like some wind-up dolls
Shit's stickin' outta our backs like a dinosaur
Shit, six hits won't even get me high no more
So bye for now, I'm goin' to try to find some more


That's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow
When you swallow it all wallow and drown in your sorrow
And tomorrow you're probably gonna wanna do it again
What's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend? Screw it
And what's a little bit of alcohol poisoning?
And what's a little fight? Tomorrow you'll be boys again
It's your life, live it however you wanna
Mar-a-ju-on-na is everywhere, where was you brought up?
It don't matter as long as you get where you're goin'
Cause none of this shit's gonna mean shit where we're goin'
They tell you to stop, but you just sit there ignorin'
Even though you wake up feelin' like shit every mornin'
But you're young, you've got a lot of drugs to do
Girls to screw, parties to crash, sucks to be you
If I could take it all back now, I wouldn't
I would have did more shit that people said that I shouldn't
But I'm all grown up now and upgraded
And graduated to better drugs and updated
But I still got a lotta growin' up to do
I still got a whole lotta throwin' up to spew
But when it's all said and done I'll be 40
Before I know it with a 40 on the porch tellin' stories
With a bottle of Jack, two grandkids in my lap
Babysitting for Hailie while Hailie's out gettin' smashed

"Morning, Marshall."

"Morning, doc."

"So we're discharging you today, how are you feeling?"

"Anxious."

"Anxiety?"

"Well, anxious to get home, anxious to get back into the world. Nervous."

"Nervous? C'mon, Marshall, you're a big boy now. Sounding like a bit of a baby, you can do this. You found a sponsor yet?"

"Um, not yet. I mean, but when I get back"

"Well, if you find one, you find one. If you don't, you don't."

"Well, yeah, I mean I gotta start going to meetings first and... Wait, what?"

"Well, you don't absolutely have to go to meetings and it's not like like a requirement that they fit into your schedule, we know you're a busy person."

"But I thought sobriety was the most important thing?"

"So what else are you thinking?"

"Um, well, I know I gotta start practicing the steps, and I mean learning them, and start being able to apply them."

"Steps?"

"Yeah, steps."

"There's a lot of them, aren't there?

"Well, twelve."

"Christ, I don't even know them all."

"Really?"

"Anything else?"

"Um, well, I mean the only other question I have was like, what do I do if I find myself in a situation where maybe somebody is drinking around me or something like that and I get tempted to—"

"Take a drink."

"What?"

"Take a drink and y'know, take the edge off."

"Take the edge off? Man, if I ever take a drink I already know what that's gonna lead me to."

"What, you mean these?" *shakes pills*

"Man, what the fuck?!"

"Marshall, what's the matter, darling? Having some doubts are we? Marshall, you can't leave me, you'll never leave me, Marshall. We'll always be together, Marshall. Marshall...? Marshall!?

"No, no, no, no, NO!"
*Alarm beeps*
"Oh shit!""Morning, Marshall."
"Morning, doc."
"So we're discharging you today, how are you feeling?"
"Anxious."
"Anxiety?"
"Well, anxious to get home, anxious to get back into the world. Nervous."
"Nervous? C'mon, Marshall, you're a big boy now. Sounding like a bit of a baby, you can do this. You found a sponsor yet?"

"What, you mean these?" *shakes pills*
"Now, what the fuck!?"
"Marhsall, what's the matter, darling? Having some doubts, are we?"
"Oh, no, no, no, come on, man!"
"Marshall, you can't leave me..."
"Oh, FUCK YOU, man!"
"....you'll never leave me, Marshall."
"NO!"
"We'll always be together, Marshall."
"NO! NO!!!"
"Marshall...? Marshall!?"
"NOOOOO!!!!!"
"Oh, shit..."[Verse 1 - Eminem]
They ask me am I ok
They ask me if I'm happy
Are they asking me that because of the
Shit that's been thrown at me
Or am I just a little snappy
And they genuinely care
Dudey, most of my life its just
Been me and you there
And I continuously stare at pictures of you
I never got to say I love you as much
As I wanted to but I do
Yeah, I say it now and you can't hear me
What the fuck good does that do me now
But somehow I know you're near me in presence
Oh I went and drop some presents off to ease it to them
Two little beautiful boys of
Yours to try to ease their minds a little
And dawg you'll never believe this
But Sharonda actually talks to me now
Jesus and everyone else is
Just tryna' pick up the pieces
Man how you touch so many
Fucking lives and just leave us
They say grievance has a way of
Affecting everyone different
If it's true, how the fuck am I
Supposed to get over you
Difficult as it sounds...

Dudey
I drop a tear in the rhyme
The day you find it is the day I stop missing DeShaun
Holton. It was written it was woven
For a soldier to leave so suddenly got me wide open
How can God take a soul so dope and
Turn around and leave us all heart broken?
Know that you saying keep going
Be a man no emotion it's your duty 'till we meet again
Dudey

Dudey, that's what we call each other
I don't know where it
Came from but it just stuck with us
We was always brothers
Never thought about each others' skin colours
'Til one day we was walking up the
Block in the summer
It was like 90 degrees
I was catching a sun burn
Tryna' walk under the trees
Just to give me some comfort
I'm moaning I just wanna get home
When I look over and your shirt is off
I'm like you gonna fry and like
"No I won't, I'm black stupid
And black people they got melatonin
In their skin, we don't burn"
Meanwhile, my face is glowing and I felt
Like I'm on fire
And the entire time you're just laughing at me
And snapping at me with your shirt, bastard
And I still have to get you back for that shit
And by the way them playboy rings
My mother stole from you
Well Nate finally got em back
Shit it must have been at least 16 years ago
Well I put em in your cask-ahhh
Moving past it, it
Still ain't registered yet
But you can bet, your legacy
They'll never forget
The motor city motown
Hip hop vet, hip hop shop, dreads
It don't stop there
Yeah, as difficult as it sounds...

Dudey
I drop a tear in the rhyme
The day you find it is the day I stop missing DeShaun
Holton. It was written it was woven
For a soldier to leave so suddenly got me wide open
How can God take a soul so dope and
Turn around and leave us all heart broken?
Know that you saying keep going
Be a man no emotion it's your duty 'till we meet again
Dudey

And this may sound a
Little strange but I'mma tell it
I found that jacket
That you left at my wedding
And I picked it up to smell it
I wrapped it up in plastic
Until I put it in glass
And hang it up in the
Hallway so I can always look at it
And as for all of me and D12 we feel like fuck rap
It feels like our General
Just fucking died in our lap
We shut off all our pages
All our cell numbers has changed
Our two-ways are in the trash
So some cats will have to find a new way
And I know that it feels like
The dreams will die with you today
But the truth is there
All still here and you ain't
Purple Gang, you gotta keep pressing on
Don't ever give up the dream dawg
I got love for you all
And Dudey, it's true you
Bought people together who never
Would'a been in the same
Room if it wasn't for you
You were the peacemaker Dudey
I know sometimes you were moody
But you hated confrontation
And truly hated the feuding
But you were down for yours
Whenever it came to scrapping
If it had to happen, it had to happen
Believe me, I know you're the one who taught me to
Throw them balls back on Dresden
From making cars to paintballing
Getting arrested
To sitting across from each other
In cells laughing and jesting
They tried to hit us for 5 years for that, no question
I guess them hookers and bums that we shot up
Didn't show up for court
So we got off on a technicality, left sweating
Me, you and what's his face
I forgot his fucking name
Shame he even came to your funeral
He betrayed our team
And if I see him again
I'mma punch him in the fucking face
And that's on Hallie Jade, Whitney Lane and Alaina's name
I let the pistol bang once
Just to lick a shot in the air
For you and pour some liquor
Out for you with Obie in the parking lot, of 54
Just before we were
Supposed to get in cars
To come and see you once more
Difficult as it sounds...

Dudey[Intro: Eminem]
Ayo, yo, this is motherfucking Eminem... Dirty Dozen
'Bout to show you how we set it when we come through
Know what I'm saying, word up, bitch motherfuckers better raise up
Y'all motherfuckers better raise up... ayo buss it

I'm a pitbull terrier, triple darin' ya, scarin' ya with a derringer
Ready to make you wet like a submariner, tearin' ya frame out with homicidal lines
Bringing the drama and the trauma to ya mama's vital signs
A verbal shot fired, this mics been hot wired, uppercuts to your chin knocking your snot skyward
Rappers wanna be screenplay actors, so Im givin them spine fractures
Like linebackers on the Green Bay Packers, an roll over em backwards
Dirty Dozen, Im someone you just dont wanna see like a nerdy cousin
So keep your distance when I get this tense, you see my fist clench
Its gonna be some bullets dispensed,you besta keep yo premescence fixed
Your mistense,any resistance,get you voided like misprints
Youll end up with no teeth left makin a beef threat
When I look up on your set,dont get it twisted like Keith Sweat

When I get the bussin', you best be get to jumpin'
I'm touchin' somethin, fool I'm comin through dumpin'
My beat's bumpin', you hear it thumpin', that oughta tell you somethin'
Bitch Im comin through dumpin
Bullets hit you, your heart stops pumpin', you blood starts clumpin'
I'm comin' through dumpin'
If you dont know you best make an assumption, I got you slumpin'
Fool I'm comin' through dumpin'

A proven fact my pact got your whole team movin' back
We never losin slack, I paid dues in rap
I'm runnin 'til my shoes are tapped
My writers use them gats, my thugs fuse them cracks
Relax an catch a contact, to an amusin track, slugs dispatched
Slugs dispatch, on any street riz and mismatch
My teamll get busy like rednecks on some 6 packs
My fist crack the featherweight, my wordsll never break
A clever snakell be forever fake, let me get this cheddar straight
Makin dough is a part, so is the heart, my flow is the art
Me an the mic Gomez like Lois & Clark
Weapons concealed until death, now see em, my chrome shatter bones that lack calcium
Knockin domes out the ballpark, your dawgs is all bark, plus you got a small heart
Now save them corny lines for Hallmark
I wanna the sunny days & money paid in they figures
A microphone fiend an on my own team theres fake niggas
Mums they rocked the cradle, I spot the fable
They made the shop an stable, with grass top the table
The Glock enable when I pop the fatal, phonies that I plot prenatal wax
The player haters never make it back
Im dumpin'

When I get the bussin', you best be get to jumpin'
I'm touchin' somethin, fool I'm comin through dumpin'
My beat's bumpin', you hear it thumpin', that oughta tell you somethin'
Bitch Im comin through dumpin
Bullets hit you, your heart stops pumpin', you blood starts clumpin'
I'm comin' through dumpin'
If you dont know you best make an assumption, I got you slumpin'
Fool I'm comin' through dumpin'

Aiyo we don't say that, we say it's real business
The third nigga on the mic, representing world'afanompolous
Ain't shit stoppin us, old school like cold crush
Slicing dice, emcee's on the mic like cold cuts
Blaw make the record, coming straight from the get (oh)
Where niggas keep it real, n make these skills pay there dedts
I can't forget the DJ he'll play we say, focus on the shit that make the crowd wanna flip
We don't bust clips cause it's not in us, but when shit get deep it's a must that we bust
Arm n leg, leg, arm n head, for afros and facing bone heads always down to the dreads
40's to drink endos to smoke, n the rims that we ride on is true deez spokes
Tires, know alot of micheals but they don't live on myers
Bitches pussy tight, here come the dick flyers
What's my name? homie sire
Gon ride on the mic like titty dances on the fire

When you hear my beat, see the crowd starts jumpin, yee, ha-ha-ha yee I'm comin threw dumpin' (word)
Other emcees like dougie fresh ain't saying nuthing, bitch nigga I'm comin threw dumpin'
Go to the church n have the dick n cold humpin, word up, I'm comin threw dumpin'

When I'm lifted don't quizz this, it ain't worth it to risk it
I quick with the gift, n twice as swift with the biscuit
Headed back to ship off all the niggas ass around christmas
They know it's the time of year, they be expecting my visits
Doin 90 on the henzel, runnin to get it, n twizt u niggas like a pretzel
Blows come in three like the godfather trilogy, I'm micheal corleone with this mic, bitch u ain't killin me
Let me see some hands to make sure y'all feeling me
I'm stickin you up for your rocks and y'all gon give em up wilingly
Rap is my life n that's why every day I live it, punches holes in the floor
Like wack rappers records, man every nigga in here is bringin in drama this big
Then they time to come up shorter then bloods all midgits, shiiiit

Can you dig it, kyu coming threw with something
Guarentee to make ya whole fuckin block jumpin' comin threw dumpin'
When we come, we got your knees cumblin, y'all niggas ain't sayin nothing
Cause we comin dumpin'
What you talkin? nigga get to walkin, see your bitch ass crew walkin, we gon get to dumpin'
You don't want it, while headin back up off it, I'm a tell you how it is, nigga cause we dumpin'[Chorus]
Oh, all around the World
There's an echo
As he takes a bow
And they all know all the girls, the boys
They chase the noise
Through the highs and through the lows
They will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo
They will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo

Classical poems
Battle my own demons
I need a glass of Patron
Bad as I need a horn
Stabbing my clavicle bone
I'm at it or prone
First time I seen a dessert eagle
I was letting the 44 buss
The 44 pop
First time you seen one, you was eating coco puffs
Looking at Robocop
I'm not a man, I'm a logo, I'm sustain
In order to clean my things you need saline
I'm never referring to the solution
I'm talking about more like the mustang vroom
Get respect from the get-go, hello
Set to the echo, pyscho
Pen got a mind of its own, gotta write my rhymes with a timer otherwise
I'll probably vibe out to a nine minute song
As the echo follows the Maserati
As the petrol swallows
I'm a thousand bodies away from a skeleton
Check your bible inside it, it will say this guys an elephant
I'm fly like I'm, killing the scene like I'm a villain with wings
I'll sleep when I'm 6 feet deep
Right now I'm living a dream
Though we may be reckless
The ladies check us
They whisper Shady records
Baby echo

Oh, all around the World
There's an echo
As he takes a bow
And they all know all the girls, the boys
They chase the noise
Through the highs and through the lows
They will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo
They will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo

I can hear them calling, calling, calling, calling, calling
I eat rappers with the rhyme, consume 'em
The only fucking thing that you consume is time
I'm super human, my world is like a Rubiks cube
Its too complex girl, you assuming, cupids looming
My mentality's caveman stupid woman
My life is Truman show, all I have is music hoe
I stopped chasing every chick under the sun many moons ago
So pretend my dick is a balloon and blow
Cause you better put a fork in it if you think I'mma lay here just spooning yo
Oh you think you the shit cause I just said you was beautiful
Diabolical, till the last molecule, down to my last hair follicle and cuticle
Rotten to the core, to the bunghole all the way down...
To my sock and the hair on my toe
Learn how to sew, so shut my own booty hole
Cause I ain't took no shit since I looked down to my nuts and saw my first pubic grow
I told these stupid hoes when I come back I'mma set this bitch on fire
And this time I mean Imma pour gasoline on some chick and light her
Cause this time muthafuckers I'm put my whole God-damn dick inside her
I ain't even put my tip in that hoe yet
I'ma go get TIP and try to rip it wider

Oh, all around the World
There's an echo
As he takes a bow
And they all know all the girls, the boys
They chase the noise
Through the highs and through the lows
They will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo
They will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo[Intro]
All aboard, okay, next stop, my basement
I'll meet you down there

There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with, my friend Proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He said what If you went platinum, I'd just laugh at him
That's not happening, that I can't fathom
Eighty something million records worldwide later
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator

Haters getting mad, they done had enough of Shady
You slay me, nothing you say matters enough to touché me
Rappers try to play me, they use Hailie as a ukulele
Woopsa that a fucking daisy
That's a no-no who even she knows dada's fucking crazy
Fucking animal, cuckoo, bananas fuckin' - A, B
Maybe it's because I never had a mother raise me
Fuck around and throw a baby at another baby
You may think it's cause of the way that I was brought up
But it's all caught up to me now, karmas in the waters
Every line I ever said has got me in a corner
You might think it doesn't creep upon ya, but it all does
You wouldn't listen man, I tried to warn ya when you started
Now your brain's all haunted cause of all the shit you thought of
Chainsaw slaughters turn your daughters into sawdust
I never thought it'd come to this, I ought to just be honest but

There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with, my friend Proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He said what If you went platinum, I'd just laugh at him
That's not happening, that I can't fathom
Eighty something million records worldwide later
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator

"Sorry Lance, Mr. Lambert, and Aiken ain't gonna make it
They get so mad, when I call them both faggots"
All these fucking voices in my head I can't take it
Someone shut that fucking baby up, 'for I shake it
You're standing adjacent to Jason slash Leatherface and
Together makes 'em, a fucking bad combination
I lashed at the doctor in my last operation
Shoved the Wiener Schnitzel up his ass, hopped away some-
-body please stop the patient, get the cops to mace him
Homie, I'm the Scheiße, pass Doctor Dre some
I can't leave the game, I just can't walk away son
No not-a now, not a chance, not today son
I can't believe I leave for one brief second
And you pussies queef all over the rap game, naked
And use a leaf to wipe up the crap stains, feck it
I just keep saying the same exact saying, check it

There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with, my friend Proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He said what If you went platinum, I'd just laugh at him
That's not happening, that I can't fathom
Eighty something million records worldwide later
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator

Elevator in my house, I'll smell ya later
I blew the fuck up, a hamster in a microwave
I, think about an escalator now, steps, I hate 'em
Told the neighbor step away, then I just pepper sprayed 'em
Yeah, for every time you ride down the street
Or hideout, drive by my house and beep
Like now mothafucka, try now to sleep
Lie down fucker, try counting sheep
And you're tryna find out, why now there's beef?
Mace in your face bitch, cry now pussy
This is my house, all nine thousand feet
So you can suck my dick with Amy Winehouse's teeth
Then I shove 'em in the elevator, take 'em to the top
Stand above em, just to cut the fucking cable, let 'em drop
Walk an hour to the damn refrigerator, get a pop
While I let 'em fall all the way to the basement yelling stop!

There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with, my friend Proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He said what If you went platinum, I'd just laugh at him
That's not happening, that I can't fathom
Eighty something million records worldwide later
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator

Fucking son of a bitch, I can't believe this shit
This must be all that there is, this must be it
Fucking A, even got a bidet
Wash my ass after I shit with gold toilet paper
Dishwasher's so big, when I'm pissed off
I can just toss a flying saucer in it
This shit's awesome, yeah, fucking elevator
Living in a house with a fucking elevator[Intro]
Oskar Mike dot com

So I'm guessin' there's questions that need addressin', huh?
Like how we fresh in our adolescence and wreckin' 'em
Hand'em tracks, he destined to make a mess of 'em
Snappin' necks and records in matter of seconds check 'em son
Lost an erection and found it in an aggressive nun
Fuckin' chin-checkin' punks 'til he's outta breath and done
No FX, in these doper than sess sessions son
Chillin' for a while on a pile of the rest of 'em
Let the crowd choose who can fuckin' last longer
It's the rap monger, rap monster Earl Sweat attack, conquer
Lose least, niggas lost like the last blanca chica
That we picked up at the last concert
Please, get out ya seat, get out ya seat, verses written with scalpels
He's the junior king standin' out shoutin' on the balcony
How come he's not in counselin'? Fucka's loud while he's sound asleep
Heard he was dope as Sour D, nigga was Courage cowardly?
Stay Gold, alchemy, nigga we rap's Alpha Team
Mr. Teen and Mr. T with a mouth full of powder
And a nose full of chowder, he's choppin' up all the doubters see
Now watch him count the bodies like bitches be countin' calories

Tell the critics I'm back and coming to spit it back in abundance
Hit a fag with onions and split a bag of Funyuns
Mad at me understandable, cannibal shoot an animal out of a cannon and have him catapult at an adult!
Captain of a cult, with an elite following to turn Halloween back into a trick or treat holiday
Have Micheal Myers looking like a liar, swipe his powers
Replace his knife with flowers and a stack of fliers
Hit Jason Vorhees with a 40
Stuck a suppository up his ass and made him tell me a story
Gave Hannibal Lecter a fucking nectarine sat him in a fucking fruit and vegetable section and gave him a lecture
Walked up Elm street with a fucking wiffle bat drew fought Freddy Krueger and Edward Scissor Hands too
Came out with a little scratch, ooh
Looking like I got in a fucking pillow fight with a triple fat goose
Insanity, can it be vanity, where is the humanity
And having a twisted fantasy with an arm and leg amputee
Straight jacket with a hundred eight brackets
With a strap that wraps twice around my back then they latch it
Cut your fucking head off and ask you where you're headed off to
Get it? Headed off to
Medic this headache's awful
This aesthetic is pathetic so is this diabetic waffle
And this prosthetic arm keeps crushing my hard taco

Fuck with the Wolves, we startin' to bark viciously
Catch us in a pile of bodies where dead bitches be
Box Logo hoodies and goodies from buddies that understand
That Bastard was buzzin' like Woody so we get it for free
Had to duct tape the mother goose the mask was off
I stumbled down a hill then I had Jill jack me off
Harder than my dick when Taylor Swift is in my basement
Cause I've been doin' this since Pooh fucked Christopher Robin
Wolf Gang knitted on my cotton like some smelly
Dirty rotten nigger picked it from a cotton gin
Do not give a fuck I've got the swagger of a virgin's dick
But if I did it would be bigger than Earl's upper lip
Sip sizzurp, Supreme on my shizzirt
I munch a bunch of tacos with Waverly's favorite wizard
The favourite nigger turned into Freddy Krueger
And this that raw shit, dead bodies chopped up in the sewer
From the palms of Jeffrey Dahmer, baby mamas said the kicks
Beat like the brown lip balm that was made for Rihanna
All you fuckin' bloggin' faggots yappin' up that extra shit
I'll shove Bastard down your throat, regurgitate my excrement
Them 2DopeBoyz is fairies they're Peter like boysenberries
Meka scary, turn his white ass to a Jim Carrey twin
A fuckin' sausage fest will them shaky niggas get married then
2DopeBoyz don't want beef, they're just overweight vegetarians[Produced by !llmind]

Yea Ya'll know what it is
Rap City presents Em360
Slaughterhouse, Eminem, Big Tigg, Just Blaze!
On the 1s and 2s, oh-oh

Yo Tigg, get in the not booth
And spit the truth, to the young youth

Aight, ay, Amex don't leave home without your cards
But this Hip Hop, so don't leave home without your bars
And for some of these rap stars, that's just too bad
Cause you can't bring out them bars, that you ain't never had
It's Eminem and Slaughterhouse, yeah you know we the truth
And ohh the game is out of order, since we closed the booth
Yes indeed original, beats the replacement cause
The back room will never be what the basement was

I'm the realest mo'fucker that I know
Wasn't always the case guess the figure had to grow
I do it for the love I don't do it for the dough
But I know these sucker figures will so they keep me on my toes
What's sad is I couldn't tell you what I'm hated for
And them painkillers didn't murder the pain they gave me more
These fans on my head now they say they want the old Joe
I grew up mature y'all can't see that this the old Joe
Want to see me lose every battle of depression
No matter what it do to me, no matter my regression
They want to see me fall, want to ruin my regiment from the start
Want to cut the beat off soon as I let em in my heart
I'd be the first to admit it, lost focus for a while
Sendin' unsolicited dick pics to dimwitted thick chicks
Was so high I lost track of my ways
Then I fell in love with a baby and got mad at her age
The way she act and behave, was it an act or a phase
How you trife when I gave you life
You was lacking in wage
You don't want say hi or speak to me
Bet you makin 200 dollars by weekly
Try to help the world out, bring some reparation
And forget being humble in a state of desperation
Ain't gotta ask what to help with no hesitation
And for me to deal with it I might need some meditation
I love you but its best we stay apart, segregation
And to cope with the feeling I might need some medication
Trust me I don't never want to see that side of Joe
It would kill us all slow, one reason I'm the realest mother-mother I know

Its Nickle, riding round in that Maserati four seat
Symbol on the grill looking like Tony Stark's goatee
Best rapper alive and you know me
The most distinguished shooter that's coming up out of the D since Joe D
I take mines at lead point
At the risk of having to shave my garlic clove in a razor inside a fed joint
Hip hop is alive, but the rhymes died
Only fear I have is "world star" being yelled from my blind side
Don't get me wrong it ain't like I ain't never lost a fight
But these days I'm more like a lyrical artiste
I'm outlining everybody in chalk white
The off-beat deceased version of Dr. Narcisse
This ain't blueprint, your idolizing
You tryna jump fast that's foolish of you in my drunk past and handing me my pilot's license
That's plain stupid, your boy's a star
Sitting in that drop top fish bowl and the doors ajar
It's ironic I remember when I couldn't afford a car
And now it's back and forth
The black one or white one I call 'em Macklemore
And Lord Jamar, first we defyin' the odds
We not a group, we more like a circular firing squad
This not a booth, this is our house and we won't stop
We killed the cypher two times already
What you gon' give us an award
But we won't stop for shutting down the internet
Now tell ya momma hi, and tell Rihanna we ain't finished yet

When we step in that booth, that's when the flame enters
Best spit, make any set trip, yeah its the gang members
Waving that shady flag, navy jag
Matching the yank' fit, with the polo brief showing, due to the lazy sag
I'm in a crazy kind of place
I got this thing right on my waist that'll leave tears on your baby mommas face
So chill, I'm in a crazy kind of place, I got this thing below my waist
That'll leave kids on your baby mommas face, for real
The flow gets cracked, as it came in capsules
Your cap just started snapping
My starter caps was snapping
When cross color was cracking
And my cane was half full
With the half moon park, hope you rap dudes smart
Don't piss me off like the bathroom mop
You don't want it with me
If I'm throwing hooks at you, that don't mean the chorus for free
So save your jabs its way better
If I start throwing jabs I'm talking Zabs first three round against Mayweather
Yeah I'm a crook from the brook, that mastered how (?) shook turned notebook
Broke cook, I'm so dope look
Bring the beat back with no hook just bars
Just a thing of ours that make their pants drop, make em open up their bras
Move g-strings like guitars, that's nothing, that's something light
Like Riesling at the bar
Y-A-O-W-A, if y'all ain't saying Yaowa by now you got nothing to say
This like NWO vs NWA, y'all like the rockers versus the ROC
Full of nothing but Jays
Check the rocks its nothing fugaz'
But don't get stupid my Cooper clique will throw shots for a couple of days
Make it horny when we out, Amityville horror, y'all don't want it with the house

Slaughter season, y'all the reason
Real dudes I'm bringing some more in
Like a Polynesian
Sick with the llama squeezing
Bullets flew and the chopper sneezing
Got your body and legs torn, but before you was airborne
You was bob and weaving still getting hit till your nos' is weezing
They set you deep in your coffin sleeping
I'm gone off the deep end, I'm a wolf, this industry my sheep skin
I'm out here hunting with my ink pen
I'm living like a kingpin
Doing it for my g's in the pen
Dreaming about two-piecing a police chief's chin
You rappers something candy coated, I don't like suckers
I'm Iron Mike, I don't like Busters
You looking for em' fly dudes like Orville and Wilbur
You got the Wright brothers
No bright jeans, no bright colors
I'm the second coming, the one that Pac predicted
Islamic, Gnostic and Christian, the flow so godly you got to listen
I backed you in a dodge a minute
Like MC Eiht in a L.A. hat, these rappers straight tryna dodge a menace
I'm looking at your videos, look like your watching tennis
Brothers dressed like Maria Sharapova wearing yoga pants
Meanwhile Big Poppa was rocking linens
I guess that era's over man, hold on
I'm splitting atoms when the scientific spitting is getting at em'
I give em' different patterns, they didn't fathom, they stealing my styles
Before me you didn't have em'
You rappers made in my image like when God was inventing Adam
Stab em in the abdomen when its crunch time
I truly flip like Mayweather pissed of at a movie script
Too many punchlines
Family I'm amongst mine
I keep the peace like a monks mind
.357 fade your favorite barber
Leave you in an old bush like an unshaven Barbara
Don't stop what we doing
When you see L.A. your team will be ruined
This game need a new villain, I'm the kind to murder you on vine, ooh kill em'

Ladies and gentlemen
Now introducing the man, the myth, the legend
Mister Marshall Mathers AKA (chicka-chicka) Slim Shady

Ayo can we cut this beat off
I might need to do this acapella, yo
Role model?
I'll roll a model down a hill over broke bottles of coke products
If she don't swallow, and thump her till the bumper, hit the throttle
While I'm tryna hit the pot holes, I'll freaking take Madonna to McDonalds
Any bitch'll end up horizontal gettin' fondle
I don't cuddle, I don't coddle
Only motto that I follows any thing I drive, whether its a  Navajo or a Tahoe
Its got a ho in it
Nah ho, I don't got no freaking bronco
You looking for a buck, get a horse, fuck Tonto
I got a rusty Hondo with a bondo
And a box of condoms you little blond ho
Fuck me? fuck you too, like I'm at Bonnaroo booing Bono
And I ain't from this planet so nanu, nana, nanu
I'm intolerable, too volatile, screw it I don't got too make honor roll
To be on a roll
I don't know much, what I do know I do it pronto though
So knock it off, all these knock off me's,
The last thing the world needs is another me
But if you think this is part 2 to Recovery
Or Love The Way You Lie part twelve
Or something heart felt, you bout to make a discovery
Like you found Christopher Columbus' compass
Ain't dumbing shit down for you dumb fuckers, so suck it
I took your best punchline like a punch in the stomach
That punctured a lung punk and I'm still functioning from it
Chump it was nothing
Now watch while I fuckin' one up it and toot my own horn
Once I think of something to trump it
And I don't need a fucking instrument to sound off
Like the trunk of an elephant. The triumphant
Return of the ether spitting retard, reborn
But chances of you having another re-birth, slim to none
Like a skinny Mother Teresa, give a fuck if its Easter, so kiss my keister
Cus that's the only thing I'll turn the other cheek forAyo, Paul. It's Em, I got your call about the Michael Jackson thing
And I know that he's not "thrilled" about the video
What, does he wanna be startin' somethin'?
Wowa, well I'll show him who's really bad
*Burps*
Paul the way you make me feel with these calls
You should really take a look at the man in the mirror and tell him to beat it because I won't stop till I get enough
Do you remember the time we were watching the Billie Jean video
Well he'll always be that Michael to me and it doesn't matter if he's black or white cause I can't stop loving him and I hate plastic surgeons and I hope they all fucking die
How do you like that?
And I like him, I like him a lot
I wanna touch him... but I can't
*Mouth noises*
Excuse me, I'm taking a shit
Sorry, anyways call me back
I have this idea on how I want to end the show
So, hit me when you get this message, fucker
Oh, and by the way, no I don't have a new gun
Goddamn itAll she wrote[Verse 1]
It's the mothafuckin' Farm Club
This little girl 'bout to get a arm rub
Who wanna see me on this mothafuckin' fiction board
Who wanna see me on a mothafuckin' diction lore
And I'll be kicking source to mothafuckin' camera looking right in it
I can kick twenty dope rhymes in one minute
And y'all don't understand cause my rhymes are Infinite

What's the Farm Club?
It's the mothafuckin' *chika-chika* Farm Club
It's the mothafuckin' *chika-chika* Farm Club

Is this shit there wasn't be bleeped out?

Cause we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front
We'll come through the side
Cause I don't ever wanna leave the game without
At least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Scream one last time

Get your ass up for the doctor, one more time
Get your ass up for the doctor, come on now
Here we go, cliff hanger, it's another club banger
Got you hanging on the edge of your seat, get on down

Times up, game's over, you lose, I win
Bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here
Ooh yeah, new year, next phase, begin
Look who's got you going crazy again
I'm a trend, I set one every time I'm in
I go out and just come back full circle again
You a fad, that means your something that we already had
But once you're gone, you don't come back, too bad

You're off the map now, radar can't even find you
We stay on the grind, you slip, we out-grind you
You walk around mad, you let your anger blind you
We walk around just playing the violin behind you
Enough with all the pissing and moaning, whining and bitching
Sit and observe, listen, you'll learn if you pay attention
Why ten multi-platinum albums later, three diamond
Worldwide, we're on the charts with a bullet and still climbing


When Dr. Dre say crunk, you will get it crunk
(Get it crunk, crunk, crunk, crunk)
And when 50 Cent says jump, you get on one foot and jump
(Jump, jump, jump, jump)

The buzz is tremendous, we drop you all to sense it
I don't gotta promote it for you to know that Doc is off the benches
(We keep the party rocking off the hinges
We ain't showing off, we just going off popular consensus)
But critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talk
Doc is all washed up, knock it off, who the fuck is Doc impressing?
Doc is this, Doc is that, you got the wrong impression
You must be on the cock of Doc, cause Doc left you all guessing
So DJ take the needle and just drop it on the record (What?)
We gon' have this mutherfucker hopping in a second (Bump bump)
That's why we always save the best cut last
To make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass

Cause we done swam with the sharks, wrestled with alligators
Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers
Whom if it wasn't for rap to bridge the gap, maybe raised to be racist
Who may have never got to see our faces
Grace the cover of Rolling Stone pages, broke down barriers
Of language and races, just call on the caped crusaders
And leave it to me and Dre to pass the mic and we can play the, back
And forth all day like the hot potato game, that's why we came to


50 Cent, come on!

Bounce now, hands up, you know how we do
We make the club jump everywhere we go
It's no secret, everybody know
When Dre's involved, there's plenty money involved

And plenty honey's involved, the sunny Sundays
And palm trees Cali, every day it's just another party
From the valleys, all the way to them 8 Mile alleys
(Let's rally, hands up for the grand finale
Now raise up out your seat, Dre is about to speak
Blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week)
You could catch me in the studio banging out the beats to
Provide you with the heat that keep blazing out your speaker

So never say never cause Shady/Aftermath together
Along with G-Unit Records presents the return of the.. the Doc (and Shady)
No one could do it better, we tear the club up
And leave without a shred of evidence and uh


Yeah, still Aftermath, 2006
And don't worry 'bout that Detox album
It's coming, we gon' make Dre do it
HAHA!
50 Cent, G-Unit, Obie Trice, D-Twizzy, Stat Quo, Dr. Dre
We ain't leaving, let's go!
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you all for coming out, peace!

Oh shit, I almost forgot, you're coming with me..
Bye bye! (See you in hell, fuckers)Regular Cover:

Collectors Edition Cover:Brent Musberger: We welcome you back to Ann Arbor, Michigan and what a pleasure for Herbie and me to introduce Marshall Mathers. Some of you may know him as Eminem, but he's gonna join the Saturday night crew with our music intro starting next Saturday Night.

But folks, I wanna take you to the World Premiere of one of his new videos, called Berzerk. Take a listen, it's headed to the top of the charts.


BM: Was that Rick Rubin who was helping produce that, with you Marshall, when you did that?

Eminem: Yeah, sorry. Live TV. Live TV freaks me out a little bit.

Kirk Herbstreit (KH): No!?

Eminem: Umm...yes. I'm sorry, what was the question?

BM: That was Mr. Rubin, one of the all-time greats...producer, huh?

Eminem: Yes, yes.

BM: How long does that take you to shoot a video like that? How many takes? How many hours?

Eminem: Umm...sometimes it's uh...it's usually a two day process, sometimes it could go to three. There's a lot of takes, there's a lot of sticking around waiting...But...it's cool [Herbstreit tries to interject] if the video comes out, then i guess it's worth it. You know.

KH: You wanna take it to break?

BM: Yeah...we'll take....you know...you gotta be in shape too, but stay right here with us, we're gonna kick off the 2nd half and I wanna talk about how you're gonna intro Saturday Night Football when we come back.


BM: 8 EST on ABC, Marshall Mathers will open Saturday Night Football. Mathers, it's a pleasure to have you on the show.

Eminem: Absolutely, pleasure to be here. It's an honor to be able to do that. So..

KH: So you have the single out...album's coming out in November. What are you most excited about with this no album?

Eminem: Nothing.

KH: No?

Eminem: No...uhh...it'll be out Nov 5th. I'll probably be most excited to just be done with it. It's called the Marshall Mathers LP2. And..it's kind of a re-visit to the first Marshall Mathers LP...and umm...that's pretty much all i can say about it.

BM: One final question before you leave. Some of my friends in Montana wanted me to ask you. Will the Lions cover 4.5 tomorrow against Minnesota?

Eminem: Will the Lions cover 4.5?

BM: Yeah.

Eminem: Ummm...I'm not sure man...I don't ever make a prediction on the Lions cause I don't ever wanna jinx it, but I'm such a die hard Lions fan, like...to the core. So...yes, they'll win.

KH: That's all you'll say, leave it at that.

Eminem: Yeah...I'm hoping I didn't just jinx it.

BM: Here's the kickoff Marshall...just stick right here with us now. It's gonna be Wolverines ball. They've got the lead...out to the 25 yard line.

Marshall, again, it was a pleasure having you with us here tonight.

Eminem: And Brent, just how they got fantasy football or whatever. I got you on my fantasy announcer team. It would be you, of course the late great Pat Summerall and John Madden and Al Michaels. If you guys would get together and just call the game....Kirk, you're great too, much respect.


KH: Not quite to that status yet, I get it!

Eminem: Right. But, you being a legend and you know, if you got with Al Michaels man and John Madden and just called ONE Lions game. The Super Bowl probably would be great this year.

KH: We'd all appreciate that wouldn't we?

Eminem: Man, that would be like a dream come true for me. You are a legend my friend. Thank you.

BM: YOU're the legend my friend! 13 Grammys, 1st rap song to win an Academy Award, an original score...Youve sold 100 million records world wide. YOU my friend are the legend.

KH: No doubt about that!

Eminem: I'm really uncomfortable right now.


BM: Marshall, take care my friend. We look forward to seeing that video next week.

Eminem: Absolutely, Thank you, thank you...[verse 1: Eminem]
Lights, action, cameras flashing
Managers, sponsors, concerts, monster mashing
Flashing type of mic
That was unaware of trash like Marilyn Manson
Updated Axle Rose
White version of shaft pimp slappin' hoes
Pull up like a Mac, jet black limo
Strecth so far back you can't see the back windows
Stepping out pink hats, furs and minks
Chicks on each arm, what the fuck you think?
Right arm go that kid from N'Sync's chick on it
Left arm got that little pink chick on it
Me and Dre at the VMA's again
Pissin' off all these lesbians and gays again

Let me show you what the clip does
Cause D12 are harder than virgins inside strip clubs
Yo, we bust thugs
You beatin us is like 20 inch doves on glove buzz
It won't happen don't take the satisfaction
With funk flex you got your back spittin'
Actin' like you harder than life
Peace to Obie Trice
Rock a mic is on the right
Obie Trice has been around the globe twice
How it feel with the shine show was
Peace to Mark Labelle, Flex and Paul Rosenburg
Yo M. Diddy save me ayo, I think my dad's going crazy[Intro]
Lord, please forgive me for what I do
For I know not what I've done

Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

Momma had a baby and it's head popped off (head popped off
Head popped off, head popped off, head popped off, head popped off)
My momma don't want me the next thing I know I'm gettin' dropped off
(gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off)
Ring ring ring on the door bell and the next door neighbors on their front porch
(their front porch, their front porch, their front porch, their front porch)
But they didn't want me neither so they left me on someone else's lawn
(else's lawn, else's lawn, else's lawn) 'til somebody finally took me in
My Great Aunt and Uncle, Edna 'n Charles (Edna 'n Charles
Edna 'n Charles, Edna 'n Charles, Edna 'n Charles)
They were the ones who were left in charge
My elementary they ganged up on me and sang this song
(sang this song, sang this song, sang this song, sang this song)
It went a little something like
Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb
Debbie had a Satan spawn, Satan spawn
Momma why do they keep saying this I just don't understand, understand
And by the way, where's my daaaaaaaaaaad?

Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

Predominantly, predominantly, everything's always predominantly
Predominantly white, predominantly black, but what about me
Where does that leave me? Well I guess that I'm between predominantly
Both of 'em, I think if I hear that fuckin' word again I'mma scream
While I'm projectile vomiting, what do I look like, a comedian to you?
Do you think that I'm kidding? What do I look like some kind of idi-
Wait a minute, shit, don't answer that - why am I so misunderstood?
Why do I go through so much bullshit, it's such bullshit, it's tush mull bisch
Woe is me, there goes poor Marshall again whinin about his millions
And his mansion and his sorrow he's always drownin' in
From the dad he never had, and how his childhood was so bad
And how his mom was a dope addict, and his ex-wife how they go at it
Man I'd hate to have it, as bad as that Mr. Mathers, claims he had it
I can't imagine it, that little rich poor white bastard
Needs to take some of that cash out the bank and take a bath in it
Man if I only had half of it
Shit, if you only knew the half of it

Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

Evil deeds, while I plant these evil seeds
Please release me from these demons
I never had any of this shit planned, mom, please believe
I don't wanna be Satan's spawn, never got the chance to say I'm sorry
Now look at all the pain I caused
Dear Santa Claus, why you not comin' this year again?
What did I do that was so bad to deserve this?
Everything could have been so perfect
But life ain't a fairytale, I'm about to be hoisted up in the air
Forty feet below me, there's people everywhere
I don't even know why they feel like they know me cause I'm in this ferris wheel
And all I wanna do is go to the mall and take Hailie on the carousel
Without this crowd everywhere I go, but life is like a merry-go-round
Here we go now, doe-se-doe now, curtains up, the show must go
Now ring around the rosie, the show's over, you can all go home now
But the curtain just don't close for me, this ain't how fame is supposed to be
Where's the switch I could just turn off and on, this ain't what I chose to be
So please God, give me the strength to have what it takes to carry on
'til I pass 50 back the baton, the camera's on, my soul is gone

Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

*gunshot* Oh!
*crowd cheering* Last one baby, let's go
*shells hit floor, clips inserted* Detroit![Intro]
Yeah, trying to figure out the difference
But I think the lines are starting to get blurred

I'm in a strange place
I feel like Ma$e when he gave up the game for his faith
I feel like I'm caged in these chains and restraints
Grimming every stranger in the place while I gaze into space
Cause I'm mentally rearranging his face
I need a change of pace cause the pace I'm working at is dangerous
There's nowhere to dump this anger and thanks to this angst
I done quit chicken heads cold turkey and started slowly roasting 'em
Cause that's where most of my anger is baste
Fuck your feelings, I feel like I play for the Saints
I just want to hurt you - aim for the skanks
Then aim for all these fake Kanyes, Jays, Waynes and the Drakes
I'm frustrated cause ain't no more N'Sync, now I'm all out of whack
I'm all out of Backstreet Boys to call out and attack
I'm going all out in this rap shit and whatever the fallout is I'm strapped
For battles sucka - duck, crawl out the back
It's a bar fight, prepare your arsenal and beware of bar stools
Flying through the air and bottles breaking, mirrors also
And I ain't stopping 'til the swear jar's full
"You done called every woman a slut
But you're forgetting Sarah, Marshall (Palin)"
Oh, my bad. Slut
And next time I show to in court I'll be naked and just wear a lawsuit
Judge be like "That's sharp, how much did that motherfucker cost you?
Smart-ass, you're lucky I don't tear it off you
And jump your bones, you sexy motherfucker
You're so fucking gravy, Marshall I should start calling you 'au jus'
Cause all you do is spit them lyrics out the wazoo"
Evil twin, take this beat now, it's all you
I believe people can change, but only for the worse
I could've changed the world if it wasn't for this verse
So satanic, K-Mart chains panic
Cause they can't even spin back the curse words
Cause they're worse when they're reversed motherfucker
(Rape your mother, kill your parents) [shit, motherfucker]
And these kids are like parrots, they run around the house just like terrorists
Screaming, "fuck, shit, fuck" adult with a childish-like arrogance
Wild ever since the day I came out I was like, merits
Fuck that - I'd rather be loud and I like swearing
From the first album even the gals were like "tight lyrics
Dreamy eyes", but my fucking mouth was nightmare-ish
And from the start of it you felt like you were part of this and
Opposition felt the opposite, sometimes I listen
And revisit them old albums often as I can and skim through all them bitches
To make sure I keep up with my competition (ha ha)
Hogger of beats, hoarder of rhymes
Borderline genius who's bored of his lines
And that sort of defines where I'm at and the way I feel now
Feel like I might just strike first and ignore the replies

There's darkness closing in, there it goes again
It controls my pen, but that ain't me, it's my evil twin
(Then I step out and see my evil twin, he gives me an evil grin)
But he's just a friend, who pops up now and again
So don't blame me, just blame him, it's my evil twin
(I step out and see my evil twin, he gives me an evil grin)

Welcome back to the land of the living, my friend
You have slept for quite some time

So who's left, Lady Gaga? Mess with the Bieber
Nah, F with Christina, I ain't fucking with either Jessica neither
Simpson or Alba, my albums just sicker than strep with the fever
Get the Cloriseptic, Excedrin, Aleve or
Extra Strength Tylenol 3's, feel like I'm burning to death but I'm freezing
Bed ridden and destined never to leave the
Bedroom ever again like the legend of Heath-uh-
Ledger, my suicide notes, barely legible read the
Bottom, it's signed by the Joker, Lorena said I never can leave her
She'd sever my wiener I ever deceive her
Fuck that shit bitch, Give up my dick for pussy?
I'd be Jerry Mathers, I ever left it to Beaver
Get them titties cut off trying to mess with a cleaver
Golly-wally, I vent, heat register, Jesus
Ever since 1-9-9-4-6 Dresden, it was definitely my
Destiny when on the steps, I met DeShaun
At Osborn, I'd never make it to sophomore
I just wanted to skip school and rap, used to mop floors
Flip burgers and wash dishes, but I wrote rhymes trying to get props for 'em
Cause I took book-smarts and swapped for 'em
They were sleeping, I made 'em stop snorin'
Made them break out the popcorn
Now I've been hip-hop in it's tip-top form
Since N.W.A was blaring through my car windows leaning on the horn
Screaming "Fuck the police" like cop porn
Flipped rap on its ear like I dropped corn
Fuck top five, bitch, I'm top four
And that includes Biggie and Pac, whore
And I got an Evil Twin
So who the fuck do you think that third and that fourth spot's for?
And crazy as I am I'm much tamer than him
And I'm nuts, then again who the fuck wants a plain Eminem?
But no one's insaner than Slim, look at that (evil grin)
(Evil twin) please come in, what was your name again?
Hi! Faggot
Look who's back with a crab up his ass
Like a lobster crawled up there
Two rabbits, a koala bear and a ball of hair
And you're all aware I don't got it all upstairs
Guess that's why I'm an addict and it's so small up there
Peace to Whitney, jeez just hit me
That I should call the Looney Police to come get me
Cause I'm so sick of being the truth, I wish someone finally admit me
To a mental hospital with Britney
Oh LMFAO, no way, Jo-
Se Baez couldn't beat this rap, OJ no
Hooray, I'm off the hook like Casey Anthony, (hey ho) Hey-ho!
I sound like I'm trying to sing the fucking chorus to "Hip Hop Hooray", no
I’m hollering you got bottom-end like an 8-0-
8 and I 'base' whether we're fucking off that instead of your face, so
Let your low end raise, yo
Tango, what you think, ho? Slow dancing or bowling?
You trying to hold hands with your homie?
What, you think I'm looking for romance cause I'm lonely?
Change that tune, you ain't got a remote chance to control me
Ho, I'm only vulnerable when I got a bo-ner
Superman try to fuck me over, it won't hurt
Don't try to fix me, I'm broke so I don't work
So are you, but you're broke cause you don't work
But all bullshit aside, I hit a stride
Still Shady inside, hair every bit as dyed

Cause Baby I'm Lonely
Can Somebody Hold Me
It Feel Like I'm Fallin Now, I Can't Hold My Ground
It Feels Like I'm Only
Trying But Slowly
It Feels Like I'm Fallin Now, I Can't Hold My Ground
No More

Probably one of my realest loves ever, four page letters
In time it’s all better, ‘cause time heal whatever
I'mma need a moment cause moments last forever
Cars with cream leather, females are on regular
What’s the point in titles, we liking it how they tell us
I’d rather stay friends with benefits 'til we ready
Now ready, Sean Don got me feeling heavy
She like one more chance, more problems, no Biggie, ah
It’s all good, don’t take it the wrong way
Ain’t nothing personal, but who this nigga in your face?
We can leave together or you can take your space
The night young, we should head over to my place
Ha, now we laughing and all that
Tell your friend they can fall back
Ain’t even gotta ask twice
She said what you feeling like?
I'm like...


Jimmy can crack corn but I don't care
My enemies crack corn but I don't care

You can be black white or albino yeah
You can have cornrows inside your hair
I give a fuck if I don't like your stare
This bottle of wine goes upside your head

A little bit psycho but I know that
Think you just don't say it and I won't say it
See if you don't brag then I don't brag
I know I'm bad as long as I know I'm bad
I don't need ya'll to co-sign no shit
You can just keept making them tired old threats
Little bit like the boy who cried wolf did
See me but don't dare to try no shit
Cuz you know that somewhere inside those layers
The rattlesnakes right there to bite your ass
And I can be so quite and strike so fast
Like lightening bolts right out the sky go blast


Cause Baby I'm Lonely
Can Somebody Hold Me
It Feel Like I'm Fallin Now, I Can't Hold My Ground
It Feels Like I'm Only(*dialing tone*)

(Good evening, may I help you?)
Yeah, how you doin', um
I need to get the number for, um
Fat Beats, Los Angeles? California?
(Oh, one moment please, hold on)
Alright, how you doin'
(Ok, one moment) How you doin'?
(Ok sir ,one moment, um
SAT is giving me) Right, it's real easy (I have-
I have nothing for the name, sir, I'm sorry)
Maybe it's, um, PH80
(*dialing tone*)
I know they got it, I know they have it
(Fat Beats) Brian, they got- Hello?
(Hello?) Hi, it's time (Who?)
I-I know- It's time, I know you guys have it
Is it- Do you guys have it? It-it's there
(What?) Ste- Eh-eh-um...
Last time, it-it came out, um, uh

I GOT FAT BEATS ON THE PHONE! HURRY UP!
(*laughing*) Oh, hello
Hi, hehe (Ok, who are you talking about?
I don't know who're you talking about)
EMINEM, YOU FUCKING BITCH![Intro]
To the Batmobile, let's go

Yo', Manix man, I'mma take this one kinda slow, alright?

Welcome to the flipside
Hope he can swim, cause if he can't, he gonna drown on a rip tide
It's pourin', plus the old man ain't snoring
Cause he gotta get up pretty damn early in the morning
Cause I'm slammin' like Basketball Jones
Swoopin' out thrones and leaving nothing but the break bones
You suckers disgust me like low fat
Gimme' a bat and I'll show you where your head at
Tryna' hit the row with the paddles you little bocce?
I think you better stay home and eat your broccoli
Cause you still got a long ways to go
So you better step northeast cause you picked the wrong chump
You ain't ready to throw with the mighty man
And don't forget about the rest of the band
So you better get used to the shrine
Cause I've been rappin' as long as I can write rhymes
These grandma hands make stuff like pottery
To making too too many shots, you'd think it start an astrology
You wanted to live so tell about what you went through
You couldn't cut the mustard if I gave you a Ginsu


Quickly, step to the side cause I'm coming through
You think you was looking to call me W or double-you?
So how could you think you outdid me
While I'm getting getaways quicker than a kidney
That was to a rabbit as sticky then you're a total pigeon
You know you couldn't even blow a rhyme in a circle
You little kiddies are getting a bit too frolicky
Throwing me lot more sorries than an apology
Pass me the chalk and the vite Court Plea
Let me give it the proper operation that it needs
So allow me to put a end to weak melody
Need it for suckers like peanut butter and cellery
Switch up the zone and put words that I kick with ease
And you with the face, not feel a pygmy
And let her resent like Tia's mama
More tooth than a sharp pair of shears
And given that, I couldn't throw up a chop suey
You remember the day you watched Wicca Pool
Then you'll know what it's like to take a nosedive
Beat by the fattest skinny kid alive!

'Aight, we're gonna break it down for a second, and I'mma catch my breath
And I'mma let Buttafingaz go off on a scratch for a minute
Dude, Buttafingaz, when I give it to you; come up with that funkyassdiculous-dope scratch
Go for it

Yeah, let me show you how the big boys play
Thinking 'bout us bust out [into the fat?] girl on a Wednesday
While I grab the steel and put you through an ordeal
Some kneel before me or feel who's more real
I'mma do best, mom, look out for the plaque!
Start flowin' so much, I'll be in need of a maxipad
It went so fast, my pen undelaney
Do so many torques, my song will be a felony
Well shit, that's what you get for being clumsy
Get more, steppin' up, finger the competition
I got more jerks in my basement than you do in twitches
Hope you all get played out like Batman
Work like pay dirt and bust by the Fatman
And I take over like a doctor
Boy, I'm on 'em so fast, I swear they make me report this
Who gets whip cream and rough as a calis
That's to all my lizards, they call me Mr. Mathers
With a soul intent for destruction
One more hit for the Downstairs Productions

The fattest skinny kid alive! x4[People chanting Eminem]





I almost forgot
You're comin' with me


That's him baby, let's go
That's him baby, let's go
That's him baby, let's go

Another day, another hotel, the inside of it is nice though, oh well
This is my life so as I go and try on clothes for tonight's show
To see how far that line goes, still blows my mind, show business
Guess I'll just never get, so this shit just always feels so weird
To this day because all's I ever did
Was just say the shit I would've wanted to hear
Other people say to me when I was a kid
So please don't make me some type of hero
Cause I will say some ol' inspirational shit in a real way
But still will have a field day with some of the fucked up shit
In the world and tell it to suck on the dick, cause I still make fun
Of a sitch someone's in like a son of a bitch at another's expense
I'm fuckin' relentless as fuck when it comes to this pen
I struggle with coming to senses, stuck on the fence
It's a balance beam, if I seem unbalanced, it's challenging
When my conscience allows me to think the most foulish
Childish things without even blinking, without even thinkin' about
All the stinkin' amounts of people that seems to be reachin'
But the crowds, they're screaming
And The Palace sold out this evening
But now it's lay me down to sleeping
Is it really my soul to keep, or have I sold it cheap?
Is it greed? And do I take more than I need?
When I joke of leavin', but keep overachievin'
Cause what it's stole from me I've barely broken even

I know, it's a fine, fine line
Living in hope or dire need
I know, it's a fine, fine line
Living in hope or dire need

So a martyr is how I paint myself
And through my heroin ordeals I’m so vein I want my respect
But ignore the butterfly effect that comes from my dialect
'Til I sit in the dark and I reflect
And my reflection shows what it's like here
Cause this vanity, surrounded by all these lights
Yeah, it's like a nightmare
I said, this vanity surrounded by these lights is a night mirror
And I don't like how I see myself, so I open the Bible to Isaiah
Cause I swear to Christ there are nights when I stay up and might
Say a prayer twice just to make sure God hears
Cause this ice layer I skate on's a nice way of putting it
But I like stayin' feistier than a triceratops and like a dice player
I got a nice paradise here, sealed off in my lair
Away from the bullshit good safe place to sit and talk shit from
And this house, is quite bare, but it ain't when you can't leave it
And I feel so isolated, it's nice I made it
But it's like I paid the price of fame twice, I hate it
So I bitch about my life then make another song
Vicious cycle ain't it, then wonder why I stay famous
I keep walkin' the line, this goldfish bowl gets old
But especially if you don't know
If your conscience is sayin' I told you so
Cause you don't even know anymore
If you got the soul of a soldier, or you sold your soul


And from here you look so small
Hovering high above us all
Please come back to me

I still remember the times when
They were simpler than the rhymes of
Vanilla Ice were when I was just killin' the mics
I'll never forget what that feeling was like
I miss those times now when I was just starting out
Without a dime and, now I'm diamond
I can't even stage dive in the crowd anymore now when I've been
Stuck in this house hibernatin'
Hate even going outside
It sucks, sometimes I just wanna walk into Target and look at shit and browse, I don't even want to buy nothin'
I just wanna fuckin' walk around inside it
Look how excited I sound when I get to talkin' bout life and
Everything about it I miss, which now reminds me
Put a thousand lighters in the sky for the Outsidaz
Wow, I must have had Alzheimer's
Long time since I shouted them out, 'bout time
Cause it's been on my mind lately how
Zee, you always supported me
You vouched, I will never forget that and
How you guys accepted me for me and Pace
I love you too, you slept on my couch
And I've been thinkin' 'bout the time when I slept on the floor at The Outhouse
Rhyming's all we ever wanted to do
And regardless how life has turned out
Inside I'll, I'll always be an outsider
My life has been turned inside out but I


But I keep walkin' the line...[Paul Rosenberg]
First Word, Excrement

Exclimate, is that what you said?
My next defense, against these extra men
Who try to step to me and wanna have sex again


You little sickass, I'll spray em with gasoline
They try to jack me off with Vaseline
My ass is mean, I smash your spleen
When I crash the scene


With a cell phone, now who the hell is home?
Y'all can't tell Paul how to throw me words


Cause animal crackers is what I do when I eat MC's like a cannibal backwards
Ha ha, I got it, that's not it
Fake rappers been spotted


Like broken headphones, you head home, you sped home
You get your head blown, rappers try to step, they speak in the dead tones
So I ain't trying to hear them, give me another, word for your mother


Stretch Armstrong, my brother, coming with rhymes every time that I be drumming
Running with this shit when I kick a bitch in the stomach
And star wars, this car's a Taurus
Yo, how many bars we hit tonight, cause I'm drunk off


Off peanut butter, you see my dick and you start to stutter
Start to utter, words that you shouldn't utter


Cause Mark Whalberg is a small turd, and I'mma step on him like dogshit
A fore fist, so rappers just get off it, I come across with


With pulp fiction, yo I'll eat you like a big gulp addiction
Like slurpees, got herpes, got a hair piece, rest my anises(?)
Got brain damage, I'm dumber than rain man is
There's mayonnaise on this, I need a plain sandwich
Hurry up, give me one, rappers try to step to this static they wanna give me none


With fresh vegetables, my testicles are hanging off to the left of you
You're bisexual, and there's a guy next to you, standing, rappers know that I
Be-


Preparation H, you didn't even let me finish my rhyme
Just shut up for one more time, while I just shine, on this
Microphone, cause I'mma be honest, any MC who tries to step to this
I'm making you a promise, that what? Give me a word


That Nostradamus is blowing up your house, killing your foster mammas
And coming back to get your parents, well I have it
These rhymes are fourteen karat, solid gold
Rappers step to me, you get your wallet stole


In Times Square, I got blonde hair, I'm higher than con air
Rappers don't want to see me, I'll butt fuck Goldie Hawn bare
In a lawn chair, cause I'm there


With Kurt Russell, saying "come here Goldie, you want my love muscle?"
I know you want it, I get blunted, then I
Kick these, freestyles just like whipped knees


With a taxicab, I'll smack a bitch with a maxi pad
Where we going? Don't ask me dad
Leave me alone, I'm not trying, to even hear you
Dad, I hope you're fucking dying, off this porno mag
Yo, did you see my ad? Yo, wait a minute, did you see my ass?
Is what I meant to say, I meant to say a rhyme that goes this way is elementary
For the century, Slim Shady's is gonna be the illest


What? Flamingos? My mother goes out and plays bingo
Every single day, at the bingo hall, that's why my dick is single, small
Didn't blow up, just don't give a what? A cuff?
Didn't blow up, just don't give a what? A cuff?


But DT's fired, he's retired, he's not hired, yo plus I'm tired
Of busting and spitting this rhyme nonstop, I'm on top
Taking records to the pawnshop, stretch
Damn, see my big ick? Catch
Put a D in front of it, rappers don't want none of it
Coming with a ton of shit to spill, Slim Shady out, I get ill with the skill
Baby, aight baby, Slim Shady
Kick eighty million rhymes, till I'm older than Grady
Spilled gravy, all over my damn navy blue avi
Bye bye[Hook: Just Blaze]
Some people ask me, where I've been lately
They thought I fell off, nobody can save me
They play in the background, I don't back down
So don't get it twisted or try to play me
First I come out, they underrate me
Then I come back, they still try to fade me
They say I'm nasty, they say I'm crazy
Ask what I think and I say maybe I'll fly away
There ain't nothing in my way so I may as well fly away
There ain't nothing else to say so I may as well fly away
I know you wanna see me down but we ain't gonna die today
Cause I done been to the top and there's nowhere else to go
The only way you see me is if you looking up from down below
And there's nothing else to say so I may as well fly away
I'm on top of this game so I may as well fly away

Got my self esteem back, got my confidence up
I'm gonna step up on this stage now, I'm gonna strut
And walk around with my pants hanging offa my butt
And you ain't bout to tell me nothing boy get off of my nuts
It goes one for the money, two for the show
My shit don't stink, I don't think so
Wipe my ass with the tissue and roll it back up in the roll
Are you ready now, here we go, the bald eagle has landed
I'm back in your hair, sorry for leaving you stranded
I'm twice as dreaded, evil and rancid
They can't sit, I don't think anybody understands it
Especially when the world's silly putty in your hands
It's Play-Doh, I ain't back to play, though
They say he died in a fatal car crash, shows what they know
Shit if I did, it'd be a trailer not a car
The white trash star, I fuck an RV-up like Brett Favre
Homie you got it backwards, you're dipping your soup
Inside your crackers, I can carry rap til my back hurts
Set it down, go right back to the chiropractor
Get my back right then I'm right back on you bastards
I was chasing the dragon, I don't know what happened
It's like the feeling I had when I first started rappin'
I just couldn't seem to get back and recapture that magic
So I went back to the lab, that's where I been at when


I took a hiatus, haters now I'm back to cause trouble
Got the fucking shape of mushroom clouds for thought bubbles
I'm the... you ain't fucking sick, the hospital
Won't even give you cough drops for coughs cocksucker
You think you hot you ain't even lukewarm
My puke's hotter than you, you're soft
I use fire to cool me off
I told them I would grow up one day and show them
I'd be able to choke clouds
Pick up lightning bolts and throw them
Take the world by storm with these words I form
Georgi-porgi kissed the girls, make the girls cry for it
Make them swarm, make them fight over the shirts I've worn
Swoon over my sweat towels it's mind blowing
Yes I'm living the dream homie, can't nothing compare
I’m so up, I’m stuck in mid air, I’m loving it yeah
It's like these people are steps now, all they do is stare
These haters are so pussy they're afraid to be scared
This is pay back, like I owe them back pay
They spat in my face now I'm back to do them the same exact way
And leave this rap game with a bad taste
And slap it back out before I step back outta this crap, they
Slap me now I'm slapping them back hey, fuck it
We're slap happy, yeah okay, now I'm talking some smack, aye
And I ain't looking back, in fact, they can stare at my ass crack
How's that for hind site, what the track say


My mom sent me up to the store with a food stamp
For a pack of cigarettes and a book at the news stand (Here)
Two dudes ran up, jumped out of a blue van
I looked down at the ground and picked up a huge branch
I swung it at the first dude, the other one with him
Seen it snap so fast it looked like it broke before it hit him
So he tried to rush, I swept his legs pinned him and bit him
He came back with 6 or 7 dudes screaming "GET HIM!"
I grabbed one lit him on fire pinned and bit him
The next faggot gave me his shoes like they didn't fit him
One by one I just kept droppin' 'em in a rythm
Then I woke up swingin' in the middle of the kitchen

(Damn... damn... damn...)Oh foolish pride, oh, oh, oh, oh foolish pride
Oh, oh, oh, oh foolish pride, oh, oh, oh, oh foolish pride

Well foolish pride has a lot of things to say
You got foolish pride, like you got tooth decay
But tooth decay is another problem
So let's take this old foolish pride problem and solve it
Now, when I talk about foolish pride
I mean blacks and whites taking different sides
When blacks and whites take different sides
Unity never happens, and we will subside
We will subside and hatred will release
And everything will just crush that peace
But when we crush that peace, you see we start hatin' each other
But remember, you are my brother, and you are my sister
Just like I'm a mister
I seen a black girlfriend and I kissed her
I kissed her, I placed it on her cheek
And she didn't come back til next week
Now it was next week and she was back again
Wanting to kiss a white kid
So she was my girlfriend, we started going out
But that's okay because we were black and white
Blacks and whites they sometimes mix
But black girls only want your money cause they're dumb chicks
So I'mma say like this
Don't date a black girl, take it as a diss
If you want, but if you don't
I'mma tell you like this, I surely won't
Never date a black girl because blacks only want your money
And that shit ain't funny
So I'mma say look honey
Why do you do this?
You know, you step up to me like you a Brutus
Then you try to grab my spinach
Because it's green and that's cash
So get outta here, cause I don't need your ass
I said that before, but that's okay because like I said you're a whore
Black girls and white girls just don't mix
Because black girls are dumb and white girls are good chicks
White girls are good, I like white girls
I like white girls all over the world
White girls are fine and they blow my mind
And that's why I'm here now telling you this rhyme
Cause black girls, I really don't like
We don't mix, it's like riding a bike
When you're peddling hard, uphill both ways
You know it's kinda hard and that's why I say to you
I'm giving you a little advice
Don't date a black girl, if you do it once you won't do it twice
You won't ever do it again because they'll take your money
And that ain't funny
So I'mma say look honey
I thought he said that before
But like I said again you're nothing but a big whore
So when mike catch on the bass line
That's okay ‘cause we will not just waste time
I'll get straight to the point
Black girls are bitches, that's why I'mma tell ya you better pull up your britches
‘Cause all that cash is making your ass drag
From the boyfriend you ganked and that's pretty bad
I mean that's pretty sad when you're dating a black guy
And then you turn around and fuck another big black guy
Now that's pretty wrong, but you're just ganking
But that's okay because you need a goddamn spanking
From me, the funky M'n'M
I'm busting rhymes and I'm swallowing phlegm
I'm busting a freestyle just like this
I say swallowing phlegm and Howard gets pissed
But when Howard gets pissed that's okay
Because he leaves and he doesn't show up for two more days
So I'll just worry about that problem when I come to it
I'll cross that bridge when I come to it
Because, I forgot the chorus
But that's okay cause y'all saying bust a rhyme for us
So I'mma bust another rhyme about this black girl
She turned out to be a fuckin' wack girl
A wack girl, because black girls ain't funny
All they want is your goddamn money
They take you for everything you got
And then you stand with a bunch of snot in your hand
So I'mma kick it to you just like this
How does the chorus go, I forgot
But that's okay, cause I'mma tell you in stride
I'mma say oh foolish pride

Oh foolish pride, oh, oh, oh, oh foolish pride
Oh, oh, oh, oh foolish pride, oh, oh, oh, oh foolish pride
Oh, oh, oh, oh foolish pride, oh, oh, oh, oh foolish pride
Oh, oh, oh, oh foolish pride, oh, oh, oh
Date a white girl, cause they got the raw hideLet me tell your first
When I'm done freestylin youll need a fuckin hurst
I'm white yeah I'm kinda like slim shady
And looking at you, ur probably hung like a baby
I pissed you off with that one liner
But I'm sure ill do it again like a big tymer
Ok right now I'm gonna let you flow
And when I'm tired of hearin your shit ill let you know

Its my turn and I'm gonna drop a bomb
Blow you up like a fucking Vietcong
I'm sick with the rhymes I've just said
Don't mind my face its a little red
Cuz I'm embarrassed to be up here its true
Its not cuz I'm scared its cuz I'm battling someone like you
I mean jesus your rhymes ain't even witty
And every one here knows your lyrics are shitty
But its ok cuz your tryin your best
And if you have a girlfriend I'm sure her backs like her chest
In other words you be fucking a guy
And don't tell me the excuse, its cuz I was high
Its cuz your like at the other fags who think their cool
But infact your really enjoy pushing it stool!

I'm done ok I can't think of any thing else to say
I'm at lost for words cuz my rhymes might be soundin gay
But then again we listened to your rhymes so I guess it would be ok
Ill finish your off with a one liner and then I'm done
This is the rhyme that with solididfy that I won
I listened to every rhyme youve said
And it was all mumble jumble like your were giving some head
Now remember I'm white so I don't belong in the rap game
But id be there before you cuz your lyrics where fuck in lame!!![Eminem freestyling]

Die Bitches, Check it out bitches
All you bitch ass rappers
Need to get your clip pierced, Look at me, hip, I'm Britney Spears
Look at the way I wear my mascara
How you doing
I'm Pristina Gaguilera, And I sing songs about a genie in a bottle
And I'm Britney Spears
I got big tits, I'm a role model
To all little kids
But I got breast implants
That was the only way to get my chest enhanced
And here I go with the lyrical, miracle, spiritual everytime im incredible
With freestyles from the top that I drop
And my instinct
Is to kill N'Sync
And the Backstreet Boys
It really doesn't matter coz' I got a scratchy voice
Yo, check it out
But you ask me I ain't gonna be happy til' I see every member of the Backstreet Boys
Getting their ass beat
In the back seat of a taxi, And dropped of on the real backstreet
And somebody black sees five little rich white boys
Looking like faggots
With the N painted on the back of their jackets
Ohhhhh
And god damn it
Can't stop there
What's up?
It's over
And this just Some Bacardi and Mountain Dew
And wonder how we tune is
Ten million{Freestyle over Jay-Z's 'So Ghetto'}

Yeah. Now I'm getting distorted. (Can you turn it down) When I was...I should've been aborted. But it was too late...uh oh. (Uh oh) Yo, just turn up the beat a little bit. I don't care if the mic is distorted. Fuck it

That's it, that's it, gotta hit than pass it
I'm blasted off a tab of acid
Flabbergasted
Hopped in a cab and blasted the cab driver
I said...haha
Hold on a minute
Give me infinite beats that I can kick for a minute
Y'all don't understand
The way that I got this mic in my hand
Killing any MC who stands or sits or walks
Or is handicapped
It doesn't Mr. Handicap, hand me that
Haha
I clap hands with the rap fans
Jump in their wheelchairs and give 'em a lap dance
I'm the illest MC who will kill this
And what?
And Die Hard like who?
(Bruce Willis)
Thank you very much that's a fucking cliche
But I will rock the microphone and don't care about what he say
Or they say or I say or we say or them say
Eminem say shit that only Slim say
Or Slim says
Fuck a les
-bian in her ass
Korean or a...
Haha

Ayo, let me try something. Uh uh uh uh uh uh. I'm not free in here, check it out

I rap if there was no rap within a soul clap
Expose wack rappers and smack 'em with my bozack
Flatten 'em like inner tubes
Punch my fist through the torso of thinner dudes
And when I'm in the mood make a serious winner lose
Get high of gin and booze

Hahahaha
In an inner tube
While I'm in the nude
With a centerfold
In the winter cold

Ayo we give it though
Give me an envelope
I get with Tim Westwood show
And Cypher Sounds I strike you down
Don't like the way you sound, you wack now
You got my style packed down or should I say down pack
Any MC's will tell you right now that you sound wack
Call us up and then we make noise then see shells
We shall prevail you faker than Lee Nails
And we tell D-12 to all those that don't know
Flow for flow we rocking your radio
How you feel right now?
C'mon Shady flow
Yo, yo, yo


{beat switches to LL Cool J's 'Ill Bomb'}


Trapped in a cinema, in a material world
Criminal, cops scour the rural area thorough
Cause I kissed a girl, married a girl
Carried a girl to the cemetery, buried a girl
And I'm desperate, no one to mess with
Always get arrested for something domestic
And I kill the way you met me
You'll never catch me, cops can't sketch me
You can't upset me, no matter how bad
How mad you get me
Problem with y'all, I'm letting the Tec speak
Went from sweet to hard
Beat the odds
From no hoes to show, quit the pizza job
No more fools to rob, no more geeks to rob
No more stolen cars, no more Visa cards
(Visa cards)
Slim Shady
(Slim Shady and D-12)[Verse: Eminem]
Come in spittin', with not writtin', non-fiction
Rappers try to step to this, with no prediction
It doesn't matter cause I'm smashin' and bashin' and crashin'
I hate rappers with a passion when I'm chilling with DJ Fashion
Yo, I need a frickin' kleenex, so I die like River Phoenix
When I'm chillin with Phoneix, with two Coronas
I'm on the microphone and I'm a own this
Yo, and I'm a bone this in Arizona
Yo, rappers that ain't able
That can't stay stable, I'm on two turn tables
With my man, but he doesn't matter cause he kicks lyrics galore
And he's only five foot four
Yo check it out I bust rhymes and get, groovy
My man got carded at a rated R movie
But it really didn't matter, he wasn't insulted
He said I'm 27 years old, yo, I'm an adult, kid
But, yo still, Slim Shady gets ill with the skill
And I'm a always bill and kill, my baby's mama
Just to piss the world off, just to piss the girls off
Yo I earl off
The top of the building, kill women and children
And then it hit me
Suddenly my wrists tried to slit me
Couldn't believe it, yo, ya'll can't conceive it
It's Slim Shady, I'll fuck a girl in her cleavage
Bleep that out, and you can keep it, just bleep it
Yo, y'all keep it a secret
I'm top secret, like pop secret
Rappers they don't wanna see
Slim Shady, I'm from the motherfucking, D
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-haha-ha-ha
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-haha-ha-ha
Yo, yo Slim Shady[Verse 1: Kuniva]
Yo its Kuniva, I'll cuss hoes out like a drunk sailor
And cock the hammer back like Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor
You best be on your best behavior before I slay ya
And watch the video of your life with your lord savior
I can go in off your mom, they get along when they see the gun
And dirty dozen cross my arm and it ain't a secret get scared
And be nervous, cuz I'mma be in jail in a cell with C-Murder
Shady is a general, a soldier form I showed it to him
He saved my life I owe it too him, so compare it to anybody
I serve you on a platter your words dont even matter
You all you leavin badder, I'm a hazard without bowl and loop doop
I shoot thru people at super markets while they ringin up your fruit loops
You challengers get pushed off banisters, I'm unavoidable like anvals
Droppin on toon characters

I'm the freak slasher, chop bodies up in meat packer
I reach back for the necks, choppin your feet faster
Than Steven King, I repeatedly beat bastards
The pops for result of havin a meet in maggots
When I see faggots, put three in they fleece jackets
You bleed rapid, poppin all in ya lead actors
Speed n acids when I mourn, didn't even ask for it
Technique's hazardous, you needin Jesus of Nazereth
To see what's happenin, means havin your teeth chatterin
Speak battlin, heat splatter your peeps abdomin
Sweet fashion, I reload and I keep blastin
I breathe action, if you dont believe ask him

I'm sick of bitches man, I done heard enough shit
Talk alot of mouth like they wanna do it
Then they pull down they pants and then I shoot fluid
Then they start runnin screamin like they God called them
And I called them back and then pulled a crackin in
Stick my dick up in and make them rap again
They wanna rap for me and tell me that they love me
Kon Artis your my daddy and I dont wanna be your hubby
I can't be your hub baby I ain't gettin married
I'm stand fuckin bitches, it really very scary
My lil cousin named Terry told me that I fucked him too long
And then I gotta get a Jerry curl to make 'em all keep drippin
You niggas know I never really be trippin, my beats bang
Make ears bleed thru walkmens thats why people ignore you like you ain't even talkin
You chit chatter and get splattered by a disease beat addict
That spit spontanious like a Prayin Mantis I cut you off
Pickin that gang green your man seen how I get ignorant
By losin my spleen the truth of the seen as soon as my team
Get on we rule cities like 'Zila thru Hong Kong, you wanna knew
You wanna know, you gotta ask my man Proof how the fuck the flow goes

Pull it back pull it back pull it back pull it back
We ain't wentin no where, we sippin shampane
Shady records, ain't no body better than us
Shady records, no chedder than us
Shady records, ain't no body better than us
Shady records, I got your ears goin like its sparkles in my rhymes
Hotter than a fellon in a carload full of nines
Got the sparkles out to shine, get your back up
And get your dollars out ya spines
Because the head is ill I'm in love with Natasha Betinville
Yo faster than a Porsche, make you disappear
Like advertisement in the Source, so do it baby
I want the sugar baby, my sift from the rabies
Yo Proof D12 is on the haitus, on a scale from 1-10
I'm an 8, wait you dont know how 8 is, 8 is Jigga
Thats me, 9 is Slim, 10 is Slim, now I finally give you
The time I give you to Bom Artis has got promise
And me and proof and swift and the Kon Artis
And it ain't over boy, who you beef with trust me
I'll tell you Puffy and you can lose big, cuz its that
Face it, I'm a brick face, you get it laced wit a switch blade
Yo I stab you wit a mixtape, tell ya girl ask her how my dick taste
I told you once before that I'm a brick face, I'm a big and I shine plus I spit mace
Make all the bad boys thats missin listen up yo next on this transition
And you know how it is and you know when its gravy next up
Chigga chigga Slim Shady

I done figured this rap shit out
I map shit out strategically
Timing is everything and that seems to be the key
To my success, it's worked for me repeatedly
Let 'em diss you first, and respond immediately
In order to master the art of war, don't start a war
Shit not no more, we done scared em off, there are no more
Victims to sic, I'm fixin to pick some and start shit
Ain't got no Pictures to rip and shit to throw darts at
Ain't got no more targets, shit Irv and Jeff
We done beat em to death, Benzino in debt
There seems to just be no one left to bully
Bush is pussy
Why the fuck you think his name's Bush?
Puss is bushy
Ain't shit goin on, shit I been gettin so bored lately
I'm thinkin of doin some shit to get you to go and hate me again
To tell the truth, I liked the shit better then
Shit I could spit better, I'm bout to kick this sick shit again, look
The game just ain't the same, it's changin
Shit Dre's quittin, Jay'z quittin
Now it's just wangstas just sayin the same shit
It's fake and it's ancient
It's makin me so bored, I'mma just make a new language
Fubba U cubba kubba, yubba yub yubba yooba
Yooba can subbabick my dubbibbabick through a tooba
Summaladoomalama
I'm not a human I'm a suicider supersonic suicidal unabomber
You think I'm the new Osama, Press thinks I'm the new Madonna
Jeffery Dahmer left me with his legacy to carry on
A lotta talk and rumors honest whos the hottest, to be honest
Hip hop ain't been the same since 2Pac moved to Cuba on us

Ayo
Shady records, ain't body better than us
Shady records, ain't getting more cheddar than us
Shady records, ain't nobody better than us
Shady records, mufucka more cheddar than us[Eminem (Mr. Porter)]

(This annonation was posted on unofficial lyrics of snippet)[Royce Da 5'9']
Ryan’s a homocidal misfit
I write the solution of biophysics
On the side of a cliff and some hieroglyphics
This my admission to having violence psychotic
With the vile polish politics by the way I’m higher than the Eiffel tower tip
I like writing but I will stick this pencil in your ass before I write ya shit
Pause, inhale hell n kush, us and Yelawolf like a heavy foot gas pedal push
Felon’s, crooks, going door to door like he’s selling books, Dolly Parton style, melons mush
Now my bitch dancer, I’m bout as sick as cancer
If you could swallow my style, you probably rip ya pants off
If you could bottle my style and sell it to somebody
It’d probably smell like cologne made out of bits of panther
They call me anchor man, I’ll hold down the ship
Leave you niggas floating in water and go and drown a fish
Fuck I’m fucking heinous, I’ll make you fucking famous
Them lead showers is coming, fuck is you sayin’

Fuck, it’s fucking raining, shit, it’s lightening
Bitch, its thundering, cause I’m hushing up I’m a storm if you wonderin’
Shit, shit you could muster up a thought, to take a toter? and a brain fart
Want urine in your face, all you had to do was say it
You wish you woulda just stayed pissed off in the first place
We came to monopolise the game
Illuminati is here, yeah, human oddities
At odds with us, just whats gotta be
Cause we started out cold and it snowballed
We froze, soon as we rolled up on these hoes
All’s we know is you over the bar like Limbo/ Limbaugh
You know who you are
So quit fucking the dark before we start callin’ you bizaare
Shit screw the boots, ya’ll dun raped a pitbull
Fell in love with Shih-tzu
This is directed directly at you
And as for these hoes who don’t know me from a can of paint
You must be huffin’, fuck a ballsack if the taints can’t take you on a date
You mistake me for a gentleman, your 2000 and late man, Will-I-ain't
I’m the bad guy, type of guy that will drag 5 girls up on stage
Pour ice in their pants and the first one who pee’s gets a black eye

You must be outta ya mind
You think you fucking with us
Suck on these nuts
Bitch hang it up, this game is over

Puffing loosies, watching I Love Lucy with Gary Busey
Crazy, how the fuck could you son me? I’m Shady
Will there ever come a day when they could slay me?
I don’t know, fifth month, black and yellow insect, maybe
Til then I kill the bad man tryna slay me
Everything you kick weak, your speak kung fu yazy
All my homeboys, 2.0 boys
Nickle, I just picked up a Phantom, look how it rolls, Royce!
Even if I wanted to quit, I ain’t got no choice
Verses keep coming, I should invoice my own voice
You should see the kind of asses that my pole hoist
Hoes be like diamonds in your chain, man, so moist
Bang bang bang bang, house gang, chainsaw
Here to kill you pussy’s, don’t ask what we came for
I write til my right arm vein’s sore
Forearm feel like Thor’s arm in a gang war
You hear that Yaowa, you know who finna file out
Definitively finish you, my fist stick out that eyeball
Piranha mentality with a jaws bite all night
Coming up, never saw light, but never lost sight

Jets and movers, cess-poolers, meth abusers
You step to us, text rugers to respect the shooters
My men think in sync, roll with the best crew
Move to the beat of the same drum without Lex Luger
Welcome to nay hood, bigger than jects, G
Cheated death multiple times without riggin the deck
So I’m well prepped if you just want war
There’ll be blood everywhere, you be laying on the Louboutin floor
It’s raw, you keep acting like you don’t know Mouse, nigga
And you gon’ need the best doctors, house nigga
Guard your jewels and avoid large tools
Cause after I spill you at the light, you be in a car pool
Keep your distance from idiots, cause the truth told
They food for thought’s rotten, they gems are fool’s gold
Need results from my actions, mistakes I’ll exonerate
I’m Martin King staring at a picture of Obama’s face
Talking funds, niggas ain’t never seen stock
I don’t need the key to the game, I pick a mean lock

You must be outta ya mind
You think you fucking with us
Suck on these nuts
Bitch hang it up, this game is over

Takeoff, you invited inside of the mind of a psychotic rhymer
I’m kind of a Dahmer, I’m grinding
Now rappers are lining up jackers, I’m climbing up ladders
I buy enough clappers to retire you factors, fire at drama
You liars and actors, I’m the genuine article
But read me wrong, get my gun and split you to particles, particles
Tell me when and I’m there
Not only heir to the throne, but my chair is suspended in air
Stay fly like a limited fare
You got us pegged wrong, my circle don’t fit in with squares
I smell shit and piss, know where it’s coming from
You stepped on number two just to be number one
Now I’ma step on you, bring it to yo yard
Bogart for arts, we go hard
You frauds just blow hard like broads, I coast guard the west
I’m Mozart, I compose dark shit with no heart

I got no Jim Beam in the liver
Getting head like clean clippers, with haters on my dick like a jeans zipper
When I throw up 16′s like I drink liquor
You think you seen sick? Well, bitch, you ain’t seen sicker
Then I’ll crack, and then I’ll hop around in a hospital gown
Popping the trunk, my pumper stay cocking the round
I shit logs and I piss river brown
Cause I drink creek water and spit the river Nile
And that’s as close as I get to a pyramid
Shit, they think I’m Illuminati, so f-ckin’ ignorant
Sick with a grin, here with this pen, so innocent
But when you win, they say you a sin, but in the end
They jump on the bandwagon and dance to the band playing
Skinny-ass pants sagging, it’s only yourself you playing
Call me a clown, but you love where the clown’s hanging
And the freakshow’s at the county carnival then you pay
Bitch, I’m on a trapeze with no legs in the dark
Yelling “Go Shady” driving slower than an old lady
In an old ’89, no piece if you pay me
Gimme peace sign on my grill, no Mercedes
I’m getting paid for these shows that I throw lately
Same shows a year ago woulda broken most of you crazies
They call me crazy cause I made it
Bitch, you crazy cause you quit, look at my clique lately
You ain’t fucking wit’ Budden, you ain’t got no choice with Royce
You don’t wanna see the Crooked I, well, listen to Ortiz voice
That dirt road hit the 8 Mile, the porno boys
And if Marshall want me to clap, then homie, I deploy
Game over

Yo, I don’t think they heard you, tell ‘em again
Game Over[Intro]
Ayo, what do you think about, two grown ass men, living together?
Haha, alright, what do you think about, another grown ass man
Living right upstairs from them?
Well, them two grown ass men living together on my nuts
And that's you right above them
Get the fuck off them!

Run that shit back DJ Whoo Kid!
Run that shit back one more time!

When I rhyme, somehow I think I must be subliminally throwing
Viagra at these fags that got these hard-ons for me
But I suppose anything goes when it comes to my flows
Nothing is off limits, except for Michael's nose
I didn't know, I'm so sorry, please tell me what I can do
To make it up to those of you who I offended
Ooh, I got it, I got an apology for Steve Harvey too
It's in my pocket, uh, wait, here it is: FUCK YOU!
Hey! What do you say, Andre? What's new?
Life is good, man I'm chilling, 50 how bout you?
Yayo's out of jail, Buck is out on bail, we'll get through, we always do
ODB, rest in peace, G-G-G-unit![Intro]
Yo mic-check Testing
1, 2...fuck
My dick
My nuts

My attitude is worse than NWA's was
I'll battle you over stupid shit and diss people
Who ain't have shit to do with it like Cool J does (my tattoo)
You see me standin' outside of your building
Screaming, "Puffy is good, but Slim Shady is for the children"
I look at my life in a new light, fuck it
Give me two mics, I write songs for me
Fuck what you like
You probably hear me rap half-hearted
Cause I don't like rap anyway
I'm just tryna get my porno career started
Every place and event, been there, done that
Shit, Dre stuck me in a suitcase when he went
Want a deal, study these five chapters:
Lesson One: throw demos as hard as you can at signed rappers
Lesson Two: face em and diss 'em
Don't give em a demo; kidnap 'em
And make em come to your basement and listen
Lesson Three: get a job at a label
Switch demos with Canibus and put yours on the owner's table
Lesson Four: know you heard this before
Hey let me get your number I'll call you tomorrow, for sure
Don't act like a fan, you wanna get signed
Get the whitest A&R you can find
Pull him aside and rap as whack as you can
Lesson Five: get a hook-up at Jive
Dress up like I.C.P. and have them come see you perform live
And that's the key, but when you see me on the street
I ain't giving you shit, bitch, don't even bother asking me
Toilet water splashes me right in the ass when I'm spitting
Cause I'm always shitting when I'm rapping like Master P (UNNNGGGGH)
Got a blowjob from Paula Jones
And stuffed it so far in her mouth
My balls broke both of her collarbones
Told Mya this shit was all about me-ah
Gave Alyssa Milano syphilis, mono and gonorrhea
And all three of my main girls said see-ya
Cause Brandy and Monica walked in and caught me fucking Aaliyah
I splish-splash while I'm taking a bath
Grab a handful of pills, break em in half, take em and laugh
White trash, fucking your wife in the ass
While you're out siphoning gas for your lawn mower to cut the grass

So if I hurt your self-esteem and you get dissed too bad
You know I just be saying that to get you mad
And when I rap about a buncha shit you wished you had (a big dick)
You know I just be saying that to get you mad
I can't listen to that song, that shit's too sad
You know I just be saying that to get you mad
He'll never make it, his wrist is slit too bad
You know I just be saying that to get you mad

What a wonderful day, I should go outside and play
Ain't no need to sit inside the house and hibernate
Hi Renée, I was just about to toss a live grenade
In your driveway and drive away
Are you afraid of a blade made of a razor with AIDS
Blood dripping from it
Ripping your stomach like a paper mâché
You talk alotta shit but you was never ill though
I'm sick enough to beat you to death with a feather pillow
Tipped over some cows, just for a joke and a laugh
Jumped up, choked a giraffe, snapped his neck and broke it in half
Waging wars, went on stage and sprayed Cage with Agent Orange
And wiped my ass with his page in Source
The demon is here, steaming this year
I rip [Mystikal's] voice box out and scream in his ear (AHHHHHH)
It's not a gimmick bitch; it's an image, I live it
Give a fuck, I don't know what a fuck is to give it
Yeah I don't think this guy is well, I'm high as hell
I'll beat you with a live cat when I'm swinging him by his tail
I'll fucking, I'll fucking, lay your nuts on the dresser
Just your nutsack by itself and bang them shits with a spiked bat
Cut your neck off and sew your head right back and leave you like that
You just triggered the prick who just mixed liquor
Who's itching to leave you disfigured
And stiffer than Chris-stiff-er Reeves
I was teething with strep throat, while your mother was breastfeeding
And gave her the flesh-eating disease
I'm iller than takin' a hammer and beating your knees
And walking through South Central L.A., bleeding in jeans
(Am I a Blood or a Crip)
Waking up the next day in breathing machines
Flashing back to being shot and repeating the scenes
On how you just got smoked
And if you do live, you'll be too scared to tell it like a Biggie and Pac joke

Hey yo dawg
I got some shit on my motherfuckin chest
That that I need to get off cause, if I dont
I'mma fucking explode, or somethin
Now look - this is a story about
Some little fuckin' girls that I know
It goes like this

It's so easy for me to make enemies any more it's sickening
People are lookin' for an excuse to jump on my shitlist
Stickin their noses in shit that isn't none of their business
I never asked, cared, gave a fuck, wanted opinions
Now I'm in the position that, I don't wanna be in - shit
I never had no beef with you corny son-of-a-bitches
But now the shit is broke and you can't do nothin to fix it
So I'm tellin you right now - motherfuck a Limp Bizkit
Now I'mma be real, B-Real was real
He ain't say shit the whole time me and Whitey was beefin, see he chill
He was cool with the whole situation and kept it neutral
I'd have never involved my crew if it wasn't for Pupils
Peoples, whatever your backpackin cypherin name is
Had I not opened a magazine and seen what you sayin and
I'da never involved you, but you had to add your two pennies
Now I gotta go grab my shitlist and add some new enemies
Hit the studio and I'll admit, I had a few in me
Fuck it, I roasted you, I ain't mad at you any
But let it be known that song was never released, it leaked
I'da never gave you that much attention intentionally
Then I look on the TV, now look who's mentioning me
That little fuckin weasel, DJ Lethal, on MTV
After I gave you props in that song, you on national TV
Talking bout Everlast is gonna whip my ass when he sees me?
Come on dawg, you was supposed to be on that song
Talkin bout how bad you hate him, now you all on his thong?
What's wrong? You scared, and Fred, you said you was dissin him too
I shoulda knew better than to listen to you
You fuckin sissy, up on stage, screamin how people hate you
They don't hate you
They just think you're corny since Christina played you
And I dare you motherfuckers to try to diss me back
That's a sissy act, and don't call me kissin my ass
Cause I swear to God this ain't just a song I'm tryin' to pre-warn you
Lethal when I fuckin see you dawg I'm swingin on you!
Motherfuckers must think cause I'm in trouble with the law
That I won't jaw 'em, up my sentence and double it tomorrow

Y'all some - girrrrls - y'all are some god damn girls
Why do you act this way? - Why do you act this way huh?
Why do y'all act like fuckin sissies you pussies
Keep talkin shit behind my back you just some bitches for that
And we all know - we all know
How fuckin' cowards rollll - "Keep rollin' rollin' rollin'"
In-fuckin-dent me's and pretend to be down
But as soon as someone calls you out
You put your tail between your legs and Bow Down

Now I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs, to be involved in my beefs
I'm a man, I can stand on my feet
So if you don't wanna be in 'em all I ask
Is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion
And I won't put you in 'em
Cuz I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs, to be involved in my beefs
I'm a man, I can stand on my feet
So if you don't wanna be in 'em all I ask
Is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion
And I won't put you in 'em

Now see if you diss me and I respond, the beef is on
But if I help you sell one record
And I see you at a show, I'll strip you naked
See I was smart, I came back and scooped up my friends
Now I got five dawgs that'll die for me like I'll die for them
I'll fight for them, swing or shoot like I fight for Kim
All of 'em been with me through this fucked up life that I'm in
That goes for all of my dogs, from Royce to Dre
From Xzibit to Mel-Man, 'til I'm hoist away
In my coffin I'll never soften no matter how often I'm tested
I'll never give a fuck, I won't never be interested
Love me or hate me as much as Fred wants to be hated
I will solemnly stand by every statement I stated
This shit that I been through my pencil never could pencil
But I will never be this gullible ever again no (nope)
Next time I'll know when someone's copying off me
I'm not bein cocky, I just know when somebody's mockin me
I stick up my middle finger, he sticks up his finger (hey!)
I say "Fuck Christina" he says "Fuck Christina" but meaner
So from doin a song with Method to beggin' to get accepted
I'm peggin Fred with the bottle of dye that he bleached his head with
And as for Lethal, don't forget what I said
I'm fuckin you up punk, you're dead! Don't think that I'm playin
And fuck BIZKIT! Cause I know you're saying fuck D-12
Only not to our face, under your breath, to yourselves


And that's it, that's all there is to it dawg
If you didn't wanna do the fuckin song
Don't say you're down with doin the fuckin song
And then back out at the last minute
And then go on motherfuckin MTV talkin about
Everlast can whip my motherfuckin ass
If you're scared of Whitey Ford dog
Just say you're scared of Whitey Ford, that's it
That's all you had to fuckin say, I wouldn'ta said shit
I woulda backed off, did the motherfuckin song myself
And not put you motherfuckers in it, that's all
Now I ain't even on no rap shit no more
I'm on some fuckin-you-up shit when I see you
And I will see you too; oh, and by the way Fred
That wasn't an accident
I didn't mean to give you a play at the Music Awards
Haha[Verse 1: Eminem]
My name is Chauncey Billups, I'm kind of like a raunchy Phillips
Screwdriver, my crew's liver when you can't sleep and you're still up
I get the ball and I'm like Rip, you can't get a grip
You probably got stripped, you wanna rumble, no reason to trip
I grab her like Gnarls Barkley holds the mic, your snarls spark me
I smile like Charles Barkley come on I'm hard, guard me
Ain’t booin’, ain’t pursuin’, no lawsuits, I ain’t suin’
I know what I’m doin’, give me the ball and your life is ruined
I'm like Rasheed, I remind me the spirit of Proof
I'm happy and lucky, ballin' and groovin', I'm on the move
I'm smooth with it, give me the ball, you don't know what to do with it
Shoot it in the basket, you other teams need a casket
LeBron sayin' don't respond, there's no back and forth
This game is mental, man, I play aloud and walk away just to hush the crowd
You trying to touch? Sit down

(Detroit basketball)
Homie like I told you this is(Detroit basketball)
Man I don't think you ready for the

I get the crowd rolled up Like a U-Haul truck
Just call me 2 Ball Chuck, ain't too tall what
I'll leave Utah stuffed
Man I love this game, who the hell you called up?
You need points on the paint, I'm the joints when they stained
All my coins in the bank and I'm...
Yeah baby it's true, I'm talking to you
You already know what to do
Just pass to me, it just so happens to be
That I adapt with this heat so strap in your seat
I got a grasp on this beat, you ain't convinced?
Give it to Tayshaun Prince, we haven't stayed calm since
Leave the ball with delayed palm prints


We get everybody involved homie, we get everybody involved
I said we get everybody involved homie,we get everybody involved
Yeah
Ahh
I said ahh
Give me the ball
You gotta walk before you crawl
Tell me you ain't listenin
This is Detroit basketball Homie, hey yo
Beam me up Scottie
Hahahahahahahahahahahaaaaaaaa[Intro]
And I’m willing to borrow your grass, but I specialize in eating MCs
In the immortal words of LL Cool J as he would say I'm a G.O.A.T
And for those of y'all who don't know what a goat is, it means the greatest of all time
And I consider myself one of those so thank you very much, here it goes

This is the part I was worried about
Everyone thinks that my career is down the tubes
And I'm in some dusty garage inhalin' them carbon monoxide fumes
And everyone's tellin' me what I should do
And how I should come out and what to rap about
And I know I got a lot up in my medulla oblongata that I gotta get out
And I'm not sure how this is gonna come off
They're probably gonna think that I'm comin' off as cocky
Like I just started givin' a fuck what you really think about me
See, the thing about me
Is you don't really know a thing about me
Everyone's makin' a stink about me
Like there's some kind of an aura of that of the king around me
Surround me with nothin' but gangsters, killers, and bangers
And the most dangerous criminals
And I feel like I'm more comfortable around them than I do my own motherfuckin' neighbors
But see, my dream is to be remembered as one of the best when I leave
Why does it seem like
I'm not even put up in the same category as other MCs
So when Weezy says that he's better than Jay-Z
Please be that just subliminally
Means he thinks Jigga's the best and that he's
The only one up in that league, see
And it's easy just to consider me one of the greatest white rappers there is
Knowin' goddamn well that I'm one of the best motherfuckin' rappers who ever lived, period

I'm a G.O.A.T
And I don't mean to gloat
But I know what I know and I know what you think
And these magazines'll never put it in ink
Because how would it look if they considered me as a G.O.A.T
And for those of y'all who don't know what a G.O.A.T. is
It means the greatest of all time
And I consider myself one of those
So thank you very much, here it goes

Maybe they figure that I'm on my way out the game
So they gotta go try to find 'em a new Eminem
Or a new Shady, if they think it's gonna happen
Man, I thought I was crazy
Or maybe I could be takin' it wrong and they're tryna pay homage to me in a strange way
So let me pay homage to my fellow white competitors almost in the same way
See, you hardly ever do hear anyone even bringin' up that Paul Wall's white
Cause lyrically he doesn't pose a threat to anyone, see, he's just aight
And Bubba Sparxxx, he just won't write
Because he's so caught up in that snow white
That Timbaland can't even get him in the studio
He's so gone off that coke, right
And it's so sad, cause he's dope, right
America's next great white hope, right
So now they feel like they gotta come up with
Some corny-ass White Rapper Show, right
And which I'm still havin' mixed feelings about
They said it'd be real, I'm just spillin' it out
There's somethin' about a white boy talking black
And runnin' around with a damn grill in his mouth
And I love when the say that Tiger Woods shit
Isn't it ironic that the best rapper's white and the best golfer's black
And I'm the one who's gotta catch all the flack offa' that
But these are the people who
Never had heard of an Eminem until 8 Mile had came out
But I had already hit middle America
Parents had all got to likin' me now
When suddenly I wasn't such a bad guy
All of the hatred for me must've died
Thought I committed career suicide so I had to turn back into the bad guy
So faggoty faggoty faggoty gays
Anatomy God made Raggedy Ann and Andy
Not Raggedy Andy and Andy and Andy
And Angelina Jolie is just another ho
And Brad is a sucka because once I fuck her
She wants to go to Somalia to adopt another baby
You know what I say? No
You better save some of them kids from Madonna
She needs all the publicity she can get
You want a Shady
Well, you got it, man
I ain't apologizin' for shit


Man, I'm takin' my ball and goin' home, man
Shit is too easy
Nobody even wants to pass me the ball cause I'M A GOAT
So don't worry, I'm out the motherfuckin' game
And y'all can sit and argue about who's the motherfuckin' best
But y'all know that I'M A GOAT
And like I said, I'm one of the motherfuckin' best
Before you get your panties in a motherfuckin' bunch
But before I go, I'd like to say fuck you very much
To everybody who wasn't there from the start
And thank you very much to everybody who was
And y'all ain't gotta say it, just think it
Cause I know that you know that I know that you know that I know that you know that I'M A GOAT
I'm out, y'all
It's been real, peace[Hook]
I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes

Lately I really, feel like I'm rolling for delph like Philly
Feel like I'm losing control of myself, I sincerely
Apologize if all that I sound like is I'm complaining
But life keeps on complicating, and
I'm debating on leaving this world this evening
Even my girls can see I'm grieving, I try and hide it but I can't
Why do I act like I'm all high and mighty
When inside, I'm dying, I am finally realizing I need help
I can't do it by myself, too weak
2 weeks I've been having ups and downs
Going through peaks and valleys, dilly dallying
Around with the idea, of ending the shit right here
I'm hatin my reflection, I walk around the house tryna fight mirrors
I can't stand what I look like, yeah, I look fat, but what do I care?
I give a fuck, only thing I fear, is Hailie
I'm afraid if I close my eyes I might see her...shit


I lock myself in the bedroom, bathroom, napping at noon
Yeah dad's in a bad mood, he's always snapping at you
Marshall what happened that you, you can't stop with these pills
And you've fallen off with your skills, and your own fans are laughing at you
It become a problem you're too pussy to tackle, get up
Be a man, stand, a real man would've had this shit handled
Know you just had your heart ripped out and crushed
They say Proof just flipped out, homie just whipped out and bust
Nah, it ain't like Doody to do that
He wouldn't fuckin' shoot at, no-body, he fights first
But dwelling on it only makes the night worse
Now I'm popping Vics, Percs and Methadone pills
"Yeah Em, tight verse, you killed it"
Fucking drug dealers hang around me like yes men
And they gonna do whatever I says when, I says it
It's in their best interest to protect their investment
And I just lost my fuckin' best friend, so fuck it, I guess then:


My friends can't understand this new me
That's understandable man, but think how bananas you'd be
You'd be an animal too
If you were trapped in this fame and caged in it like a zoo
And everybody's looking at you, what you want me to do?
I'm starting to live like a recluse and the truth is
Fame starting to give me an excuse, to be at an all-time low
I sit alone in my home theater, watching the same damn DVD
Of the first tour, the last tour, he was still alive
And it hurts so I...fast forward, sleeping pills'll make me feel alright
And if I'm still awake in the middle of the night
I just take a couple more, yeah you're motherfuckin' right
I ain't slowing down for no one, I am almost homeward bound
Almost in a coma, yeah homie c'mon, dole 'em out
"Daddy, don't you die on me; Daddy, better hold your ground!"
Fuck, don't I know the sound of that voice
Yeah baby hold me down


Wake up in the hospital, full of tubes, but somehow I'm pulling through
Swear when I come back I'mma be bulletproof
I'mma do it just for Proof, I think I should state a few
Facts, cause I may not get a chance again to say the truth
Shit it just hit me that what if I would not have made it through
I think about the things I would never got to say to you
I'd never get to make it right, so here's what I came to do
Hailie this one is for you, Whitney and Alaina too
I still love your mother, that'll never change
Think about her every day, we just could never get it together
Hey, wish there was a better way, for me to say it
But I swear on everything, I'd do anything for her on any day
There are just too many things to explain
When it rains guess it pours, yes it does
Wish there wasn't any pain, but I can't pretend there ain't
I ain't placing any blame, I ain't pointing fingers
Heaven knows I've never been a saint
I know it just feels like we just pissed away our history
And just today, I looked at your picture, almost hate to say
I miss you sub consciously, wish it didn't end this way
But I just had to get away, don't know why
I don't know what else to say, I guess I'm[Hook: Proof]

I done figured this rap shit out, I map shit out strategically
Timing is everything and it seems to be the key
To my success I've murked for me-uh... (slurs words) repeatedly
(Laughter and slurs words) to beat MCs
Timing is everything and it seems to be the key
Let 'em diss you first and respond immediately
In order to master the art of war, don't start a war
Shit not no more, we done scared 'em off, there are no more
Victims to sic, I'm fixin' to pick some and start shit
Ain't got no pictures to rip and shit to throw darts in
Ain't got no more targets, shit Irv and Jeff
We done beat 'em to death, Benzino in debt
It seems to just be no one left to bully, Bush is pussy
Why the fuck you think his name's Bush? Puss is bushy
Ain't shit going on, shit I been gettin' so bored lately
I'm thinkin' of doing some shit to get you to go and hate me again
Tell the truth I like the shit better then
Shit I can spit better, I'm bout to kick that shi-shit again
Look, the game just ain't the same, it's changin'
Shit Dre's quittin', Jay's quittin', now it's just wanksta
Sayin' the same shit, it's fake and it's ancient
It's makin' me so bored I'ma just make a new language
Fubba you cubba cubba, ubbu you ubbu ooba
Yooba can subba my dibidick through a tubba
Suma newma lama, I'm not a human
I'm a suicidal super sonic suicidal uni-bomber
You think I'm the new Osama, press think I'm the new Madonna
Jeffrey Domer left me with his legacy to carry on, uh
Lotta talk and rumors on us, who's the hottest? To be honest
Hip-hop ain't been the same since 2Pac moved to Cuba on us

Ayy yo

Verse One [Eminem]:
Yo
At birth I was born with the biggest middle finger on earth
The first time I went to stick it up the shit hurt
Mom wouldn't take me
The bitch still hates me
Shit, one day she said, "Go rake leaves,"
I said, "Make me!"
I'm proud to announce I was probably the first kid
Who was kicked out of his house
For making fart sounds with his mouth
Arguing with me and mom was on-going
She called law enforcement when I broke the law mower
The slut gave me a truck when I turned sixteen
I went to start it and it screamed, "Please fix me!"
Back then, when Will Smith was still the Fresh Prince
And him and Jeff were still best friends, I guess then
I decided to cut class to rap full time
And get the fuck outta this fake ass school and rhyme
Anybody who thinks this fuckin attitude is a gimmick
Come and see me, see if I don't live up to this image
You fuckin' pricks!

Scratching:

"No...you hear me! You go to hell" -] Mr. Garrison

Verse Two [Obie Trice]:
How the fuck you gonna fuck with O Trice with a staff full of hoes
With one gat and a wack stack of flows?
A whole lot of lip
Thicker than Obie's shit
Oh shit they found your ass floatin' in the ocean
Body part corroded
Cast away
You stretched in a cast today
That's how a real bastard play
Do shit the bachelor way
Creek niggas will blast away
Y'all niggas ain't tough
Y'all niggas funny
Y'all need to roll on WB 20
Niggas think they 2Pacalypse Now
Until they catch a buckshot
Chicken pop a nigga's style
Niggas scared of the firm
Slim, Dirty Dozen and Trice
Come back like thieves in the night
Niggas jump, that's reason to fight
That's reason to rearrange your teeth with the right
Motherfucker[Verse 1: Eminem]
I ain't gonna eat, I ain't gonna sleep
Ain't gonna breathe, 'til I see what I wanna see
And what I wanna see, is you go to sleep in the dirt
Permanently, you just being hurt
This ain't gonna work for me
It just wouldn't be, sufficient enough
Cause we, are just gonna be, enemies
As long as we breathe, I don't ever see, either of us
Coming to terms, where we can agree
There ain't gonna be, no reasoning, speaking wit me
You speak on my seed, then me, no speak-a ingles
So we gonna beef, and keep on beefing, unless
You're gonna agree, to meet with me in the flesh
And settle this face to face, and you're gonna see
A demon unleashed in me, that you've never seen
And you're gonna see, this gangster pee on himself
I see you D12, and thanks, but me need no help
Me do this one all by my lonely
I don't need fifteen of my homies
When I see you, I'm seeing you, me and you only
We never met, but best believe you gon' know me
When I'm this close, to see you exposed as phony
Come on bitch, show me, pick me up, throw me
Lift me up, hold me, just like you told me
You was gonna do, that's what I thought, you're pitiful
I'm rid of you, all of you, Ja, you'll get it too!

Now go to sleep bitch
Die, motherfucker, die
Ugh, time's up, bitch, close ya eyes
Go to sleep, bitch (what)
Why are you still alive
How many times I gotta say, close ya eyes
And go to sleep bitch (what)
Die motherfucker die, bye, bye, motherfucker, bye, bye
Go to sleep bitch (what)
Why are you still alive
Why, die motherfucker, ah, ah, ah
Go to sleep bitch

We got you niggas nervous
On purpose, to hurt your focus
You's not MC's, you's worthless
You's not them G's, you's a circus
You's no appeal, please
You's curtains, you use words Kool Herc slurred in two thousand third
You's purping, you's no threat, who's ya serving
When lyrically oughta bury you beneath the dirt when
You fuck with a label overseeing the Earth
Shady muthafucka, O. Trice's birth
And as I mold, I become a curse
So we can put down the verse, take it to the turf
Cock and squeeze, and he who reach the hearse is he who
Depicts fiction in his verse
And as I breathe, and you be deceased
The world believe you deceived just to speak
You's not the streets, you's the desk
Use not your chest nigga, use a vest
Before two's choose ya rest, you chose death
Six feet deep, nigga, that's the depth


Hey dog, I'mma walk like a beast, talk like the streets
I'mma stay blazing New York with the heat
Stalk on the beat, walk with my feet
Understand my pain, the rain ain't sleet
Peep how I'm moving, peep where I'm going
Shit don't seep, then sleep not knowing
But I'mma keep growing, getting larger than life
Easy going with the same one that started the fight
He be knowing how dog get, when dog don't bite
Tried to show him the dog shit, it's dog for life
Grand Champ, and my Blood Line is tight
Cuz it's all good, it's all right
Niggas tried to holla, but couldn't holla back
Now they gots to swallow, everything in the sac
Blood Line, and, we can go track for track
Damn, dog, why'd you have to do them niggas like that


All you motherfuckers, take that
Here, take this too, bitch
Uh, Uh, Uh, Uh, Wahoo
We're killing all you motherfuckers dead, all of you
Fake ass gangsters
No more press
No more press
Rot, motherfuckers, rot
Decay, in the dirt, bitch, in the motherfucking dirt
Die nameless, bitch, die nameless, no more fame
Ahh, hahahaha
Yo X, come on man, Obie, let's go, haha[Eminem]
Met a retarded kid name Greg, with a wooden leg
Snatched it off and beat him over the head with the peg
Go to bed with a keg, wake up with a 40
Mix it with Alka Seltzer and formula 44-D
Forget an acid tab, I'll strap the whole sheet to my forehead
Waited 'til it absorbed in fell to the floor dead
No more said, case closed, end of discussion
We blowin up like spontaneous human combustion
Leavin you in the aftermath of holocaust and traumas
Cross tha bombers
We blowin up your house, killin your parents, and comin back to get your foster mommas
And I'm as good at keepin a promise as Nostradamus
Cause I ain't makin no more threats
Im doin drive-bys in tinted Corvettes on Vietnam war vets
Im more or less sick in the head, maybe more
Cause I smoked crack today, yesterday, and the day before
Saboteur, walk the block with a labrador
Strapped with more corral for war than El Salvador
Foul style galore, verbal cow manure
Comin' together like an eyebrow on Al B. Sure![Intro]
"What is a nightmare?
The dictionary tells us it is a terrifying dream, a nightmare"

I used to think I had bad luck, but I wasn't superstitious
'til one day I grew suspicious, when I stepped on a crack
On Aunt Edna's stoop and got pooped on by a group of stupid pigeons
Then we flew the coop to Michigan to start anew,  but ditching
Missouri for Michigan didn't work, so we moved
Back to Missouri from Michigan, from Missouri back to Michigan
Someone put me out my misery, I can't do this again
Mom, please stick to a decision, discipline, last thing I wanna do is listen
She's like Lex Luthor, bitch, her rules are Krypton-
-ite, so the walls - I done lost my power to see through them bitches
But I run into 'em, running through the kitchen
Pretending to be blind Superman, cause I had no supervision
But I did have a super power though, I could turn into invisible kid
Disappear out of sight, like a true magician
And one day Uncle Ronnie brought over this new, but different
Music into the picture and it became my new religion

"I remember it clearly, even today"

Move back to Michigan again, to live with my Grandma Nan
Always itching for something to do
Was flipping through the radio stations one day and discovered
This DJ who was mixing, I say it to this day, if you ain't listened
To the Wizzard, you ain't have a fucking clue what you was missing
I'd zone out with my headphones, all I remember doing's wishing for shoes
Fuck them stupid Pumas bitch, it's all about them new edition Troops
You get them LL Cool J cooling system
Made that final maneuver to 8 Mile and Hoover
And somehow I saw my future is in this, that's how I know my mission
Little boom box booming, spitting, practicing numerous writtens
When I sit in my room envisioning my dreams come to fruition
I remember Proof would visit, couldn't wait to play him my new shit
He'd go cuckoo ballistic, go through the roof for his shit
It's like we knew the instant, we touched a mic that both of us
Too existed to do this shit, never quit, too persistent

"We are the underground empire"

Started a group of misfits, Proof had a proposition
If we all band together, there ain't no stopping this shit
Come up with aliases, bipolar opposites and
Be ready to come off the top as sharp precision
If you got dissed at the Shop, cause if they caught you slipping
They'd take your spot if someone got to ripping you
And you forgot your written
Opportunity knocks once, it ain't knocking again
It tried ding-dong ditching shit, I fucking got that bitch in a headlock
Cut off his oxygen, Slim is not budging
Like cocksucking cynderblocks in the wind, now I got a pot to piss in
Spot in that top position, kopping over the opposition
Looking like a dog that's pissing, leg up on the competition
Promising complete dominance, Sugar Ray Robinson
I'm in a league Muhammad's in, Ali's my colleague bombing 'em
Probably end up on top of 'em, stomping 'em like Ndamukong
I'm Russian like a Ukrainian, LaDainian Tomlinson
Flow vomits in your face, competitors fall at my waist
You spit a rhyme, I spit in a rhyme's face
So name the time, place to battle bitch, I'm still in that mind state
Don't make me step on you and make you wine grapes
Cry babies, maybe my way that I use words is loose
But you turds better be careful how you choose yours
Cause feelings scar, but egos bruise worse
And the truth hurts, shit no wonder you're sore losers
Now where's your poo, birds? Ooh
No more tripping in bird shit, songs of self-empowerment surging
Words of encouragement, but discouraging the rappers
The Rap Game's God, but the name's not James Todd, I'm just a wordsmith
So let these words lift, cause all I got is bars
For you dumbbells, since yours ain't working out
Each verse is more merciless than the first is, and you ain't got to wear
No shoes and shirt in this bitch to get served, bloodthirst revenge of the nerds

"That you'll not escape my vengeance"

And I'm the kid with them ears like Dumbo's gone
Word to Uncle Ron, I'm turning into a non-humble Don
You blind dumb hoes, all I got is dick for you to come blow on
So start the show, but I need a drum roll 'fore I go on
Better back away from the front row, get launched, show you I'm
Bigger than Dikembe Mutumbo on the fucking Jumbotron
I'm a juggernaut, you do not wanna rumble, you Bomboclaat
I'll leave you stretched out, like a fucking yawn
So mow the fucking lawn, your asses are blades of grass
And I'm fucking up this whole landscape of rap
The GOAT just ate eight acres, an eighth of that
Was just to make a path and take it straight to your favorite rapper
Oh, look, my notebook looks smoke cooked
Like the flow stood a foot over the flame on the stove
Soot, charred debris floating like Oakwood
Was burning, return of the no good and I won't quit

"And the next thing I know something came crawling up from below
Something that made Godzilla look like a plane"

And I don't quit, won't change, it's like a Groundhog's Day
So crowd around y'all, cause you may, see if I popped your head

I'm a monster... I'mma turn into a monster
I'm a monster with my dick in your mouth all day!

"I'm not so sure I want to know from whence it came
But the white flesh creature's trail is easily followed
There, before that shimmering veil of light, the ivory skin slug thing"[Produced by Dr. Dre]

Meet Eddie, twenty-three years old. Fed up with life and the way things are going, he decides to rob a liquor store. But on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart and suddenly his conscience comes into play

Alright stop, now before you walk in the door
Of this liquor store and try to get money out the drawer
You better think of the consequence (But who are you?)
I'm your mothafuckin' conscience!

That's nonsense
Go in, gaffle the money and run to one of your Aunt's cribs
And borrow a damn dress and one of her blond wigs
Tell her you need a place to stay, you'll be safe for days
If you shave your legs with Renee's razor blades

Yeah but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
Think about it before you walk in the door first
Look at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns!

Fuck that, do that shit, shoot that bitch
Can you afford to blow this shit, are you that rich?
Why you give a fuck if she dies? Are you that bitch?
Do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids?

Man don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it (You're right!)
Not over this shit, drop the biscuit (I will!)
Don't even listen to Slim yo, he's bad for you
(You know what Dre, I don't like yo attitude)

These voices, these voices, I hear them
And when they talk, I follow, I follow
I follow, I follow all these voices

Meet Stan, 21 years old. After meeting a young girl at a rave party, things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom. Once again, his conscience comes into play

Now listen to me, while you're kissing her cheek
And smearing her lipstick, slip this in her drink
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitch's earlobe
(Yo, this girl's only fifteen years old
You shouldn't take advantage of her, it's not fair)
Yo, look at her bush, does it got hair?
Fuck this bitch right here on the spot, bare
'til she passes out and she forgot how she got there
(Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie, Kids?)
No but I seen the porno with Sun Doobiest!
(Shit, you wanna get hauled off to jail?)
Man, fuck that, hit that shit raw dog and bail


Meet Grady, a 29-year-old construction worker. After coming home from a hard day's work, he walks in the door of his trailer park home to find his wife in bed with another man (What the fuck?)

Alright, calm down, relax, start breathing
(Fuck that shit, you just caught this bitch cheating
While you at work she's with some dude trying to get off
Fuck slitting her throat, cut this bitch's head off!)
Wait, what if there's an explanation for this shit?
(What, she tripped, fell, landed on his dick?)
Alright, Shady, maybe he's right Grady
But think about the baby before you get all crazy

Okay, thought about it? Still wanna stab her?
Grab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her?
That's what I did, be smart don't be a retard
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped Dee Barnes?
(What you say?) What's wrong? Didn't think I'd remember?
(I'ma kill you, mothafucka!) Uhh-ahh, temper, temper
Mr. Dre, Mr. N.W.A, Mr. AK
Coming straight outta Compton, y'all better make way
How in the fuck you gonna tell this man not to be violent?

Cause he don't need to go the same route that I went
Been there, done that, aw fuck it, what am I saying?
Shoot 'em both Grady, where's your gun at?[Interlude: Mark Avery]

Feels like a close, it's coming to, fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I, thing I know

Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is
Find different ways to word the same old song
Ever since I came along
From the day the song called, ‘’Hi! My Name Is’’ dropped
Started thinking my name was Fault
Cause any time things went wrong
I was the one who they would blame it on
The media made me the e-quivalent of a modern-day Genghis Khan
Tried to argue, it was only entertainment, dog
Gangster? Nah, courageous balls
Had to change my style, they said I'm way too soft
And I sound like AZ and Nas, out came the claws
And the fangs been out since then
But up until the instant, that I went against it
It was ingrained in me that I wouldn't amount to a shitstain
I thought
No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught
Do I really belong in this game? I pondered
I just wanna play my part, should I make waves or not?
So back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on
And I don't wanna seem ungrateful or disrespect the artform I was raised up on
But sometimes you gotta take a loss
And have people rub it in your face before you get made pissed off
And keep plugging, it's your only outlet
And your only outfit, so you know they gonna talk about it
Better find a way to counter it quick and make it... ah
Feel like I've already said this a kabillion eighty times
How many times can I say the same thing different ways that rhyme?
What I really wanna say is
If there's anyone else that can relate to my story
Bet you feel the same way I felt
When I was in the same place you are
When I was afraid to…

I was a... afraid to make a single sound
Afraid I would never find a way out, out, out
Afraid I'd never be found
I didn't wanna go another round
An angry man's power will shut you up
Trip wires fill this house with tip-toed love
Run out of excuses for everyone
So here I am and I will not run

Guts over fear, the time is near
Guts over fear, I shed a tear
For all the times I let you push me 'round, I let you keep me down
Now I got, guts over fear, guts over fear

Feels like a close, it's coming to, fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I, thing I know

I know what it was like, I was there once, single parents
Hate your appearance
As you struggle to find your place in this world
And the pain spawns all the anger on
But it wasn't 'til I put the pain in song, learned who to aim it on
That I made a spark, started to spit hard as shit
Learned how to harness it while the reins were off
And there was a lot of bizarre shit, but the crazy part
Was soon as I stopped saying I gave a fuck
Haters started to appreciate my art
And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I caused
But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone?
And the lights go out in that trailer park
And the window is closing
And there's nowhere else that I can go with flows
And I'm frozen, cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from
Just a bunch of playful songs, that I make for fun
So, to the break of dawn, here I go recycling the same old song
But I rather make “Not Afraid 2”
Than make another motherfuckin' “We Made You”
Now I don't wanna seem indulgent
When I discuss my lows and my highs
My demise and my uprise, pray to God
I just open enough eyes later on
And gave you the supplies and the tools
To hopefully use that'll make you strong
Enough to lift yourself up, when you feel like I felt
Cause I can't explain to y'all how dang exhausted my legs felt
Just having to balance my dang self
When on eggshells, I was made to walk
But thank you, ma, cause that gave me the
Strength to cause Shady-mania, so when they empty that stadium
Least I made it out of that house
And found a place in this world when the day was done
So this is for every kid who all's they ever did was dreamt of one day just getting accepted
I represent him or her, anyone similar
You are the reason that I made this song
And everything you're scared to say don't be afraid to say no more
From this day forward, just let them a-holes talk
Take it with a grain of salt and eat their fucking faces off
The legend of the angry blonde lives on through you when I’m gone
And to think I was a...

I was a... afraid to make a single sound
Afraid I would never find a way out, out, out
Afraid I'd never be found
I didn't wanna go another round
An angry man's power will shut you up
Trip wires fill this house with tip-toed love
Run out of excuses for everyone
So here I am and I will not run

Guts over fear, the time is near
Guts over fear, I shed a tear
For all the times I let you push me 'round, I let you keep me down
Now I got, guts over fear, guts over fear[Intro]
Yo, I can't sing but... I feel like singing, I wanna fuckin' sing
Cause I'm happy.. yeah, I'm happy! I got my baby back
Yo, check it out

Somedays I sit, staring out the window
Watching this world pass me by
Sometimes I think, there's nothing to live for
I almost break down and cry
Sometimes I think I'm crazy, I'm crazy, oh so crazy
Why am I here? Am I just wasting my time?
But then I see my baby, suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes

Cause sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin on me
Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me

My baby girl, keeps getting older
I watch her grow up with pride
People make jokes, cause they don't understand me
They just don't see my real side
I act like shit don't faze me, inside it drives me crazy
My insecurities could eat me alive
But then I see my baby, suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes


Man if I could sing, I'd keep singing this song to my daughter
If I could hit the notes, I'd blow something as long as my father
To show her how I feel about her, how proud I am that I got her
God, I'm a daddy, I'm so glad that her mom didn't *want her*
Now you probably get this picture from my public persona
That I'mma pistol packing drug addict who bags on his mama
But I wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest
Cause there's a lotta shit I keep bottled that hurts deep inside of my soul
And just know that I grow colder the older I grow
This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold
And this load is like the weight of the world and I think my neck is breaking
Should I just give up or try to live up to these expectations?
Now look, I love my daughter more than life in itself
But I got a wife that's determined to make my life living hell
But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt
So many chances man, it's too bad, coulda had someone else
But the years that I've wasted is nothin to the tears that I've tasted
So here's what I'm facing, three felonies, six years of probation
I've went to jail for this woman, I've been to bat for this woman
I've taken bats to people's backs, bent over backwards for this woman
Man, I shoulda seen it coming, what'd I stick my penis up in?
Wouldn't have ripped the pre-nup up if I'da seen what she was fucking
But fuck it, it's over, there's no more reason to cry no more
I got my baby, baby the only lady that I adore, Hailie
So sayonara, try tommorrow, nice to know ya
Our baby's traveled back to the arms of her rightful owner
And suddenly it seems like my shoulder blades have just shifted
It's like the greatest gift you can get, the weight has been lifted

And now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leaning on me
Cause my baby knows that her daddy's a soldier
Nothing can take her from me

Wooo! Told you I can't sing, oh well, I tried
Hailie, remember when I said, if you ever need anything
Daddy would be right there? Guess what?
Daddy's here, and I ain't going nowhere baby
I love you {*smooch*}[Intro: Eminem]
Makaveli rest in peace
Irv Gotti, too much Bacardi in his body
Mouth like a 12 gauge shotty
And Ja said he should be
The lost forgotten seed of 2Pac
To lead this industry into the ways of the man
Follow me!

Come get me
If you motherfuckers want Shady
If Pac was still here now
He would never ride with Ja
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na

You ain't no killer, you a pussy
That Ecstasy done got you all emotional and mushy
Bitches wearing rags in photos, Ja's words being quoted
In The Source, stealing Pac's shit like he just wrote it
You loud mouths pray to god hoping no one's listening
See 50 coming for me, Oh my god ma, my position
No one will pay attention to me
Please Gotti, here I go, give me this pill
Ecstasy done got me feeling so invincible
Now all of a sudden I'm a fucking madman who screams
Like I'm Pac but I'm not, enemies, Hennessey
Acting like I'm great, but I'm fake, I'm crazy
Sweat drip, get me off this trip, someone stop this train
Some say my brain is all corrupted, fucked from this shit
I'm stuck, I'm addicted to these drugs, I'mma quit
Saying motherfuckers names before somebody fucks me up
Ain't no pussies over here, partner, see you in hell, fucker


Get off that E
Before you try to come and fuck with me
It's Aftermath here now
Shady Records got it locked
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-locked

Penitentiaries is packed with promise makers
Never realized the precious time that bitch niggas is wasting
Institutionalized, my bitches bring me product by the bundles
Hustle hard from a cell, G-Unit motherfucker, we balling
Catch me counting trees and when I'm calling, can you set my call
CEO let me sip on Hennessey, can I sip some more
Hell, I done been to jail, I ain't scared
Mama checking in my bedroom, I ain't there
I got a head with no screws in it
Motherfuckers thinking they can stop 50, they losing it
Lil' nigga named Ja think he live like me
Talking 'bout he left the hospital, took 9 like me
You live in fantasies nigga, I reject your deposit
When your lil' sweet ass gon' come out of the closet?
Now he wondering why DMX blowed him out
Next time grown folks talking bitch, close your mouth
Peep me, I take this war shit deeply
Done seen too many real niggas ball to let these bitch niggas beat me
Black, you's a motherfucking punk and you can see me with gloves
Quit scaring them fucking kids with your ugly ass mug
And you can tell them niggas you roll with whatever you want
But you and I know what's going on
Nigga payback, Tah, I know your bitch ass from way back
Witnessed me strapped with Macs, you know I don’t play that
All these old rappers trying to advance
It's all over now, take it like a man
Irv looking like Larry Holmes, flabby and sick
Trying to playa hate on my shit, man eat a fat dick
Loving this shit that's how you made me
Feeling like I got you niggas crazy
Against all odds, hoping my thug motherfuckers know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote
Against all odds, up in the studio getting blow
To the truest shit I ever spoke
21 gun salute

I've been one of the most humble, rep the streets to the core
Hey Jeffrey, what the fuck you come involving me for
It's been a long time coming, like a bless and a check
You see 106 and Park fans don't even fucking respect you
It's kinda funny, wannabe Pac, wanna fake like you thug
Running around talking shit that he ain't capable of
Now let me off this cocksucker whilst we handle you, nigga
If I recall, Violator use to manage you, nigga
Then took a closer look and realized you was an impostor
There's never been a Violator on a Murda Inc roster
Dumb ass, now who's shooting?
Ah made you look
You said Bus singing the same old hook, you stupid
If y'all shooting
I take a look at your man, the bitch shot himself in front of Def Jam
Cheddar Bob ass nigga start adjusting your plan
You let the streets down nigga, 'pologize to your fans
Watch you pull a little stunt like we ain't know what it was
Little faggot desperate trying to re-establish a buzz
I know the shit is driving you crazy, you wondering how
The streets ain't never want you Beatrice, what you gonna do now
Now if you wanna beef with me, then I'm beefing with you
I think about the game and what it's like and what would it be without you
I'm finished, I ain't trying to repeat this
JJust cause I'm cool, you shouldn't take my kindness for weakness

It was fun
Next time you got a problem with me
Address me before you try to make shit a public issue homie
And I'mma return back to my regular self
And have fun again
One

Hahaha, BITCH! Haha
OUTLAWZ, haha
Makaveli the don, haha
Since you want to be 2Pac, motherfucker, hahaha
2Pac shoes too big for you to walk in you lil' faggot, hahaha

(What do we have here now?)[Intro]
Roll down the window in the chevy and I listen to the critics but they really Wasn't saying shit
Buddy, I'm a gutter motherfucker from an Alabama creek, you don't know
Who you're playin' with, They talk so much that I bet one of these pebbles under me get
Laryngitis the wave is so contagious, so who gave it? Apparently I did
Put fish in the back of my boat, I'm a fisherman, I'm a reel 'em in, mackerel
I'm a give 'em ten minutes,Then put 'em back in the water there, just to see 'em all float
And kinda like mixtapes in the back on my trunk, buddy, yeah, I got 'em all sold
In Alabama with an arm and hammer, swimmin' in propaganda, I got 'em all, whoa
Promenade, country boy, get out of my way, gallon of sweet tea, a packet of lemonade
Smackin' a faggot, I crack a bat on the pen and page, no homo, anyway Any stage, rip it any
Way the independent way, look, have you seen his Js?
Footwork, send em' in a rage, feelin' like a millionaire on minimum wage don't need a Mercedes
To take your girl, my Chevy is sick, Earl
I let her play with my mullet, while she sip syrup
Hold up, Alabama funk make you lose your teeth like a Mountain Dew soda
Some saltines wanna live in the box, but guess what? I'm the cracker who showed up


Cause sometimes I feel like its so hard
For me to come up with shit to say. Aay!
I'm at a loss for words cause ya'll already said it all
I think I'm runnin' out of cliches
I'm gettin' writer's block. Psyche!

Left the crib with 10 grand bought a hundred pair
I'm the coach I can show you how to be a player
5 faces said the fitted bitches love my hair
Camo shorts go with anything I wanna wear
They let me in the club fuck the dress code
Me and all my niggas rollin' up the best smoke
OG kush from the west coast
Oh you down to fuck? well shorty lets go
Diamonds in my chain niggas tryna steal my lane
Chronic in my brain bitch I'm reppin' Taylor gang
Smoke till I'm insane drinkin' till I'm throwin' up
Only papers if you Taylor'd nigga throw it up
High socks low cuts smell that good weed then you know its us
That yellow car pullin up them niggas ain't hot so they ain't close to us
Down to fly get two fingers and throw em' up


Cause sometimes I feel like its so hard
For me to come up with shit to say. Aay!
I'm at a loss for words cause ya'll already said it all
I think I'm runnin' out of cliches
I'm gettin' writer's block. Psyche!
I'm gettin' writer's block. Psyche!
I'm gettin' writer's block. Psyche!
I'm gettin' writer's block. Psyche!I'm the illest rapper to hold the cordless, patrolling corners
Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
I'm meaner in action than Roscoe beating James Todd Sr
Across the back with vacuum cleaner attachments
I grew up in a wild hood, as a hazardous youth
With a fucked up childhood, that I used as an excuse
And ain't shit changed, I kept the same mindstate
Since the third time that I failed 9th grade
You probably think that I'm a negative person, don't be so sure of it
I don't promote violence, I just encourage it
I laugh at the sight of death
As I fall down a cement flight of steps
And land inside a bed of spider webs
So throw caution to the wind; you and a friend
Can jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again
Shit, why not, blow your brain out, I'm blowin' mine out
Fuck it, you only live once, you might as well die now![Intro: Nate Ruess]
Mom, I know I let you down
And though you say the days are happy
Why is the power off and I'm fucked up and
Mom, I know he's not around
But don't you place the blame on me
As you pour yourself another drink, yeah

I guess, we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

I went in headfirst, never thinking about who what I said hurt
In what verse, my mom probably got it the worst, the brunt of it
But as stubborn as we are, did I take it too far, "Cleaning Out My Closet"
And all them other songs, but regardless I don't hate you
Cause ma, you're still beautiful to me, cause you're my mom
Though far be it from you to be calm, our house was Vietnam
Desert Storm and both of us put together could form an atomic bomb
Equivalent to chemical warfare and forever we could drag this on and on
But, agree to disagree, that gift for me up under the Christmas tree
Don't mean shit to me, you're kicking me out? It's 15 degrees and
It's Christmas Eve, "Little prick, just leave," ma, let me grab my fucking coat
Anything to have each other's goats, why we always at each others throats
'specially when dad, he fucked us both, we're in the same fucking boat
You'd think that'd make us close, nope further away it drove us, but together
Headlights shine, and a car full of belongings
Still got a ways to go back to grandma's house, it's straight up the road
And I was the man of the house, the oldest, so my shoulders carried
The weight of the load, then Nate got taken away by the state at eight years old
And that's when I realized you were sick and it wasn't fixable or changeable
And to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though, but...

I guess, we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though
Cause you ain't even get to witness your grandbabies grow
But I'm sorry momma for "Cleanin' Out My Closet"
At the time I was angry, rightfully? Maybe so
Never meant that far to take it though
Cause, now I know it's not your fault and I'm not making jokes
That song I no longer play at shows and I cringe every time it's on the radio
And I think of Nathan being placed in a home
And all the medicine you fed us and how I just wanted you to taste your own
But now the medication's taking over
And your mental state's deteriorating slow and I'm way too old to cry
The shit is painful though but ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan, yo
All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both
Foster care, that cross you bear, few may be as heavy as yours
But I love you, Debbie Mathers, oh, what a tangled web we have
Cause, one thing I never asked was where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
Fuck it, I guess he had trouble keeping up with every address
But I'd have flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus
Owned a collection of maps and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
If someone ever moved 'em from me, that you could've bet your asses
If I had to come down the chimney dressed as Santa, kidnap 'em
And although one has only met their grandma, once you pulled up
In our drive one night, as we were leaving to get some hamburgers
Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you
And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness
Come over me as we pulled off to go our separate paths
And I saw your headlights as I looked back and
I'm mad I didn't get the chance to thank you for being my mom and my dad
So mom, please accept this as a tribute I wrote this on the jet, I guess
I had to get this off my chest, I hope I get the chance to lay it 'fore I'm dead
The stewardess said to fasten my seatbelt, I guess we're crashing
So if I'm not dreaming, I hope you get this message
That I'll always love you from afar cause you're my ma

I guess, we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

I want a new life (Start over)
One without a cause (Clean slate)
So I'm coming home tonight
Well, no matter what the cost
And if the plane goes down
Or if the crew can't wake me up
Well, just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Oh, even if there's songs to sing
My children will carry me
Just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Because I put my faith in my little girls
So I never say goodbye cruel world
Just know that I'm alright
I am not afraid to die

I guess, we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far[Intro: Announcer from Soul Calibur]
Welcome back, to the stage of history

(Yo.. Slim Shady!)

Yo.. I'll fuckin.. I'll.. I'll puke, eat it, and freak you
Battle? I'm too weeded to speak to
The only key that I see to defeat you
Would be for me to remove these two Adidas and beat you
And force feed you 'em both, and on each feet is a cleat shoe
I'll lift you off your feet so fast with a roundhouse
You'll think I pulled the fucking ground out from underneath you
(Bitch!) I ain't no fucking G, I'm a cannibal
I ain't tryin to shoot you
I'm tryin to chop you into pieces and eat you
Wrap you in rope and plastic, stab you with broken glass
And have you with open gashes strapped to a soakin mattress
Coke and acid, black magic, cloaks and daggers
Fuck the planet, 'til it spins on a broken axis
I'm so bananas I'm showin up to your open casket
To fill it full of explosive gasses and close it back
With a lit match in it while I sit back and just hope it catches
Blow you to fragments, laugh, roll you and smoke the ashes

I see the light at the end but every time I take a step
It gets dim, tell me is this hell we're livin in?
If so, heaven's got to be better
But if we're hellbound, whatever, let's go down

Am I the worst? Because I, never go to church
I run a red light then sideswipe a hearse
I'mma drink till my liver rot, see the doc
Leave the E.R., then hit a bar for a liquor shot, fuck the liver spot
One day we all gon' die
But when I die, I'mma be so high
That I'mma get up and walk, leaving the concrete bare
With the chalk outline still there
I smoke 'til I choke and I sex a lot
I got a cross on my chain but it's just to rock
Now if I pray every night
Do I still have to hold my trey very tight?
You feel me God? I done did so much shit while on Earth
I smoke, I drink, I curse, and to make matters worse
I bust my gun first, and then I chat with your corpse
Since way back, I was one to never like back-talk
See me at the pearly gates in line, wearing a North Face
Nickle nine at my waist, God done lost faith
Angels greet me but I don't reply back
Just show me to my quarters, and oh yeah, where's Thai at?


Maxi was seriously wounded but the soul still burns
Final battle, fight!

Analyze the strength of my game, like Lee Corso
Call me a lost soul, with a vest on my torso
And of course, yo, y'all know I'm no stranger to danger
Like Christ in a manger, feel a whole range of my anger
I breathe down shit so hard you can see sound
And beat down these rap clowns in like three rounds
My pen 'bout as sharp as a dagger, walk with a swagger
Tie your wife to the back of a black Jag and I drag her
Ten blocks, untie the bitch and I still bag her
Give her a smack in the ass and a six pack of lager
My shit go as deep and as dark as a train tunnel
My flows spill like using the wrong end of a funnel
Everyday I grow more older, and more colder
Fly you to Colorado, roll you over with a Boulder
I know you want to retaliate but you won't dare
Cause you fucking with some niggas like this who just don't care


Time's up!
You lose![Verse 1: Eminem]
I want you, to understand something
That when I come up in this bitch I want the fans jumping
I want the fists, pumping in the air, I don't look like a millionaire
But I feel like a million bucks, ladies won't ya fill your cups
Shady's come to fill ya up, are you a D or a C cup?
You could even be a B, it's just me and D-R-E
You'll be in the E.R., we are strapped with so much TNT
We may blow, no not even CPR from the EMT's
Could help you to resuscitate, you busters must be flustered, wait
You can't cut the mustard, what's your problem, can't you bust a grape?
What's my name? Shady came and just crushed the game
It's really not even fair to them, cause they pale in comparison
So much they might as well wear his skin
Don't you wish you could just share his pen?
Cause this shit's getting embarrassing
The fog is thick and the air is thin
Cause he won't even let them try to breathe, la-didi-da-da-da-didi
He makes it look so easy, girl you just hit the lottery

Now this'll be the part of the song
That they drop the needle on and hell, breaks, loose
Try to restrain us you can't contain us
We're still gonna make a stink, no matter what, we, do
Everywhere we go it seems
We're looking for any excuse to just, cut, loose
So this'll be the part of the song
That they drop the needle on and hell, breaks, loose

This is when shit hits the fan, like it just splattered on Stan
This is the only moment that matters, your homie rolling with Mathers
Like chaos erupts, Em's in back, Dre's in the front
So do what we say at once, this song’s like a seance, it haunts
(It makes them stay in a trance, no choice, they have to dance)
It's like the playoffs, just making sure that we stay in the hunt
Take a day off for what? Man, you better lay off the blunts
You must be smoking something you think I ain't smoking nothing
Stay off my nuts, now hit the flo' baby, time to wipe away all the rust
Shake all them cobwebs loose, loosen up with a little bit of Grey Goose
Yeah girl shake that caboose, I don't wanna see you try to make no excuse
D-R-E is on the loose, a mongoose when it comes to the chronic use
You know I can't stand to lose, me and my goons are like animals
We come through like a pack of wolves, and we came here to retract the roof
Yeah man ain't that the truth, girl, your man's back in the booth
Definitely back up in this bitch, and this is when all hell breaks loose


Now I know you're feeling discouraged but homie just mark my words
I'm mur-dur-ing the flow, liquid courage, I'm fin' to blow
As soon as we hit the do' power surges head to toe
I'm sure to push it as far as words are meant to go
We're in the indigo Winnebago with tinted windows
Ferocious as we proceed to beat up the block wit your ho
With speakers knocking it's 3 o'clock, me and Doc
Then proceed to drop "E" and hop out the vehicle and knock on your do'

Yeah, so let us in 'fore we huff and puff and we blow
We ain't bluffing for nothing, we'll knock the stuffing out you
Revenge is so sweet, move 'til you injure your feet
Yeah, move it or lose it freak, move to the beat, lose yourself indubitably
Pass up on that little cute chick right there that'll be pretty damn stupid of me
Born and raised in the C-P-T, yeah Los Angeles, rules of the streets
Them haters hating on me, but I refuse to lose any sleep
Keep that deuce-deuce in the seat, "Dre fell off"? That's news to me

Hello... Allow me to introduce myself
My name is, Shady; it's so nice to meet you
It's been a long time... Sorry I've been away so long
My name is, Shady... I never meant to leave you

You see that chick in the gym, checkin' me out?
Any second I'm bout to stick her neck in my mouth
I lose a pill, and I'm recklessly wreckin' the house
That was supposed to be breakfast, where the heck is it now
There's the necklace I lost, right next to Stephanie's blouse
Man I should check to see if my mom left any out
Nope, guess I'll re-route
Maybe somewhere in the depths of the couch
Oh, jackpot, yeah, open sesame mouth
Down the hatch, and the feelin' you can't match it
I rat-tat-tap on your door with the damn ratchet
Att-ack-tack-tacking a whore with the damn hatchet
A napsack pack with like 40-some Xanaxes
Shorty come back, I'm tryna score me some lap dances
I'm bout to relapse, so baby pour me some Jack Daniel's
Forumula 44D and 40's with bad capsules
The bad apple spoils the bunch, I'm back atcha

Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say hello
And are you menstruating baby, my lil' friend's waiting to say hello
The way your titties are wiggling and your booties shakin' like Jello
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say hello

Yeah
My equilibrium's off, must be the lithium
I don't need to buy any drugs, man people gimme 'em
It just becomes everyday, extra curriculum
No reason in particular, it was strictly fun
A 5th of rum and 2 bottles of 151
51 people asleep in my damn living room
Excuse me hun, but what is your name, Vivian?
I woke up next to ya naked and err, did we um
Of course we did, but didn't I strap a jimmy, hun?
I'm looking for the torn wrapper, but there don't seem to be one
No offense baby girl, I don't mean any harm
But disease is something I'm trying to keep my penis free from
I find the package and I'm cool, I immediately run
Like Speedy Gonzales, see if I see anyone
Who might have a couple of 3's I'm fiending for some
My head is pounding to the beat of the drum

Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say hello
And do you happen to have anything on you to make my mood mellow?
Some are opal and some are pink, some are blue and some are just yellow
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say hello

Oh, those were the days, they certainly were
It's hurtin' me to know that I'll be closin' that curtain for good
(Word, word, word, word, word, word, word)
I second that and a third, rushed to emergency surgery
To try to flush me because of the drugs that he purchased
He's no longer getting them free, 100 bucks for these Percodans
Plus it's getting to be where he lustfully searched the den
Pain is hitting his knee and his muscles be hurting him
Tirelessly on the phone trying to russle up, muscle relaxants
For his back, and a couple of Pax's, now he's doubling backwards
And he's stumbling back, slipped and fell, hit his back bone
Heard something go crack, Now he's up in the bathroom
Like he's busting a nap, almost ended it that soon
Because of the fact, I'm just busting my own chops
While I'm busting a rap, resuscitated and rejuved, so fuck it I'm back


Hello... Allow me to introduce myself
My name is, Shady; it's so nice to meet you
It's been a long time... Sorry I've been away so long
My name is, Shady... I never meant to leave you[Intro: Dr. Dre]
Check check, one two, one two, one two
(Yo it’s rolling?) Yeah yeah yeah, Dr. Dre up in here, y'all know what this is
It’s what you’ve been waiting for, Funkmaster Flex big caps
Def Jam Records giving it to you baby
Yo Eminem, show these motherfuckers what time it is baby

I used to be a lonely man, only mad, until I got a million dollars, shit
Now if I only had some fucking hair I'd pull it, faster than a bullet
Out of 2Pac's chest before the ambulance came too late to do it
I'm trying to grow it back again, it was an accident
I had my back against the fan and chopped it off in Amsterdam
I hate the straight jacket it ain’t latching, and can't lock it
So they stapled my hand to my pants pockets
The cell's padded and battered like someone else had it
Before me and just kept throwing they fucking self at it
My head is aching! I'm dedicated to medication
But this med is taking too long to bring me this sedadation? (Come on!)
Anyway I got down with Dre (What up?)
The first man who taught me how the Glock sounded to spray
Running up and down the street screaming "Fuck the Police!"
When you still had your mother's fucking Nipple stuck in your teeth (You fucking baby)
Became a role model after Colorado
Now all they do is follow me around and holla Bravo!
Hell yea I punch my bitch and beat my kids in public
Suck my dick bitch!
I'm sick enough to fuck a man in his face but I won't
Cause you'll probably wanna stand in his place
So put a sock in it with your fake-ass 2Pac image
You faggots ain't tough you just get drunk and become talkative (Wanna Fight?)
I'm probably the awkwardest alcoholic talking
Walking like a midget with a ladder in his back pocket
So when you see me on your block stumbling, mumbling
A bunch of dumb shit like my drunk uncle does
I ain't buzzed! I'm just high on life
So why on earth would I need drugs, when I can fly on kites Motherfucker? Slim Shady

(Dr. Dre)
I'm drunk pass the tec
Cause if I get locked up tonight
Then I might not come home tonight!
(Keep it moving)
(Off and on, Eminem is on)
(Off and on, Dr. Dre is on)
Cause if I get locked up tonight
Then I might not come home tonight
(Keep it moving)
(Off and on, Eminem is on)
(Off and on, Dr. Dre is on)


The whole entire world can sit and twirl like a whirling tire
I set a fucking girl on fire with a curling iron (AHH!)
Psych I'm just joking, for christ sake
Don’t get so bent out of shape
Cause I went out and raped six girlfriends
Some people just don't get it, but I won't let it upset me
Cause they don't know better
They don't know what the fuck it's like to be so fed up
And fed so many uppers you're down and won't get up
My mind's got a mind of it's own, sometimes I can't find it at home
It hides in the stove (Hello, where you at?)
Shit, talk about your brain being baked
My shit's still in the oven on 480 degrees
Hailey Jade, daddy loves you baby
Don't ever tell me how to raise my daughter! Fuck you lady!
You critics wanna criticize but couldn't visualize
Individuals lives through a criminal's eyes
The neighborhood that I grew up in you could die for nothing
And Dirty Dozen watches over me so try some dumb shit
I'll have a fucking man raped with a band-aid over his mouth
And shove his head in the fan blade
Don't ever tell me what I can or what I can't say
Or change cause of the age-range in my fan base
Like I give a fuck who's buying this shit
Quit fucking buying it, I'm tired bitch, I'm dying to quit
Hip-Hop is universal now, it's all commercial now
It's like a circle full of circus clowns up in the circuit now
But now the White kids like it, so they tell me I can buy it
But as soon as I get on the mic it's like the night gets silent
Either that or booed, that’s why I keep an attitude
And go to sleep with it and wake up with it every afternoon
I'm sick of being judged, fuck it let me see a judge
I'll confess to every murder I committed since 3 years old


Fuck that, turn that shit off
Let's get the fuck out of here
You know how we doDr. Dre (Intro):
Check, check 1, 2, 1, 2 1, 2, it's rolling

Let's get the fuck out of here
You know how we do[Intro]
"Life," by Marshall Mathers
What is life?
Life is like a big obstacle put in front of your optical to slow you down
And every time you think you've gotten past it, it's gonna come back around
And tackle you to the damn ground
What are friends?
Friends are people that you think are your friends
But they're really your enemies, with secret identities and disguises
To hide their true colors
So just when you think you're close enough to be brothers
They wanna come back and cut your throat when you ain't looking
What is money?
Money is what makes a man act funny
Money is the root of all evil
Money'll make them same friends come back around
Swearing that they was always down
What is life?
I'm tired of life

I'm tired of backstabbing ass snakes with friendly grins
I'm tired of committing so many sins
Tired of always giving in when this bottle of Henny wins
Tired of never having any ends
Tired of having skinny friends hooked on crack and Mini Thins
I'm tired of this DJ playing your shit when he spins
Tired of not having a deal
Tired of having to deal with the bullshit without grabbing the steel
Tired of drowning in my sorrow
Tired of having to borrow a dollar for gas to start my Monte Carlo
I'm tired of motherfuckers spraying shit and darting off
I'm tired of jobs starting off at $5.50 an hour
Then this boss wonders why I'm smarting off
I'm tired of being fired every time I fart and cough
Tired of having to work as a gas station clerk
For this jerk breathing down my neck, driving me berserk
I'm tired of using plastic silverware
Tired of working at Builder's Square
Tired of not being a millionaire

But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics
If I had a magic wand, I'd make the world suck my dick
Without a condom on, while I'm on the john
If I had a million bucks
It wouldn't be enough, because I'd still be out
Robbing armored trucks
If I had one wish
I would ask for a big enough ass
For the whole world to kiss

I'm tired of being white trash, broke and always poor
Tired of taking pop bottles back to the party store
I'm tired of not having a phone
Tired of not having a home to have one in if I did have one on
Tired of not driving a BM
Tired of not working at GM, tired of wanting to be him
Tired of not sleeping without a Tylenol PM
Tired of not performing in a packed coliseum
Tired of not being on tour
Tired of fucking the same blonde whore after work
In the back of a Contour
I'm tired of faking knots with a stack of ones
Having a lack of funds and resorting back to guns
Tired of being stared at
Tired of wearing the same damn Nike Air hat
Tired of stepping in clubs wearing the same pair of Lugz
Tired of people saying they're tired of hearing me rap about drugs
Tired of other rappers who ain't bringing half the skill as me
Saying they wasn't feeling me on "Nobody's As Ill As Me"
And I'm tired of radio stations telling fibs
Tired of JLB saying, "where hip-hop lives"

But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics
If I had a magic wand, I'd make the world suck my dick
Without a condom on, while I'm on the john
If I had a million bucks
It wouldn't be enough, because I'd still be out
Robbing armored trucks
If I had one wish
I would ask for a big enough ass
For the whole world to kiss

You know what I'm saying?
I'm tired of all of this bullshit
Telling me to be positive
How am I 'posed to be positive when I don't see shit positive?
You know what I'm saying?
I rap about shit around me, shit I see
You know what I'm saying? Right now, I'm tired of everything
Tired of all this player-hating that's going on in my own city
Can't get no airplay, you know what I'm saying?
But hey, it's cool though, you know what I'm saying?
I'm just fed up, that's my word[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, I get it
I run this rap shit, now guess who's back
You thought I left you, now why would I do that? (1, 2, 3)

They keep on sayin' the same rappers are the best
Jay-Z and Kanye West, maybe they're just tryna distract it
From the fact that I'm comin' back
Or maybe it's cause I ain't black, maybe it's because of that
Maybe it's because I'm the highest sellin' artist in rap
While I'm sittin' back in my office jackin' off to my plaques
I'm still sick, how can I be sick this long
And I'm still alive, Magic Johnson arise
I thrive on makin' my opponents think that I've died
That's when I just pop up outta nowhere, oh yeah, there we go there
Damn I forgot how much money he got
On the beach of St. Tropez, but your man don't lay
In the sun cause I don't tan, I burn, blood clot
When you gonna learn how much money we've earned
How does it feel to know I came in this game at 25
And coulda retired at 29 in my 20's still
And Fif' here to lick on that Coca-Cola shit
And he ain't even gotta look at coke to even hold a brick
No more, oh boy, goddamn did he score
To go from sellin' bags to bottles right out the store
And Shady hit the box office man, he knocked the socks off us
My ex-wife is set for life, you profitless cocksuckers
So stay the fuck off us, we make pay
I'm just a super easy modest MC, okay?
Til I hear the word has been, that's when I start spazzin'
Smart asses, kiss a smarter ass then
I'm the best thing that ever happened to rap, bastards
I'm a blonde Dre, now gimme Kanye's glasses![Intro]
Another motherfucking exclusive!

I kissed a boy
And I liked it
The taste of his hairy fat dick

(Hahahaha, that's the remix)
Shade 45

I kissed a boy
And I liked it
The taste of his hairy fat dick

(Ken Kaniff Voice)
Peace!
I am the man
But I'm not the one with the can in his hand
I'm down with a different kind of street band
And I appear from place to place as the Music Man aka Masta Ace[Future]
Well Jimmy moved in with his mother
Cuz he ain't got no place to go

And now I'm right back in the gutter
With a garbage bag that's full of clothes

Cuz you live at home in a trailer
What the hell you gonna do?

Cuz I live at home in a trailer
Mom I'm coming home to you

Well my names Jimmy, and his name's Greg Buel
And me him and you went to the same school
This ain't cool, I'm in a rage, he tapping my mom
We're almost the same age!
On the microphone I drop bombs
Look at this car, thanks a lot mom!
"Here happy birthday Rabbit
Here's a brand new car, you can have it"
A 1928 delta, this shit won't even get me to the shelter!
And I can't even say I'm from Motown
Cause I'm back in the 8-1-0 now

Cuz I live at home in a trailer
Mom I'm coming home to youI need Christopher Reeves to come and lay his verse
I think he can spit it better on Medicine Ball
First off, I did not even realize the guy died
So I guess them Christopher Reeves jokes ain't gonna fly
Whoa, I'm on a roll, don't get me started
Ellen got pissed at me tried to push me and pussy farted
With such accuracy he aims and he shoots the target
Cupid's arrow and Portia ??? now look, sweetheart it's
The kissin' bandit on a mission to leave, Miss Degeneres
Disenchanted by men now just listen damn it
Miss De Rossi, I need no posse, now single-Hand-ed-ly
Will steal your heart with a kiss
Where should I plant it? Mm-wha! Baby, it's *moi*
And my repertoire's runnin' around in pink panties and leopard bra
And negligar, negligee, you say tomayto I say TOMato
I’m Tommy Mottola Mariah don`t stop me I`m on a roll, ohh
Y'all know what it is[Hook]
That's why they call me Slim Shady
(I'm back)
I'm back
(I'm back)
I'm back
(Slim Shady)

I murder a rhyme one word at a time
You never heard of a mind as perverted as mine
You better, get rid of that nine, it ain't gonna help
What good's it gonna do against a man that strangles himself
I'm waiting for hell, like hell, shit I'm anxious as hell
Manson, you're safe in that cell, be thankful it's jail
I used to be my mommy's little angel at twelve
Thirteen I was putting shells in a gauge on a shelf
I used to, get punked and bullied on my block
Til I cut a kitten's head off and stuck it in this kid's mailbox
I used to give a - fuck, now I could give a fuck less
What do I think of suc-cess
It sucks, too much press I'm stressed
Too much cess, depressed, too upset
It's just too much mess, I guess I must just blew up quick (yes)
Grew up quick (no) was raised right
Whatever you say is wrong, whatever I say is right
You think of my name now whenever you say, "Hi"
Became a commodity because I'm W-H-I-
-T-E, cause MTV was so friendly to me
Can't wait 'til Kim sees me
Now is it worth it, look at my life, how is it perfect
Read my lips bitch, what my mouth isn't working
You hear this finger, oh it's upside down
Here, let me turn this motherfucker up right now


I take each individual degenerate's head and reach into it
Just to see if he's influenced by me, if he listens to music
And if he feeds into this shit he's an innocent victim
And becomes a puppet on the string of my tennis shoe
{*vocal scratches*} My name is Slim Shady
I been crazy way before radio didn't play me
The sensational {*vocal scratch "Back is the incredible!"*}
With Ken Kaniff, who just finds the men edible
It's Ken Kaniff on the internet
Tryin' to, lure your kids with him into bed
It's a sick world we live in these days
"Slim for pete's sakes put down Christopher Reeve's legs"
Geez, you guys are so sensitive
"Slim it's a touchy subject, try and just don't mention it"
Mind with no sense in it, fried schizophrenic
Whose eyes get so squinted, I'm blind from smokin 'em
With my windows tinted, with nine limos rented
Doin lines of coke in 'em, with a bunch of guys hopping out
All high and indo scented
And that's where I get my name from, that's why they call me


I take seven [kids] from [Columbine], stand 'em all in line
Add an AK-47, a revolver, a nine
A MAC-11 and it oughta solve the problem of mine
And that's a whole school of bullies shot up all at one time
Cause (I'mmmm) Shady, they call me as crazy
As the world was over this whole Y2K thing
And by the way, N'Sync why do they sing
Am I the only one who realizes they stink
Should I dye my hair pink and care what y'all think
Lip sync and buy a bigger size of earrings
It's why I tend to block out when I hear things
Cause all these fans screaming is making my ears ring (AHHH)
So I just, throw up a middle finger and let it linger
Longer than the rumor that I was sticking it to Christina
Cause if I ever stuck it to any singer in showbiz
It'd be Jennifer Lopez and Puffy you know this
I'm sorry Puff but I don't give a fuck if this chick was my own mother
I'd still fuck her with no rubber and cum inside her
And have a son and a new brother at the same time
And just say that it ain't mine, what's my name


Guess who's b-back, back
Gue-gue-guess who's back (hi mom)
{*scratch*} Guess who's back

Slim Shady, 2001
I'm blew out from this [blunt], [fuck][Intro: Eminem & Obie Trice]
Kay Slay! (Yeah) Yo..
Drama King! (Yeah!)
Check it out, check it out, O. Trice!
(Shady Records nigga, it's going down once again, boy)
It's just a scratch, man (Let's go, Em)

I Murder this Inc as soon as I touch the page
You ain't gon' have no other choice but to rush the stage
And charge the mic, and I hope you got the heart to fight
Cause you gon' have to, cause you ain't got the smarts to write
Something that good, to try to come back at me with
What you gon' do, try to out-rap me with that happy shit?
You motherfuckers crack me up, talking bout you gonna smack me up
Yall won't even back me up
Throw up your paws, you pussies can't even scratch me hard
It's like fucking cats de-clawed trying to jack me off
You think I'm afraid? What you trying to throw some fear in me?
You think I'm dumb enough to roll with no security?
I'm doing my best to try to show maturity
But don't sit there and stare at me like hoes and sneer at me
Like it's supposed to be scaring me
Like I won't leap clean over this fucking
V.I.P. rope and throw this chair
At anyone close or near me, trying to approach me physically
Cause he don't spit lyrically
And he knows that my flow's so sick, his ho's on my dick
And he's so sick of hearing me, my posters are staring at him
But I don't think he knows the severity
Of what it could escalate to or that it could grow so seriously
If I go hysterically, cause I guarantee
There's no one in here that would resort back childhood
Any quicker than I would, or hit you with plywood
Especially when I'm sipping on this liquor and tonic
One swig of this bottle I'mma go upside your head so hard with it
The mark from it'll be so dark that it'll leave a scar so big
You'll be able to read a label from the motherfucking
Sticker that's on it, I'm sick of the nonsense
Shit is ridiculous and I refuse to let it get to this point
Where I'mma let you sit on my conscience, I'm gone, bitch (YEAH!)

I'm gone bitch
Shady Records motherfucker, we gone, bitch
I said we gone bitch, so long, bitch
Catch up if you can, we moving on, bitch

Now who you know been to Kyoto, Tokyo
Off of one debut, screaming, "I'm in Janai yo!"?
Obie Trice, showed you right
He done seen overseas, he's not a prototype (nah)
Nobody's protégé, Em only showed O. the way
Fuck what the media say
If you listen to music then you should know that O. Trice fused it
In a matter where he speaks how the streets views it
Choose, to translate it through the art of music
And started using it reaching the youth
Influenced by the truth in it (truth!)
And as a boy, a man, I ran from boys in vans
Do the knowledge, acknowledge and try to comprehend
Hand full of contraband
A product of my environment, narcotics and violence
Inspires the content, but my intent is
To retire these tired-ass writers in si-lence (yeah!)
Cause haters they hate us cause Shady became famous
And claimed the rap game when they thought he'd be nameless (hah!)
But racist accusations won't change us
Let the truth be told, you think O. will be over here
Like, "Master, show them you got soul!"
No, anybody knows us knows that's not how we roll
So, I still push the bucket
If I ain't trust it I wouldn't fuck with it
But fuck it, I'm gone bitch![Narrator]
Torture chambers, secret passageways, vats of acid, and deadly vaults

I said, ohh
Damn, it feels good to be back
I'm having a Relapse

How the hell did he manage to get more felony charges?
He's already got life in jail man, what the hell is his problem?
Well to be honest, the smell of these chronic leaves make me hella demonic
They've compelled me to kill this elderly man
And I get these panic attacks, pop a Xanax, relax
Trying to stick my fucking dick inside a mannequin's ass
Then I get manic depressed, see the orthodontist, get gassed
Man, it's kick ass, the first thing I put on is the mask
Speaking of masks, man, it ain't too late to have a change of pace
And take it off and show my face, so you can see the things you face
And slice you up and cook you after you're murdered by strangulation
That's bacon souffle you making, ain't you? Well, thank you, Jason
There goes one more coma, due to blunt force trauma
Just give me one more Soma and I'll be done for mama
Go in the damn broom closet, another Valium, lost it
Shoving the vacuum nozzle, down the bathroom faucet
It seems like everyday I get a little flakier
The medication is making my hands a little shakier
Hand me that eighteen-month-old baby to shake him up
It'll only take me a second to choke his trachea
Breaking his neck in eighty-some places baby, here Shady comes, lady
He's got the razor b-blades and the ch-ch-chainsa-saw, baby
You b-b-blundering, bumbling, m-m-mumbling dum-dums
Yeah, here I come-come, you hear the rumbling vrumm-vrumm?
There's something inside of that blue tub and that drum, drum
A head and torso of someone, where'd it come from?
Who's it belong to? Maybe the girl with the long, blonde
Hair who disappeared and left her cheerleader pom-poms
Clearly there's somethin' wrong, cause she didn't come home
She's missing, where is she? Something fishy is going on
I guess he stuck the bitch with the pitchfork with the long prongs
Now everybody get your dance on to my damn song, come on[Verse 1: Eminem]
My music is soothing but it's also been proven
That it can put you in the mood to jump out your car while it's moving
You been waiting on this moment, my sermon is like a omen
I'm serving, I'm Erick Sermon, I saw the window was open and I jumped through it
My shit if you don't get pumped to it
I quit, here's my rhyme book, go ahead and thumb through it
And pick what you want from it, rummage and find something
You can use to jump someone and roll up bumping
I'm constantly copping over you, squatting, shit has gotten
To the point where I ain't even writing no more, I'm just jotting
This is chicken scratch, shit is sickening, I've been kicking ass
Off bullshit throwaway rhymes, pick a batch
I live for the love of rap, you crazy
I've made beats for Jay-Z for free
Page me, you need a beat, you Canibus?
Then it's Dre's fee, if you Kay Slay, the fees waved
I stay beefing with JD, 'til the day Dre 2-ways me
That it's okay to stop blazing him
Oops! I put it out, I apologize now
It's too late G, it's on tape and the tape leaked
Say What You Say, motherfucka
Drama King, Kay Slay, motherfucka
We dictate these mixtapes motherfucka
Xzibit, blaze this little gay midget cocksucker[Produced by Bass Brothers]

Who came through with two Glocks to terrorize your borough? (huh?)
Told you how to slap dips and murder your girl? (I did!)
Gave you all the finger and told you to sit and twirl
Sold a billion tapes and still screamed, "Fuck the world!"
(Slim Shady...) so come and kill me while my name's hot
And shoot me twenty-five times in the same spot (Ow!)
I think I got a generation brainwashed
To pop pills and smoke pot til they brains rot (uhh-oh)
Stop they blood flow until they veins clot
I need a pain shot, and a shot of plain scotch
Purple haze and acid raindrops
Spike the punch at the party and drink pop (gulp gulp)
Shaved my armpits and wore a tank top
Bad Boy, I told you that I can't stop
You gotta make em fear you 'fore you make em feel you
So everybody buy my shit or I'mma come and kill you

I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need, some good weed to set you free
You know me, I'm your friend, when you need a Mini Thin
(I'm Slim Shady...) I'm Shady!

I like happy things, I'm really calm and peaceful (uh-huh huh)
I like birds, bees, I like people
I like funny things that make me happy and gleeful (hehehe)
Like when my teacher sucked my wee-wee in preschool (Woo!)
The ill type, I stab myself with a steel spike
While I blow my brain out, just to see what it feels like
Cause this is how I am in real life (mm-hmm)
I don't want to just die a normal death, I wanna be killed twice (uh-huh)
How you gonna scare somebody with a gun threat
When they high off of drugs they haven't even done yet (Huh?)
So bring the money by tonight - cause your wife
Said this the biggest knife she ever saw in her life (Help me! Help me!)
I try to keep it positive and play it cool
Shoot up the playground and tell the kids to stay in school (Stay in school!)
Cause I'm the one they can relate to and look up to better
Tonight I think I'll write my biggest fan a fuck you letter


Yo.. I listen to your demo tape and act like I don't like it
(Aww that shit is wack!)
Six months later you hear your lyrics on my shit
(What?? That's my shit!)
People don't buy shit no more they just dub it
That's why I'm still broke and had the number one club hit (Yup, uh huh)
But they love it when you make your business public
So fuck it, I've got herpes while we on the subject (uh-huh)
And if I told you I had AIDS y'all would play it
Cause you stupid motherfuckers think I'm playin when I say it
Well, I do take pills, don't do speed
Don't do crack (uh-uhh) don't do coke, I do smoke weed (uh-huh)
Don't do smack, I do do shrooms, do drink beer (yup)
I just wanna make a few things clear
My baby mama's not dead (uh-uhh) she's still alive and bitchin (yup)
And I don't have herpes, my dick's just itchin'
It's not syphilis, and as for being AIDS infested
I don't know yet, I'm too scared to get tested


And that's my name![Produced by Bass Brothers]

Ah yeah (It's like this, like this)
This is Eminem, baby
Back up in that motherfucking ass ('Til forever, 'til forever)
One time for your motherfucking mind (For MCs, MCs)
We represent the 313, you know what I’m saying?
Its good they don’t know shit about this, for the ‘96

Ayo, my pen and paper cause a chain reaction
To get your brain relaxin', the zany actin' maniac in action
A brainiac in fact son, you mainly lack attraction
You look insanely wack when just a fraction of my tracks run
My rhymin' skills got you climbin' hills
I travel through your mind and chill your spine like siren drills
I'm slimin' grills of roaches, with spray that disinfects 'em
Twisting necks of rappers 'til their spinal column disconnects
Put this in decks and check the monologue, turn your system up
Twist them up, and indulge in the marijuana smog
This is the season for noise pollution, contamination
Examination of more car tunes than animation
My lamination of narration
Hits a snare and bass on a track for duck rapper interrogation
When I declare invasion, there ain't no time to be staring gazing
I turn the stage into a barren wasteland

I'm Infinite, you heard of hell? Well I was sent from it
I went to it serving a sentence for murdering instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it but when I hear the beat
I'm tempted to make another attempt at it, I'm Infinite

Bust it
I let the beat commence so I can beat the sense in your elite defense
I got some meat to mince, a crew to stomp and then two feet to rinse
I greet the gents and ladies, I spoil loyal fans
I foil plans and leave fluids leakin' like oil pans
My coiled hands around this microphone are lethal
One thought in my cerebral is deeper than a jeep full of people
MCs are feeble, I came to cause some pandemonium
Battle a band of phony MCs and stand the lonely one
Imitator intimidator, stimulator, simulator of data, eliminator
There's never been a greater since the burial of Jesus
Fuck around and catch all the venereal diseases
My thesis will smash a stereo to pieces
My a capella releases classic masterpieces through telekinesis
It eases you mentally, gently, sentimentally, instrumentally
With entity, dementedly meant to be infinite

I'm Infinite, you heard of hell? Well I was sent from it
I went to it serving a sentence for murdering instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it but when I hear the beat
I'm tempted to make another attempt at it, I'm Infinite

Man I got evidence, I'm never dense and I've been clever ever since
My residence was hesitant to do some shit that represents the MO
So I'm assuming all responsibility
‘Cause there's a monster will in me that always wants to kill MCs
Mic nestler, slamming like a wrestler
Here to make a mess of a lyric smuggling embezzler
No one else is specialer, my skill is intergalactical
I get cynical, act a fool, then I send a crew back to school
I never packed a tool or acted cool, it wasn't practical
I'd rather let a tactical, tactful track tickle your fancy
In fact I can't see, or can't imagine
A man who ain't a lover of beats or a fan of scratching
So this is for my family, the kid who had a cameo
On my last jam plus the man who never had a plan B
Be all you can be, ‘cause once you make an instant hit
I'm tensed a bit and tempted when I see the sins my friends commit

I'm Infinite, you heard of hell? Well I was sent from it
I went to it serving a sentence for murdering instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it but when I hear the beat
I'm tempted to make another attempt at it, I'm Infinite

90 Spot, '96 ('96), and on and on and on (and on and on)Eminem- "Infinite" Front Cover






Eminem- "Infinite" Back Cover[Eminem]
I was born with a dick in my brain, yeah fucked in the head
My stepfather said that I sucked in the bed
'Til one night he snucked in and said
"We're goin out back, I want my dick sucked in the shed"
Can we just play with Teddy Ruxpin instead?
"After I fuck you in the butt, get some head
Bust a nut, get some rest"
The next day, my mother said
"I don't know what the fuck's UP with this kid!
The bastard won't even eat nothing, he's fed
He just hung himself in the bedroom, he's dead!"
"Debbie, don't let that fucker get you upset
Go in there, stick a fuckin cigarette to his neck
I bet you he's fakin it, I bet you
I bet he probably just wants to see how upset you would get
I'll go handle this, of course, unless you object"
"Aw, go fuck his brains out if any's left in his head"

If you count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I completely lost it
Is he nuts? -- NO, he's insane!

(Did you get him?) Naw, fucker tried to bite my face off
I just got fuckin chased off with a chainsaw
Then he took the chainsaw, bit the fuckin' blades off
Ate the blades, stuck the baseball in the slingshot
Then the aimed at his own face, let the thing pop
Took his eye out, picked it up and played ping-pong
Then he played ping-pong with his own ding-dong
That motherfucker's got nuts like King Kong
Then he set the lawnmower out on the dang lawn
And he laid all up underneath it with the thing on
Then he took his pants and took every fuckin' thing off
Everything 'cept his tanktop and his training bra
Ain't he raw? Yeah, maniac, that Shady dawg
Man, that motherfucker's gangsta, ain't he, dawg?
Shady dawg, what be goin through that fuckin brain of yours?
Say no more, what the fuck you waitin' for? Sing along


Don't you know what felch means? (Yeah!) Well, then tell me
Would you rather get felched or do the felching?
Fuck 'em in the ass, suck the cum out while you belchin' {*burps*}
Burp, belch, then go back for a second helping
Could you dig what I'm sayin, man? Could you smell me?
I want you to feel me like my stepfather felt me (uhmm...)
Fuck a little puppy, kick the puppy while he's yelpin
(Shady, what the fuck you saying?) I don't know - HELP ME!
What the fuck's happening?! I think I'm fucking MELLLTING!
"Marshall, I just love you boy, I care about your well-being"
NO, dad! I said NO! I don't need no help peeing
I'm a big boy, I can do it by myself, see?
I only get naked when the babysitter tells me
She showed me her a movie like "Nightmare on Elm Street"
But it was X, and they called it "Pubic Hair on Chelsea"
"Well, this is called 'Ass Rape' and we're shooting the jail scene"

"What do you want from me??"

"Remember me?"

"I killed you!"

"Thought I was dead, didn't you?"

"What do you want from me?!"

"I'm alive!"

"Oh, God!"

"Get up!"

"No"

"Get up and look in the mirror!"

"I don't want to!"

"Look in the mirror to see your reflection..."

"LEAVE ME ALONE!!"

"LOOK IN THE MIRROR! YOU'RE NOTHING! YOU'RE NOTHING WITHOUT ME!

While I see what the FUCK y'all do[Intro]
Your mother.. you fuckin' faggot
Ayo, this next song is dedicated to the memory of Erik Shrody
Rest in peace, we ain't forget about you, you fuckin' homo, we still remember

There once was a man who liked to jump around
But he got too old to jump up and down
So he put the mic down and picked the guitar up
Started singin the blues like there was no tomorrow
Left his boys in the House of Pain
It was the wisest decision he ever made
But the dumbest thing he could ever do
Was try to buck a .380 on those that act shady
Tell me now what you gonna do

Cause I remember all those years, how it was when you were here
I remember how it was, how it was when you were young
Yesterday was so long ago, Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit came along now
Don't nobody wanna hear your old ass sing no more

I remember back when you had the Knack
And I remember when you had your first heart attack
I was right there laughin when I heard the news
I just wish the cardiac woulda murdered you
Maybe Ice-T's right, you are a bitch
You come around when you're broke and you leave when you're rich
But the dumbest thing you could ever do
Was try to buck a 380 on those who act shady
Tell me now what you gonna do


Remember back in '94, like right before Ms. Everlast was Whitey Ford
Before his heart attack had him on life support
When House of Pain was outta fame like someone doused the flame
And they became destined to never jump around again
Or even further back, when I first had heard "The Knack"
And you were down with Syndicate, I went to get your shit, man I was into it
But then you went and took your style and switched the shit
Now you sound ridiculous, you dickless piece of shit
How could you diss me, bitch?
I liked you, thought you was alright for a white dude
Remember Sway and Tech when I came up and sat beside you
Started rhymin, then you left the room and didn't say goodbye or nothin'?
Like you mad that someone else was white and tried to rhyme or somethin
I'm sorry man, I wasn't tryin to steal your light or nothin
But you're a homosexual, white rappin Irish (Muslim)
Man I wish I was Irish, I could be a *Muslim* too
Then I'd be confused as you, and I wouldn't know what to do
What's up with you? I never fucked with you, why would you fuck with me?
Knowin' I could rap circles around you, what, are you as nuts as me?
Plus I can sing better than you and I don't fuckin' sing
And probably play guitar better, and I ain't never touched a string
But I ain't mad at you, I'd hate me too if I was you
I'm what you used to be, shit you was me in '92
So everytime I write a lyric, I'mma think of you
And maybe that will help me know what it's like to sing the blues


You fuckin' punk pussy, you fuckin faggot, sissy fuck
And by the way, a .380's a fuckin' sissy gun
If you're gonna shoot somebody use a fuckin' real gun, you little bitch
Next time say my fuckin' name in a song, don't be subliminal about it
You wanna fuckin' diss me, diss me you fuckin' faggot
You fuckin' punk pussy, you fuckin' little bitch, fuckin' cuntYa mother...fuckin' faggot

Hey yo...this next song is dedicated to the memory of Erik Schrody
Rest in peace
We'll never forget about you...fuckin homo

Thanks it's been real
I love you but I just can't deal
With the stress this game is giving me...
But before I go
You know
I can't close the show
Without no closure
So before I leave...

Yeah
I just want to take the time out
To basically say
Rest In Peace
To Deshaun Holton
That's my heart man
Dr. Dre
For giving me the opportunity
Just to even listen to me
To get me to this point
I wanna thank Jimmy Iovine
Interscope, Aftermath
Everybody in the whole Shady staff
Everybody whose basically supported me from day one
Paul Rosenburg, Tracy McNew
You know I love you guys
I couldn't do it all without you
D12
Ca$his, your gonna be a beast when you get out there man
Trust me homie, my ears don't lie to me
Who else am I forgetting
Oh yeah, Obie Trice
Bobby Creekwater, and basically man
The whole city of Detroit
8 mile road for making what I am today
Which basically goes back to Proof and D12
I love you guys man
Runyon Ave for holding me down when shit got thick
Oh, it wouldn't be complete, If I didn't
Thank my mom, bitch
So


It's a broke day, but everything is okay
I'm up all night, but everything is alright
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep
It's a long year pretending I belong here

One day I plan to be a family man, happily married
I wanna grow to be so old that I have to be carried
Til I'm glad to be buried and leave this crazy world
And have at least a half a million for my baby girl
It may be early to be planning this stuff
Cause I'm still struggling hard to be the man and it's tough
Cause man, it's been rough, but still I manage enough
I've been taken advantage of, damaged and scuffed, my hands have been cuffed
But I don't panic and huff, frantic and puff
Or plan to give up, the minute shit hits the fan, it erupts
I'm anteing up, double or nothing, I've been troubled enough
And I'm sick of struggling and suffering, see
My destiny's to rest at ease, 'til I'm impressed and pleased
With my progress, I won't settle for less than cheese
I'm on a quest to seize all, my own label to call
Way before my baby is able to crawl
I'm too stable to fall, the pressure motivates
To know I hold the weight of boulders on my shoulder blades
I see the golden gates to heaven on Earth
Where they don't pull a weapon on you when you're stepping on turf, Kyu


I'm going for broke, gambling and playing for keeps
Every day in the streets, scrambling and paying for cheep
Praying for sleep, dreaming with a waterin' mouth
Wishing for a better life for my daughter and spouse
In this slaughterin' house, caught up in bouts with the root of all evil
I've seen it turn beautiful people crude and deceitful
And make them do shit illegal for these Grants and Jacksons
These transactions explain a man's actions
But in the mist of this insanity, I found my Christianity
Through God and there's a wish he granted me
He showed me how to cope with the stress
And hope for the best instead of mope and depressed
Always groping a mess of flying over the nest
To selling dope with the rest, I quit smoking cess to open my chest
Life is stressful inside this cesspool
Trying to wrestle, I almost bust a blood vessel
My little brother's trying to learn his mathematics
He's asthmatic, running home from school away from crack addicts
Kids attract static, children with automatics
Taking target practice on teens for Starter jackets
I'm using smarter tactics to overcome this slum
I won't become as dumb as some and succumb to scum
It's cumbersome, I'm trying to do well on this Earth
But it's been Hell on this Earth since I fell on this Earth

I was born with a set of horns
And metaphors attached to my dang umbilical cord
Warlord of rap that'll bash you with a 2 by 4 board
And smash into your Honda Accord with a four door Ford
But I'm more toward droppin' an acapella
To chop a fella to Mozzarella worse than a helicopter propeller
Got you locked in a cellar
With your skeleton showing
Developing anorexia while I'm standing next to ya
Eating a full course meal watching you starve to death
With an IV in your vein feeding you liquid Darvocet
Pumping you full of drugs
Pull the plugs on the gunshot victims full of bullet slugs
Who were picked up in an ambulance and driven
To Receiving with the asses ripped out of they pants
And given a less than 20 percent chance of living
Have a possible placement as a hospital patient
Storing the dead bodies in Grandma's little basement
Doctor Kevorkian has arrived
To perform an autopsy on you while you scream "I'M STILL ALIVE!"
Driving a rusty scalpel in through the top of your scalp
And pulling your Adam's apple out through your mouth
Better call the fire department
I've hired an arson to set fire to carpet
And burn up your entire apartment[Hook: Sample]
Jealous! (8X)

Jealous!?! What he mean jealous, know what I'm saying?
He just mad cause he all with them ugly hoes, know what I'm saying?
Girls don't buy him no clothes. He bought that ho some clothes!!
He don't buy me no clothes. That nigga ain't got no money, no vibe, no dick
I mean, what do I got to be jealous fo'?
He ain't gonna make it nowhere. He ain't got no type of time
He has no career move, I mean...

I come home every single day from working double shifts
And stop along the way to pick you up a couple gifts
I come inside and you pretend you miss me when you kiss me
Then you diss me and we strenuously fight continuously
Again you frisk me, for numbers trying to bust me
It must be only just because you never learned to trust me
Plus we only squabble over only irrelevant issues
Too many tissues, for my feelings you misuse
I buy you jewelry, you make a fool of me
I bring you diamond rings you say I'm bad at timing things
So what's a man to do when all I hand to you is handed back to me
You act to be this gangsta bitch, that ain't what first attracted me
I used to love your company, now you’re always pumpin' me
For information and you tell your friends you plan on dumping me
So I'mma wait for your evacuation
Cause every accusation makes me wanna smack your face in
See I've never been so sure, and you're just insecure
So my solution to your jealousy presents a cure
I recommend you take your things and check them in
Look at the nervous wreck I'm in, I need my second wind, Say What?


Fuck you and what you going through
Fuck Eminem, he just mad cause I left that nigga for another man
Me and Eminem don't need nothing but minus money
Immature, me? Nigga ain't got no dick, no swang in his thang
Know what I'm saying? He just mad cause I'm getting it all night
Jealous of me, know what I'm saying? That's what I'm talking about
Motherfucker just trying to get his pussy

I used to be a puppet and a sucker for your silent treatments
I used to be intoxicated with your sweet scents
Until the day I started following your feetprints
And tapping in your phone conversations through the heat vents
It made complete sense, there's someone else you like
So I confronted you and asked you who was Mike?
And you was like, (I want a new nigga)
Someone rich that I could follow
And you'll be over me by the time you see tomorrow
Leaving me in sorrow, Brandy never felt so brokenhearted
I fell apart when you departed then the joking started
I was an open target, you play comedian
And I became the laughing stock. but now I'm on my feet again
And so we meet again, your acting like an ex-wife
All in my sex life, I got a message from Phife
He goes, "You didn't want me to see yo hon, don't want me now
Take the towel, wipe your brow," quit trying to hunt me down
You run me down and now your trying to apologize
For all the lies and everytime you made me ball my eyes
Because I got a bigger wallet size, you wanna swing it
Jealousy is in the house ya'll, Fellas sing it...

Maaaaan!
Let's go
Hey yo Fif'
Yeah?
Call 'em and tell 'em
It's time to hate us again
We're back
Haha

Jimmy can crack corn but I don't care
My enemies crack corn but I don't care
You can be black white or albino yeah
You can have cornrows inside your hair

This bottle of wine goes upside your head
A little bit psycho but I know that
Think you just don't say it and I won't say it
See if you don't brag then I don't brag
I know I'm bad as long as I know I'm bad

Little bit like the boy who cried wolf did
See me but don't dare to try no shit

The rattlesnakes right there to bite your ass
And I can be so quite and strike so fast
Like lightening bolts right out the sky go blast
From out of nowhere you might find your career

If you keep coming back that only means you know you lost the fight
They wanna talk shit let them talk shit cuz they talk shit
Knowing deep down they really just wanna squash it
Cuz no one wants to walk around steppining dog shit
And get doo doo on their shoe again as soon as they wash it
But the pride won't let em inside they like go get em
And I'm just like why you trying to fight momentum
We just keep winning by landslides oh an um

Listen kid where I'm from the wolves smell fear
They'll strip your ass of your jewels right here
Man I'm gonna say this one time and get this clear
Man you can catch a hot one like out of no where
Beautiful day without drama is rare
Your girl's a freak man sometimes we share
Yeah I wear a condom and you go bear
You probably heard about me I'm a shown up player
In the hood politicin' like I'm running for mayor
Running, winding, donning and shining you know what I'm saying

And get to clappin' 'em
And like, back and forth, because
This is what you thought it wasn't
It be's the brothers representin' the Dirty Dozen
I be the F-R-O the double G
And check out my man
He goes by the name of um, er

Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady
I'm an M-80, you little like that Kim lady
I'm buzzin', Dirty Dozen
Dirty rotten rhymer
Cursin' at you playas' worse than Marty Schottenheimer
You wacker than the motherfucker you bit your style from
You ain't gon' sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it, fuck it, while we coming out in the open
I'm doing acid, crack, smack, coke and smoking dope then
My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic (Hi, Marshall!)
I have a disease, and they don't know what to call it
Better hide your wallet
Cause I'm coming up quick to strip your cash
Bought a ticket to your concert just to come and whip your ass
Bitch, I'm coming out swinging, so fast it'll make your eyes spin
You getting knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson
The proof is in the pudding, just ask DeShaun Holton
I'll slit your motherfucking throat worse than Ron Goldman

So when you see me on your block with two Glocks
Screaming, "Fuck the world" like 2Pac
I just don't give a fuck
Talking that shit behind my back
Dirty macking, telling your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuck
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuck
But see me on the street and duck
Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
Cause I just don't give a fuck

I'm Nicer than Pete, but I'm on a Serch to crush a Miilkbone
I'm Everlast-ing, I melt Vanilla Ice like silicone
I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
I'm colder than snow season when it's 20 below freezin'
Flavor with no seasonin'
This is the sneak preview
I'll diss your magazine and still won't get a weak review
I'll make your freak leave you
Smell the Folgers crystals
This is lyrical combat, gentlemen; hold your pistols
But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
Slim Shady. Eminem was the old initials (bye bye!)
Extortion, snortin', supportin' abortion
Pathological liar, blowin' shit out of proportion
The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic
Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict
Half animal, half man
Dumping your dead body inside of a fucking trash can
With more holes than an afghan


Somebody let me out this limousine, I'm a caged demon
On stage screamin' like Rage Against the Machine
I'm convinced I'm a fiend, shootin' up while this record is spinnin'
Clinically brain dead, I don't need a second opinion
Fuck droppin the jewel, I'm flipping the sacred treasure
I'll bite your motherfuckin style, just to make it fresher
I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches
Sick of naggin bosses bitchin while I'm washin dishes
In school I never said much
Too busy having a headrush
Doing too much rush had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed
Went to gym in 8th grade, fucked the women's swim team
Don't take me for a joke, I'm no comedian
Too many mental problems got me snortin coke and smokin weed again
I'm going up over the curb, drivin on the median
Finally made it home, but I don't got the key to get in


Shit, fuck everybody
Outsidaz, Pacewon, Young Zee
(Fuck the entire world) DU[Intro]
Guess who's back, back again
Shady's back, tell a friend

Now everyone report to the dance floor
To the dance floor, to the dance floor
Now everyone report to the dance floor
Alright stop, pajama time

Come here little kiddies on my lap
Guess who's back with a brand new rap
And I don't mean rap as in a new case
Of child molestation accusations
Ah ah ah ah ah, no worries
Papa's got a brand new bag of toys
What else could I possibly do to make noise?
I've done touched on everything but little boys
That's not a stab at Michael
That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho
I go a little bit crazy sometimes
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
Good god, dip, do a little slide
Bend down, touch your toes, and just glide
To the center of the dance floor
Like TP for my bung-hole
And it's cool if you let one go
Nobody's gonna know, who'd hear it?
Give a little "poot poot," it's ok
(fart sound) Oops my CD just skipped
And everyone just heard you let one rip

Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance
Yeah boy, shake that ass
Whoops I mean girl, girl girl girl
Girl you know you're my world
Alright now lose it (ah ah ah ah ah)
Just lose it (ah ah ah ah ah)
Go crazy (ah ah ah ah ah)
Oh baby (ah ah) oh baby, baby (ah ah)

It's Friday and it's my day
Just to party all the way to Sunday
Maybe 'til Monday
I don't know what day
Everyday's just a holiday
Cruisin' on the freeway, feelin' kind of breezy
Let the top down and my hair blow
I don't know where I'm goin'
All I know is when I get there someone's gonna (touch my body)
Excuse me miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk
But I'm feelin' just a little stressed out from work
Would you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair
Spit on me, maybe gouge my eyes out (yeah)
Now what's ya name girl, what's ya sign?
(Man you must be up out yo mind)
Dre (ah ah) beer goggles, blind
I'm just tryin' to unwind (now I'm)


It's Tuesday and I'm locked up
I'm in jail and I don't know what happened
They say I was runnin' butt naked
Down the street screamin' (ah ah ah ah)
Well I'm sorry, I don't remember
All I know is this much, I'm not guilty
They said "Save it, boy we got you on tape
Yellin' at an old lady" (touch my body)
Now this is the part where the rap breaks down
It gets real intense, no one makes a sound
Everything looks like it's "8 Mile" now
The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves
Now snap back to reality, look! there's B. Rabbit
"Oh you signed me up to battle? I'm a grown man!"
Tubba tubba tubba tubba tubba tubba tubba
I don't have any lines to go right here so, chubby
Tellytubby fellas (what) fellas (what)
Grab your left nut, make your right one jealous (what)
Black girls, white girls, skinny girls, fat girls
Tall girls, small girls, I'm calling all girls
Everyone report to the dance floor
It's your chance for a little romance or butt squeezin'
It's the season, just go (ah ah ah ah)
It's so appeasin'

You've been patiently waiting

To make it through all the hate

Debating whether or not

You can even weather the storm

As you lay on the table

They operating to save you

It's like an Angel came to you

They think they're crazy but they ain't crazy lets face it, shit basically
They just playin sick, they ain't shit They ain't sayin shit.. spray'em Fifty
A to the K, get in the way I'll bring Dre and them wit me
And turn this day into fuckin mayhem you stayin wit me?
Dont let me lose you, Im not tryin to confuse you
When I let loose with this uzi and just shoot through your Izuzu
You get the message am I gettin through to you?
You know whatz comin you motherfuckerz dont even know do you?
Take some Big and some Pac and you mix them up in a pot
Sprinkle a little Big L on top, what the fuck do you got?
You got the realest and illest killaz tied up in a knot
The Jugganautz of this rap shit like it or not
Its like a fight to the top just to see who died for the spot
You put your life in this - nothin like survivin the shot
Y'all know what time it iz az soon az Fifty signz on this dot
Shit what you know about death threats, cuz I get alot
Shady Records was eighty seconds away from the towers
Some cowards fucked with the wrong building they meant to hit ours
Better evacuate all children (50 Cent: woo)- nuclear shower
Theres nothin spookier, you're now about to witness the power of




It's like a throne that he dont even own
He won't sit down, given the crown he just throws it around
It's like a joke he's like a king, but he dont rule a thing
He dont want the diamonds, want the gold or want the jewelry
He dont want the fame dont want the lute he's in this for a sport
Runnin circles with the competition on the court
He appreciates your support but he ain't beggin for it
And you can't love it you can hate it but you can't ignore it
You can't be that ignorant but you can try to sell him short
But you can't fuck with his last joint or the one before it
And he was gonna raise hell like them country boys
And if I'm frontin then you better come confront me for it

This Is The Story Of A Warrior I Kno U Kno It
Tru Warrior Go Ahead Make Some Noise
It ain't healthy To Be Makin Niggas Paranoid
Hit Your Corner With my weapon I Dont Need My Boyz
Im Doin 120 On The Fast Lane
Kick Back Just Relax Let Me Do My Thang
Dont Give a Fuck About You Suckas Gotta Maintain
Money Power And Respect In This Rap Game



Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsta's
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely cause don't anyone know me
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate, I guess words are a
Mothafucka they can be great
Or they can degrade, or even worse they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass
But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get they hands on every dime you have, they want you to lose your mind
Every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me, strictly just to get me off
Of these streets quickly
But all they kids be listenin' to me religiously, so i'm signin' cd's while
Police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter but his grudge is against me
If i'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense Pete
It's all political, if my music is literal, and i'm a criminal how the fuck
Can I raise a little girl
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to, you're full of shit too, Guerrera, that
Was a fist that hit you...* this song was a free download on his official website

Are we supposed to shut up or talk...I'll cut your butt up and walk
Around with my ass showing all over the fuckin town

....Then you get done up in chalk
Yo

We ready...we ready .. we ready.. we ready ?
Ready to hold it steady....Speakin of hold it steady
You can hold my nuts steady and then
I can stick my dick in you like a machette...If you're a girl
If you're a girl then you're my world...And I will kill anybody
That means... you, her or him
It doesnt matter cause I'm Eminem
And I'm Slim...I'm also slim and your future's Whim

Ha ha....don't stop
D-12 y'all...yea we bust it off the top
We get in that ass Preparation-H style
Knock more boots than that group H-Town (Booo!)
Everybody tryina tell us to wait now
You look dumb as fuck...Like Puffy in his video on that breakdown (hahaha)
Tryin to dance around
How the fuck it feel lock in hand set now
Sever your style .. Divide and Parish
Part ish...when my cart is bustin thru this
Wassup to Bizarre Kid
Targets get hit and liftoff
Here it is we bout to rip off
Lick shots...no time...we gettin dick snot
Emzy

Speakin of lift off
I'm blastin off...your ass is soft...so I'm startin to jack off
Cuz I'm so horny...and your lyrics are so corny
That they bore me and I woke up too late this morning
Or too early...wait a minute there goes Shirley
The girly I fucked last year when her hair was curly
Couldn't remember it cuz I was Infinite
And I met Ken Kaniff in Connecticut
He said his predicates and pronouns and wanted to throw down
And he said “I like you”...and then he walked up and said “Let me snake bite you”
And I said hell no...kicked him with my shell toe
Gave him a elbow...Ayo Proof ...go

Yo it's the D to the 1 - 2
What you wanna get done to
Your chest plate...eradicate
Get your flesh ate...easily done..Here it is
Freestyle...no need to write shit...cuz when we write shit
Y'all like to buy shit...that why street light up when we write stuff
It's time to be the champions at this...it's D-12
1-2 True crew...Slim Shady and Big Proof
Knockin over igloos in Alaska when we blast ya
A massacre creator, one time for data
Darker than Vader...go anybody hot as the Equator
It's time to get down one time for those that dont know us
Girls wanna blow us like Monica....Lewinsky
Come against me

Go and see I'm an invincible MC
If you dont believe it then you wanna try to convince me
That you're doper than me...which we'll hope
You would hope to be....but hopefully I will rock globaly
And nationwide...thats why my ass is wide
Thats why your ass just died on the passenger side
Like a fuckin ride...when it got shot up by a drive-by
When I drove by 5 times and gave it five tries
And still missed it
I got a fuckin' mental illness a gentle stillness
Violence...complete silence is what I need in the room while I freestyle
What I need is to do...what is need is smoke weed and brew
And......smoke brew ? You don't smoke brew
If you do I'll choke you and then I guarantee I'll out smoke you
You're crew's a joke too and I can stick my dick in a bitch and poke you

Stick it in there....rock with my cock on sky rock
Knock ya eye out the sock...(sock)
Get..(get) yeah we come to rock....(it)
So don't get in the way cuz we gon drop....(shit)
Now how you feel right now we bust yo..op....(tic)....(tock)
We lunatics with mics and we dont stop we come to rock
The dirty dozen is non-stop
To the top from tree tops to ewoks that pop Reeboks
And men with pre-ops
Yo now there is 3-Pac's
Master P....Thug Life and now it's 2pac
Get back to that one...here goes the rhyme that you dropped

The rhyme that I dropped is stickin up IHOP
In high tops and walking around like a one-eyed Cyclops
And you can't see me....I only got one eye and I can still see you
You can even give it a dumb try...If you're a dumb guy then come try this
But I rock the microphone with my flyness
So get off my jock..get of my cock..when I sky rock ...it in sky
Rock..shit...bitch

Ayo...a lot of people always try to tell us...that we gonna be better or failures
But me or Slim yo you can't tell me
You try to freestyle son we gon' put these verses on your LP
Slow down with that old stuff....I heard the most of y'all is Mos Def

My LP...my whole LP...tha last one was screaming help me
You couldn't melt me if you was Vanilla Ice...Yo guess what
My Nuuuuuuuuutz!!
Here I go with the lyrical miracle...spiritual spirital...you dont wanna hear it though
I rickety rock the microphone
Don't do it dont do it cuz that shit is stupid...I knew it
I take a beat and loop it...I take a beat and troop it
What the fuck did that mean...I dont know but I got phat jeans on
And I already said that but I dont know where my head's at
All I wanna do is go back to the hotel and know where my bed's at

Yo wheres the beds at so we can relax and catch Ease
Y'all dont want none of tha dirty Deez
From the 3-1 its for the three of thirds
One third MC yo we smoke y'all like herbs
Under the curb early morn take it to born
Y'all get broke up...put back together ...re-enactment
Some times you see this...you just a faggot
No need to tag it...wit more loot that Jimmy Swagart

Faggot....uh oh...was that homophobic...?
But no one knows it...and I'm so homophobic
I won't even throw clothes in the closet
Fuck it...I've lost it....I'm holocausted...see my face it's written all
Acrossed it
This beer makes me wanna disappear this year
I'm so high I'm 'bout to die...and I'm so tired I'm 'bout to fry
You're so fired you're down

Hey....it's me...it's the hamster man
Coming all the way from Amsterdam
And I come to tell you all a little secret
So you can ........eat it ....you got to grab your crackers
{mumbling}

Quit spittin your writ shit bitch I'll kill you and kick you
In your motherfuckin' dick and your clit...you little pussy
Hermaphrodite with no appetite
And you ain't rappin' right but you was taking rapid bites
Of my dick when you was on it...my brain is haunted
I walk up in a place in a T-shirt wit my stains on it
But I dont give a damn...give a fuck...give a shit...give a hell
Give a piss give a dick give a lick

Yea....live and direct it's us
You better back up

You better back up before I jack off
Back off before I jack off

You better back off before he jack off (laughing)
You better back off before I jack off

Colder than Jack Frost...smack you across your face
While I'm still jackin off
Sittin' in the closet beatin' my shit
Ain't got nuttin' else to do cuz I'm thinkin' of a bitch
Wait a minute ...oh shit she's here
Look who walked in the door....come in it's Britney Spears!!!!
(Ken Kaniff)
Oh....come here little girl
Come here little girl

What happened? (I dunno)
We stopped rappin' (Oh it's clappin')
Gun clappin' ...and all I need is one napkin to wipe the cum off
When I come off with the drum off
Whatever the hell that meant...but I can still speak wit' a accent
A French accent
Excuse my French but
Suck my dick touche le le poo...uhh....bitch

Bonjour...I'm here with the cure...Oh yea lets rock it for the drawer
Hey Em...how you doin this is me...The Em jock...get off my
Damn cock

Yo while you're spraying verbs...you ain't even fuckin' saying words
(THuuuG) Pronounce your words right...and you can ride around curbs
And bounce your herbs tight
What the fuck ? (Yo somethin' is in the beat that keeps talkin')
Yo put another beat on before you get peed on

Yo are we done or what? They want us to freestyle for 45 min—

Hi...Hi.... My name is ...my name is...my name is
Slim Shady...Slim Shady...Bitch you're little just like that Kim lady
And I'm in sky rock radio...the shadiest bro on the radio
But you dont hear me though[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'm keepin' it raw, illegal like Malik and Jamal
Cause I don't believe in the law, like I'm Steven Seagal
Flippin' off the police while I'm leapin' a wall
Take some Tylenol, then fall asleep in a mall
I got ya little son, you'll be receivin' a call
You lucky this little punks still breathin' at all
Fuck the world, this how I get even at y'all
Pop shit, get rolled up and leave in a ball
I hit you in your mouth and sink ya teeth in ya jaws
You won't be able to eat shit, not even a malt
This lethal assault, is givin' you a reason to stall
I'm cockin' this deuce deuce and I'm squeezin' it off
At the first burp, fart sniffle a sneeze and a cough
Get your arm chewed off like you was teasin' a dog
I'm cold enough and hot enough to freeze and unthaw
I'll kick my girl out, in 10 degrees in her bra
You faggots turn yellow like the trees in the fall
I'm shittin' on rappers, (Where's Shady?) he's in the stall
All that's left of your niece is a piece of her doll
And all that's left of her puppy is a leash and a paw[Ken Kaniff] I'm gonna call this motherfucker. Oh fuck yeah. Give him a piece of my mind. A piece of my ass
Uhh yeah, uhh suck it
Oh fuck yeah, oh Shaggy
Uhh, this is why they call you '2 Dope', ain't it?
Uhh, fuck yeah
Uhh, take it out, take it out
Uhh, now give something to Jay
Uhh, Violent Jay
Don't bite it, don't be violent with it
Ow, just suck it, nice and slow, yeah
Uhh, uhh, fuck yeah
You got.. uhh, now give it back to Shaggy
He was sucking it better
Uhh, now say my name. (Eminem)
Say my name. (Eminem)
What? Oh, fuck you guys!
Give me my dick back!
Fuck you guys!
If you want Eminem, you can have Eminem!
Fuck you guys (Ken?), Imma leaving! (No)
(Ken wait! .. Nice going, Shaggy!)[Produced by Dr. Dre & Mel-Man]

When I was just a little baby boy
My momma used to tell me these crazy things
She used to tell me my daddy was an evil man
She used to tell me he hated me
But then I got a little bit older
And I realized, she was the crazy one
But there was nothing I could do or say to try to change it
Cause that's just the way she was

They said I can't rap about being broke no more
They ain't say I can't rap about coke no more
Slut, you think I won't choke no whore
Til the vocal cords don't work in her throat no more?
These mothafuckas are thinking I'm playing
Thinking I'm saying the shit cause I'm thinking it just to be saying it
Put your hands down, bitch, I ain't gon' shoot you
I'ma pull you to this bullet and put it through you
Shut up, slut, you're causing too much chaos
Just bend over and take it like a slut, okay, Ma?
"Oh, now he's raping his own mother
Abusing a whore, snorting coke
And we gave him the Rolling Stone cover?"
You're goddamn right bitch, and now it's too late
I'm triple platinum and tragedies happened in two states
I invented violence, you vile venomous volatile bitches
Vain Vicodin, vrin vrin vrin!
Texas Chainsaw, left his brains all
Dangling from his neck, while his head barely hangs on
Blood, guts, guns, cuts, knives, lives, wives, nuns, sluts
Bitch, I'mma kill you

You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls neither, you ain't nothing but a slut to me
Bitch, I'mma kill you, you ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gonna never stop beefing, I don't squash the beef
You better kill me, I'mma be another rapper dead
For popping off at the mouth with shit I shouldn't have said
But when they kill me, I'm bringing the world with me
Bitches too, you ain't nothing but a girl to me

I said you don't wanna fuck with Shady (cause why?)
Cause Shady will fucking kill you (ha ha)
I said you don't wanna fuck with Shady (why?)
Cause Shady will fucking kill you (cause why?)


Bitch, I'mma kill you
Like a murder weapon, I'mma conceal you
In a closet with mildew, sheets, pillows and film you
Fuck with me, I been through hell, shut the hell up
I'm tryna develop these pictures of the Devil to sell 'em
I ain't "acid rap," but I rap on acid
Got a new blow-up doll and just had a strap-on added
Whoops! Is that a subliminal hint? No
Just criminal intent to sodomize women again
Eminem offend? No, Eminem'll insult
And if you ever give in to him you give him an impulse
To do it again then if he does it again
You'll probably end up jumping out of something up on the tenth
Bitch, I'mma kill you, I ain't done, this ain't the chorus
I ain't even drug you in the woods yet to paint the forest
A bloodstain is orange after you wash it 3 or 4 times in a tub
But that's normal, ain't it, Norman?
Serial killer hiding murder material
In a cereal box on top of your stereo
Here we go again, we're out of our medicine
Out of our minds and we want in yours, let us in or I'mma kill you


Know why I say these things?
Cause lady's screams keep creeping in Shady's dreams
And the way things seem, I shouldn't have to pay these shrinks
These 80 G's a week to say the same things tweece
Twice, whatever, I hate these things
Fuck shots, I hope the weed'll outweigh these drinks
Motherfuckers want me to come on their radio shows
Just to argue with 'em cause their ratings stink
Fuck that! I'll choke radio announcer to bouncer
From fat bitch to all 70,000 pounds of her
From principal to the student body and counselor
From in-school to before school to outta school
I don't even believe in breathin'
I'm leaving air in your lungs
Just to hear you keep screaming for me to seep it
OK, I'm ready to go play, I got the machete from O.J
I'm ready to make everyone's throats ache
You faggots keep egging me on
'Til I have you at knifepoint, then you beg me to stop
Shut up, give me your hands and feet
I said shut up when I'm talkin' to you, you hear me, answer me
Or I'mma kill you


Ha ha, I'm just playing, ladies
You know I love you[Intro]
Aww, look at daddy's baby girl
That's daddy's baby, little sleepy head
Yesterday I changed your diaper, wiped you and powdered you
How did you get so big? Can't believe it, now you're two
Baby you're so precious, daddy's so proud of you
Sit down bitch! You move again I'll beat the shit out of you! (Okay)

Don't make me wake this baby! She don't need to see what I'm bout to do!
Quit crying, bitch! Why do you always make me shout at you?!
How could you just leave me and love him out the blue?!
Oh, what's the matter Kim, am I too loud for you?!
Too bad, bitch! You're gonna finally hear me out this time!
At first, I'm like: "Aight, you wanna throw me out; that's fine!"
But not for him to take my place! Are you out your mind?!
This couch, this TV, this whole house is mine!
How could you let him sleep in our bed?! Look it, Kim!
Look at your husband now! (No!) I said, look at him!
He ain't so hot now, is he, little punk?!
(Why are you doing this?!) Shut the fuck up!
(You're drunk! You're never gonna get away with this!)
You think I give a fuck?! Come on! We're going for a ride, bitch! (No!)
Sit up front! (We can't just leave Hailie alone! What if she wakes up?)
We'll be right back; well, I will: you'll be in the trunk!

So long, bitch you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on, living in this world without you

You really fucked me Kim! You really did a number on me!
Never knew me cheatin' on you would come back to haunt me
But we was kids then, Kim! I was only eighteen
That was years ago! I thought we wiped the slate clean
That's fucked up! (I love you!) Oh God, my brain is racing
(I love you!) What are you doing? Change the station!
I hate this song! Does this look like a big joke? (No!)
There's a [four] year-old little [boy] laying dead with a slit throat
In your living room! Ha-ha! What, you think I'm kidding you?!
You loved him didn't you? (No!)
Bullshit, you bitch! Don't fucking lie to me!
What the fuck's this guy's problem on the side of me?
Fuck you asshole! Yeah, bite me!
Kim, Kim! Why don't you like me? You think I'm ugly, don't you?
(It's not that!) No, you think I'm ugly (Baby)
Get the fuck away from me! Don't touch me!
I hate you! I hate you! I swear to God, I hate you!
Oh my God, I love you! How the fuck could you do this to me?!
(I'm sorry!) How the fuck could you do this to me?!

So long, bitch you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on, living in this world without you

Come on, get out! (I can't! I'm scared!)
I said get out, bitch! (Let go of my hair!)
(Please don't do this, baby! Please! I love you!)
(Look, we can just take Hailie and leave!)
Fuck you! You did this to us! You did it! it's your fault!
Oh my God, I'm cracking up, get a grip Marshall!
Hey, remember the time we went to Brian's party
And you were, like, so drunk that you threw up all over Archie?
That was funny, wasn't it? (Yes) That was funny, wasn't it?! (Yes!)
See, it all makes sense, doesn't it?
You and your husband have a fight
One of you tries to grab a knife, and during the struggle
He accidentally gets his Adam's apple sliced! (No!)
And while this is going on, his son just woke up and he walks in
She panics and he gets his throat cut! (Oh my God!)
So now they both dead, and you slash your own throat
So now it's double homicide and suicide with no note!
I should've known better when you started to act weird
We coulda...hey, where you going? Get back here!
You can't run from me Kim! It's just us, nobody else!
You're only making this harder on yourself!
Ha-ha, got ya! Go ahead, yell!
Here, I'll scream with you! "Ah, somebody help!"
Don't you get it bitch? No one can hear you!
Now shut the fuck up and get what's coming to you!
You were supposed to love me!!
Now bleed bitch, bleed!! Bleed bitch, bleed!! Bleed!!

So long, bitch you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on, living in this world without you[Produced By: The New Royales]

Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
Kings never die

I can hear the drummer drumming
And the trumpets, someone's tryna summon someone, I know somethin's coming
But I'm runnin' from it to be standing at the summit
And plummet, how come it wasn't what I thought it was
Was it, too good to be true?
Have nothin', get it all but too much of it
Then lose it again, did I swallow hallucinogens
Cause if not, where the hell did it go?
Cause here I sit in Lucifer’s den by the dutch oven
Just choosing to sin
Even if it means I'm sellin' my soul, just to be the undisputed again
Do whatever I gotta do just to win
Cause I got this motherfuckin' cloud over my head
Crown around it, thorns on it
Cracks in it, bet you morons didn't think I'd be back, did ya?
How 'bout that, I’m somehow now back to the underdog
But no matter how loud that I bark, this sport is somethin' I never bow-out at
I complain about the game, I shout and I pout, it's a love-hate
But I found out that I can move a mountain of doubt
Even when you bitches are countin' me out, and I appear to be down for the count
Only time I ever been out and about
Is drivin' around town with my fuckin' whereabouts in a doubt
Cause I been lost tryna think of what I did to get here but I'm not a quitter
Gotta get up, give it all I got or give up
Spit on, shit on, stepped on, but kept goin'
I'm tryna be headstrong but it feels like I slept on my neck wrong
Cause you're moving onto the next, but is the respect gone?
Cause someone told me that
(Kings never die)

Don't give me that sob story liar, don't preach to the choir
You ain't never even had to reach in the fire to dig deep
Nobody ever handed me shit in life, not even a flyer
Wouldn't even take shit into consideration
Obliterate anyone in the way
I think I see why a lot of rappers get on these features and try to show out on a track with me
But it'd actually have to be a fuckin' blow-out to get me to re-tire
Tell these new artists that kings never die
I know shit has changed in this age, fuck a Twitter page
Did it just say I've been upstaged?
Why am I online? It's driving me crazy
I'm ridin' shotgun tryna get a gauge
On what's hot, but I'm not one to conform
But as days pass in this shit
And opinions sway, I can hear 'em say
If I stay passionate maybe I can stage a miraculous
Comeback as if I went away
But detractors just say so much for the Renegade
Someone's gonna make me blow my composure
Here I go again, center stage and I feel like I'm in a cage
They so want a champion to fall
It's no wonder why I laugh at 'em, cause why can't we win 'em all?
So fuck what these cynics say
(It) just goes ta show that when my back's against the wall
And I'm under a tack again, that I'll act as if I'm 'posed ta
With this pent up rage, cause all these plaques in my office
On the floor stacked against the door
Are they just metaphors for the odds of me comin' back again?
Cause all the accomplishments, accolades, awards
And trophies just don't mean jack anymore
If I'm here today and gone tomorrow
And I'm not gonna be

Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
Kings never die

I want it, I'm comin' to get it
So you son of a bitches don't duck you’re gonna get Riddick Bowe’d
Critics'll end up in critical, think your shit is dope all you're gonna get is smoked
And I ain't stopping 'til I'm on top again, all alone and on a throne
Like a token of respect, or a homage poem, or an ode I've been owed
Tossed in the air by my own arm, and launched so hard it broke my collarbone
And when it's my time to go, I'm still not leaving
Stop for no one, I don't know but I've been told an obstacle that
Blocks your road, knock it over, time to go for the pot of gold, cause

They say kings never die
Just ask Jam Master Jay
They just grow wings and they fly
So, hands up, reach for the sky
Try to hold on and prolong these moments
Cause in a blink of an eye
They'll be over

Tryna secure your legacy like Shakur
And ensure nobody's ever gonna be what you were
So before you're leavin' this Earth
You want people to feel the fury of a pure evil cerebral, berserk
Deacon of words, syllable genius at work
Plus I'm thinkin' that they're mistakin' my kindness for weakness, kill 'em with meanness
I went from powdered milk and Farina
To flippin' burgers on the grill for some peanuts
From Gilbert's to arenas, call me Gilbert Arenas, still appeal to the dreamers
I made it to the silverscreen but Rocky's still what the theme is
Khalil on the beat cause makin' the beat ain’t the same feelin' to me as killin' the beat is
Or fulfillin' to me is what fillin' a seat is
It's that "Sound Bombing" Thirstin' Howl
Common, underground, Diamond D, Outsidaz
Stomach growl, throbbin' hunger, out-rhymin' everyone
God just give me one shot, I swear that I won't let you down
I'mma be around forever-and-a-day, even in the ground
You ain't never ever gonna hear 'em say I ain't

Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
Kings never dieAny rapper sayin' those kind of rhymes
In this day and age, in this period of time Trying to battle Eminem
Is worse than David Starr Trying to battle Proof, Eye-Kyu, B-Flat, Bizarre ? that's why you beg to differ me
You ain't got no style plus you lack delivery
Not to brag, I don't mean to boast
Look, my face is pale, but you look like you seen a ghost
? You're that bitch, you couldn't slip up in the zone If I put banana peels around this fucking microphone
So get a bull dozer, start from bottom to top And take this building down cause that's the only way you're wrecking shop[Eminem]
Yo, yo, I start it off, yo, yo
My name is Shady, his name is Proof
Yo, we used to have a roof up on my house
And now we had a mouse that ate the cheese out of the fridge
Didn't want to admit that I was on welfare when I was three
Plus when I was four, my mother used to leave
She used to always slam the door and say
"Goodbye, goodbye Marshall, I'm leaving
I'm single and right now I'm going to mingle at bingo
"Yeah, see you later alligator" is what she said
And I would always stay at house freezing til I'm dead
Cause it was cold inside that house we never had no heat
Yo Proof used to come walking up right up the street and be like
"Yo what up Em? How you doing?"
I used be like "Yeah man it's good to see you dawg
But my life's ruined cause my mom just left"
She left my brother Nate and I hate the fact
We never had no food on our plate
So then Proof said "What up Em?"
Yo, so I said "Proof won't you come in?"

Yeah, yeah, come in what’s up with dat
Tango and Cash
Came to mingle and blast
Together tougher than Alcatraz prison bars
Driving foreign cars
Yes it's me and my man compadre
Black and white, white and ivory and black ebony
They can't step to me
Rubbery and heavenly
They can't see us in the 313 vicinity
Aiyyo Em, ha, ha, ha, ha

What up? Ha, ha, I'm coming like ha, ha
I'm ill like nah, nah
And y'all don't wanna see me because I'm ill with the skill
And I can grill and I always keep it real
When I built my garage back after it just got burnt down
Sorry that my parents weren't always around
But it was really hectic growing up
But now I'm blowing up so it don't matter
Every show I do I'm always showing up
To the club drunk as hell, drunk as fuck, drunk as what?
Can't say that on MTV
But remember it?, little, old, wimpy me
Who used to always dream be on MTV
Now you can't see me
I know you remember that rhyme
Ay, wait a minute, yo check it out, I'm about to flatline
Pass the mic back to Proof, cause we get loose
We drink gin and juice, sip it cause we always raise the roof

Aiyyo, aiyyo, we all up in your sight like cataracts
Me and Em tag team
Beat any of y'all on some battle rap
See us next time we stripping out your Cadillacs
How you like that? Soon you down like a battle axe

I'm down like a battle axe
I got a phatter axe to smash
And I smash your cataracts
Cause it'a a Cadillacs that I be driving
When I be high off fucking vivarin
Now you can't see me cause I'm reviving and surviving in the D
Every single day in Detroit
If rappers wanna step to me they better get to the point
Cause they don't understand the way that I do it
The fluid that I be spittin' is never written
Cause I'm always, always bitten, cause it...

Aiyyo, you make your neck crack like a snare pop
We're fresh and they're not
So give it up, don't even do this
You're wack, in fact you get flat-lined
You need practice
We stick you like a cactus
Nah you're not a guy you're an actress
The fact is...

Here's my address
This is my old address
And called: a street called Dresden
Yo, dead president is what I'm resurrecting
Gotta say "what's up?" to Desmond and J.L.B
But yo they don't help me do a thing, they never did
When I was a clever kid rhyming
I always used to go to school
And climb in the back baseball diamond

Hey yo, aboard, hold up
Hurt shoulder
Peace for Kurt Loder
Yeah, we're doing an interview
In a minute or two we're gonna enter in you

In the nude, when we intrude
Don't mean to be rude but yo what's up dude?
How you doing MTV? How you doing Kurt?
How you doing everybody else in the world?
You getting hurt by this freestyle that I be coming up with
Erupting and kicking your mother in the tummy and in the stomach

Aiyyo, aiyyo, and all of this we just done is freestyle
Ah, ah, ah, don't touch that dial
Yeah

Hold it right there I'm your worst nightmare
Wiping diapers on my high chair

What?! Yeah

When I was this big, now I'm still bigger
But I'm skinny like a twig
Skinny little white boy growing up I liked noise
I spike punch and light joints

Aiyyo, everybody looks for us to follow
We thrust the bottle, thrust the throttle
Bust a bottle over your head
Train your thoughts just like Cus d'Amato
Your guts is hollow
Back up, Proof and Em

And all them wack MC's steppin' to me at Saint Andrews
Just remember that I hate you and yo I can't stand you

Em & proof: Yeah! bye bye, goodbye good night, bye bye, good night, bye bye, good night, bye bye


“nine deuce”[Intro: Polina]
Tell me where to go, tell me what to do, I'll be right there for you
Tell me what to say, no matter if it's true, I'll say it all for you

I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is fallin'
Why am I so differently wired? Am I a martian?
What kind of twisted experiment am I involved in?
Cause I don't belong in this world
That's why I'm scoffin' at authority
Defiant often flyin' off at the handle at my mom, no dad
So I am noncompliant at home, at school, I'm just shy and awkward
And I don't need no goddamn psychologist
Trying to diagnose why I have all these underlying problems
Thinking he can try and solve 'em
I'm outside chalking up drawings on the sidewalk and in the front drive
Talking to myself, either that or inside hiding off in
The corner somewhere quiet, trying not to be noticed
Cause I'm crying and sobbin'
I had a bad day at school so I ain't talkin'
Some cocksucker shoved me into a fucking locker
Cause he said that I eye-balled him

And if you fall, I'll catch you there
I'll be your savior from all the wars
That are fought inside your world
Please have faith in my words

Cause this is my legacy, legacy, yeah
This is my legacy, legacy, yeah
There's no guarantee, it's not up to me, we can only see
This is my legacy, legacy, legacy, legacy

I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is fallin'
Why am I so differently wired in my noggin?
Cause sporadic as my thoughts come, it's mind-bogglin'
Cause I obsess on everything in my mind
Small shit bothers me, but not my father
He said sayonara then split but I don’t give a shit
I'm fine long as there's batteries in my Walkman
Nothing is the matter with me
Shit look on the bright side at least I ain't walkin'
I bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment
Complex on a ten-speed which I've acquired parts that
I find in the garbage, a frame then put tires on it
Headphones on, look straight ahead if kids try and start shit
But if this is all there is for me, life offers
Why bother even trying to put up a fight? It's nonsense
But I think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience
What about them rhymes I've been jottin'
They are kind of giving me confidence
Instead of trying to escape through my comics
Why don't I just blast a little something, like Onyx
To put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that
Say what I want to say to the kid that said that I eyeballed him
Grab hold of my balls like that's right, fight's on bitch
Who woulda knew from the moment I turned the mic on that
I could be iconic, in my conquest
That's word to Phife Dawg from a Tribe Called Quest

Cause this is my legacy, legacy, yeah
This is my legacy, legacy, yeah
There's no guarantee, it's not up to me, we can only see
This is my legacy, legacy, legacy, legacy

I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is fallin'
Now I think the fact that I'm differently wired's awesome
Cause if I wasn't, I wouldn't be able to work words like this
And connect lines like crosswords
And use my enemy's words as strength
To try and draw from, and get inspired off 'em
Cause all my life I was told and taught I am not shit
By you wack fucking giant sacks of lying dog shit
Now you shut up bitch, I am talkin' thought I was full of horseshit
And now you fucking worship the ground on which I am walkin'
Me against the world, so what? I'm Brian Dawkins
Versus the whole 0-16 Lions offense
So bring on the Giants, Falcons and Miami Dolphins
It's the body bag game, bitch, I'm supplyin' coffins
Cause you dicks butt kiss, bunch of Brian Baldingers
You're going to die a ball licker, I've been diabolical
With this dialogue since '99 Rawkus
You don't respect the legacy I leave behind y'all can suck a dick
The day you beat me, pigs'll fly out my ass
In a flying saucer full of Italian sausage
The most high exalting and I ain't haltin'
'til I die of exhaustion, inhale my exhaust fumes
The best part about me is I am not you
I'm me, I'm the Fire Marshall and this is my...

Cause this is my legacy, legacy, yeah
This is my legacy, legacy, yeah
There's no guarantee, it's not up to me, we can only see
This is my legacy, legacy, legacy, legacyDetroit

There is a resilience that rises from somewhere deep within your streets
You can't define it, but you can feel it
You can feel it overflowing from the people who call you home
From people who are always proud to declare, 'I'm from Detroit'
You took our country from it's infancy, into industry
And your name still carries with it the idea of a nation built on steel, muscle and sweat
You became the city that carried the country
The city, like the sport, is built on dreams
People who would drive to you, driven to excel
Who know nothing is accomplished without hardwork, without sacrifice
When you hurt, we hurt
Your streets witness our struggle
Your bricks are our rage through the emptiness of each house shuttered, of each factory closed
We've lived through the ups and the downs
But we remain, Detroit
We can never turn our backs on you Detroit, because we are you
My home
The home of Motown, Cadillac and Joe Louis
Through all this, we cannot be defeated, because we have never been defeated
You've built us, you've moved us, you've shaped us
Sometimes down, but never out
Take strength in us, your people

Stay up DetroitDear Afeni

Sorry if it looks a little sloppy, I could've done a little better if I had the right pencils. Instead, I had to draw it in pen. Plus, I just kind of thought of the idea a little too late. But I've been drawing since I was 10, and I thought you might like it. Anyways, thank you for always being so kind to me. You are a true Queen, and I mean that in every sense of the word. I will never forget the opportunities you have given me. You will always be in my heart, my thoughts, and my prayers. As I have said before, you have no idea how much your son and his music has inspired, not only the "Hip Hop" world, but, speaking for myself, has inspired my whole career. He was, and still is, the true definition of a "Soldier." When I was feeling at my worst; (before fame, before Dre) I knew I could put that "2Pac" tape in, and suddenly, things weren't so bad. He gave me the courage to stand up and say "F**k the world!" "This is who I am! And if you don't like it, go f**k yourself!" Thank you for giving us his spirit, and yours! God Bless you!

Love

Marshall[Bruno Mars]
This one's for you and me, living out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
With my arms out wide I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters
By the time you hear this I will have already spiralled up
I would never do nothing to let you cowards fuck my world up
If I was you, I would duck, or get struck like lightening
Fighters keep fighting, put your lighters up, point 'em skyward uh
Had a dream I was king, I woke up, still king...
This rap game's nipple is mine for the milking
Till nobody else even fucking feels me, till' it kills me
I swear to god I'll be the fucking illest in this music
There is or there ever will be, disagree?
Feel free, but from now on I'm refusing to ever give up
The only thing I ever gave up is using. No more excuses
Excuse me if my head is too big for this building
And pardon me if I'm a cocky prick but you cocks are slick
Poppin' shit on how you flipped ya life around, crock-of-shit
Who you dicks try to kid, flipped dick, you did the opposite
You stayed the same, cause cock backwards is still cock you pricks
I love it when I tell 'em shove it
Cause it wasn't that long ago when Marshall sat, luster lacked, flustered
Cuz he couldn't cut mustard, muster up nothing
Brain fuzzy, cause he's buzzin', woke up from that buzz
Now you wonder why he does it, how he does it
Wasn't cause he had buzzards circle around his head
Waiting for him to drop dead, was it?
Or was it, cause them bitches wrote him off
Little hussy ass fusses, cause fuck it, guess it doesn't matter now, does it
What difference it make?
What it take to get it through your thick skulls
As if this ain't some bullshit
People don't usually come back this way
From a place that was dark as I was in
Just to get to this place
Now let these words be like a switch blade to a haters rib cage
And let it be known from this day forward
I wanna just say thanks cause your hate is what gave me the strength
So let 'em bic's raise cause I came with 5'9′ but I feel like I'm 6'8″
This one's for you and me, living out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
With my arms out wide I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters
By the time you hear this I'll probably already be outtie
I advance like going from toting iron to going and buying 4 or 5 of the homies the iron man Audi
My daddy told me slow down, boy, you goin' to blow it
And I ain't gotta stop the beat a minute
To tell Shady I love him the same way that he did Dr Dre on the Chronic
Tell him how real he is or how high I am
Or how I would kill for him for him to know it
I cried plenty tears, my daddy got a bad back
So it's only right that I right till he can march right into that post office and tell 'em to hang it up
Now his career's Lebron's jersey in 20 years
I'll stop when I'm at the very top
You shitted on me on your way up
It's 'bout to be a scary drop
Cause what goes up must come down
You going down on something you don't wanna see like a hairy box
Every hour, happy hour now
Life is wacky now
Used to have to eat the cat to get the pussy
Now I'm just the cats meoww, ow
Classic now, always down for the catch weight like Pacquiao
Ya'll are doomed
I remember when T-Pain ain't wanna work with me
My car starts itself, parks itself and autotunes
Cause now I'm in the Aston
I went from having my city locked up
To getting treated like Kwame Kilpatrick
And now I'm fantastic
Compared to a weed high
And y'all niggas just gossipin' like bitches on a radio and TV
See me, we fly
Y'all buggin' out like Wendy Williams staring at a bee-hive
And how real is that
I remember signing my first deal and now I'm the second best I can deal with that
Now Bruno can show his ass, without the MTV awards gag
You and I know what it's like to be kicked down
Forced to fight
But tonight we're alright
So hold up your light
Let it shine
Cause this one's for you and me, living out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
With my arms out wide I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lightersI stay higher than racial tension, with a facial expression
Tensed up like I'm suffering from a case of nasal congestion
Eyes hazel complexion, beige, age still in question
Critics hate my tape, kids can't wait for the next one
As long as there's rejects, my tape never ejects the deck
That's the level of respect each CD gets
While ya'll graspin at straws like me snorting crushed Aspirin
And gasping at air and collapsing in malls
I'm just a realistic impression of artistic expression
Whose tape is in the deck when kids shot up the delicatessen
So when I launch a verse full of controverse
That'll haunt you worse than Ma$e before he joined a church
I'm sorry kids I dismissed this class
I'm going back in the broom closet to sniff this gas
Um, Mr. Mathers just missed the bathroom
Pissed his pants and the world still kissed his ass
This is my last album cause this is my last Valium
Just pick my ass up when I pass out in the bathroom
If ya'll don't like the shit that you're hearing
Just blow me til you lipstick is smearing
And I can see my dick disappearing

May 23rd
That means we're taking over this year, you heard? (x2)
Yo, May 23rd[Hook]
Step by step, heart to heart
Left right left, we all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart
We never win, but the battle wages on for toy soldiers

I'm supposed to be the soldier, who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I ain't never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it
Even if it means going toe to toe with a Benzino
It don't matter I'd never drag them in battles that I can handle
'less I absolutely have to, I'm supposed to set an example
I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em
If some shit ever does pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em
That Ja shit, I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
There's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it
It was crazy, the shit went way beyond some Jay-Z and Nas shit
And even though the battle is won I feel like we lost it
I spent so much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
And I'm so caught in it, I almost feel I'm the one who caused it
This ain't what I'm in hip hop for, it's not why I got in it
That was never my object, for someone to get killed
Why would I want to destroy something I helped build?
It wasn't my intentions, my intentions were good
I went through my whole career without ever mentioning [Suge]
And that was just outta respect, for not running my mouth
And talking about something that I knew nothing about
Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef
So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth
While he's all over TV, down talking the man
Who literally saved my life, like fuck it I understand
This is business, and this shit just isn't none of my business
I'm still knowing this shit could pop off at any minute, because


There used to be a time when, you could just say a rhyme and
Wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dying
But now it's elevated, cause once you put someone's kids in it
The shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more is it?
It's a different ball game, you call names and you ain't just rapping
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happening
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it, he wasn't going to go after him
Until Ja started yapping in magazines how he stabbed him
Fuck it, 50 smash him, mash him and let him have it
Meanwhile my attention's pulled in another direction
Some receptionist at the Source who answers phones at his desk
Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
But now he's fucked the game up, cause one of the ways I came up
Was through that publication, the same one that made me famous
Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothing?
Well fuck it, that mothafucka could get it too, fuck him then
But I'm so busy being pissed off, I don't stop to think
That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc
And he's inherited mine, which is fine, ain't like either of us mind
We still have soldiers that's on the front line
That's willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders
Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us
And maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in the chorus
To show 'em we love 'em back and let them know how important it is
To have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners
Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
But I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt or murdered
It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it
Than to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict
I'll walk away from it all 'fore I let it go any further
But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm copping
I'm just willing to be the bigger man if y'all can quit popping
Off at your jaws well then I can, cause frankly I'm sick of talking
I'm not going to let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience cause

I know there’s something in the wake of your smile
I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yeah
We’ve built a love but that love falls apart
A little piece of heaven turns to dark
Listen to your heart

There’s a certain mystique when I speak
That you notice that it’s sorta unique
Cause you know it’s me, my poetry’s deep
And I’m still matic the way I flow to this beat
You can’t sit still, it’s like tryin to smoke crack
And go to sleep, I’m strapped
Just knowing any minute I could snap
I’m the equivalent of what would happen if Bush rapped
I bully these rappers so bad lyrically
It ain’t even funny, I ain’t even hungry
It ain’t even money, you can’t pay me enough
For you to play me, it’s cockamamie
You just ain’t zany enough to rock with Shady
My noodle is cockadoodle, my clocks cuckoo
I got screws loose, yeahhh, the whole kitten-kaboodle
I’m just brutal. It’s no rumor, I’m numero uno, assume it
There’s no humor in it no more, you know
I’m rollin with a swollen bowling ball in my bag
You need a fag to come and tear a new hole in my ass


I’m supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I ain’t never supposed to show it, my crew ain’t supposed to know it
Even if it means goin’ toe to toe with a Benzino it don’t matter
I’d never drag them in battles that I can handle unless I absolutely have to
I’m supposed to set an example
I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide ‘em
If some shit ever does pop off, I’m supposed to be beside ‘em
That Ja shit I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
There’s a certain line you just don’t cross and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailie’s name on a song and I just lost it
It was crazy, this went way beyond some Jay-z and Nas shit
And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
I spent too much energy on it, honestly I’m exhausted
And I’m so caught in it I almost feel I’m the one who caused it
This ain’t what I’m in hip-hop for, it’s not why I got in it


I’m the man in my city ain’t nobody wit me
You can ask the real niggas and all the bad bitches
I’m a known drug dealer I always have 50′s
And the thugs and the killers was all in class wit me
SS’S on 26′s watching some television
Shorty I’m never slipping got the berretta in vision
And ready to pop the clip in, ready to get to tripping
Ready to show these folks a celebrity pistol whipping
Pimp stolen’ the automobile and the roof for the tag missing
Polices’ try to pursue me it’s nothing but gas given
Addicted to fast living, guess I’m one of my dad’s children
Think I’m bad now shoulda seen me before I had children
Give dick to ya daddy’s daughter and dare her to have children?
Hope he got some insurance ’cause death her is enduring?
Kill her in Mississippi and drive her to Missouri
Still my wet paint drippin’ while I’m woodgrain gripping


There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme
And wouldn’t have to worry about one of your people dyin’
But now it’s elevated cause once you put someone’s kids in it
The shit gets escalated, it ain’t just words no more is it?
It’s a different ball game, you callin’ names and you ain’t just rappin’
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin’
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it he wasn’t gonna go after him
Until Ja started yappin’ in magazines how we stabbed him
Fuck it 50 smash ‘em, mash on ‘em, let him have it
Meanwhile my attention is pullin’ in other directions
Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk
Has an erection for me and thinks that I’ll be his resurrection
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
But now he’s fucked the game up cause one of the ways I came up
Was through that publication the same one that made me famous

To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment...
Would you capture it or just let it slip?

(Yo) His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting

What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin' how, everybody's jokin' now
The clocks runs out, time's up, over, blow

Snap back to reality, oh, there goes gravity, oh
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy no, he won't have it he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter he's dope

He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant he knows
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime (You better)

His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring, but super-stardom's

Close to postmortem, it only grows harder
Only grows hotter, he blows us all over
These hoes is all on him, coast to coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads God only knows

He's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home, and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product

They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada, so the soap opera
Is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partna'
But the beat goes on, da da dum da dum da da da dum

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime (You better)

No more games, I'mma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off, like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage

But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cipher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine to five

And I can't provide the right type of
Life for my family, cause man these goddamn
Food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life

And these times are so hard, and it's getting even harder
Tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a Prima Donna
Baby mama drama screamin' on and too much for me to wanna

Stay in one spot, another day of monotony
Has gotten me to the point I'm like a snail I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not

Mom I love you, but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot, feet fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime (You better)

You can do anything you set your mind to, man[Intro]
Look, if you had, one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it, or just let it slip?
Yo

His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already: mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over - blaow
Snap back to reality, oh, there goes gravity
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy nope, he won't have it, he knows

You can do anything you set your mind to, man[Intro]
Yo, if you could just, for one minute
Or one split second in time, forget everything
Everything that bothers you, all your problems
Everything, and follow me

If I was frozen inside of a moment
If I could capture time inside a capsule
An hourglass full of sand in the palm of my hand, it passes through it
If I can grasp it, and just control what happens to it
Then I can trap it, so no more time elapses through it
If raps could do it, maybe I could tap into it
Then I could try to channel it through Cadillacs and Buicks
To transmit through 'em, to make you put your ass into it
And that's when you hit the roof because you can't sit through it
Your passions too much for you to not be dancing to it
And as you do it, your movements become fast and fluent
You're mashin' to it, moshing until you're black and bluish
You're acting foolish, this music it has influenced you to be rowdy but in an orderly fashion
True it's chaotic, but it's got your body moving as a unit
Uniting together tonight, so make it last and you better just

Lose yourself in this music
This moment we own it, we won't never let it go (Go)
You better move yourself cause tomorrow's ass can wait
There is no time, to sit there and procrastinate (you better)
Lose yourself in this music
This moment we own it, we won't never let it go (Go)
You better move yourself cause tomorrow's ass can wait
There is no time, to sit there and procrastinate (you better)

Cause when we descend together, we begin to move as one
In perfect unison just like the moon and sun
Illuminate the room and humans soon become aluminum
Rhythmically in sync, if you'll excuse the pun
But if you could lose it once, I mean if you could let shit go
Relax, take a breath, and just let it exit slow
To rest your soul, you could leave the rest to me
If I could give the world a hit of ecstasy
To make 'em feel the feeling that I'm feeling right this minute
Cause I feel like the night won't end til I get finished
So close the shades, makin' sure no light gets in it
The sky's the limit tonight because the night's infinite
A high percentage of black people and white mixed in it
But no one really gives a fuck cause they just like what's spinnin'
His life was spinnin', the whole entire night just spinnin'
Like life's beginning, so come out from inside your skin and quit hidin' in it

Lose yourself in this music
This moment we own it, we won't never let it go (Go)
You better move yourself cause tomorrow's ass can wait
There is no time, to sit there and procrastinate (you better)
Lose yourself in this music
This moment we own it, we won't never let it go (Go)
You better move yourself cause tomorrow's ass can wait
There is no time, to sit there and procrastinate (you better)(For all the ladies out there)
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
And now you're lying in the corner crying...
(Cheering)[Produced by Rick Rubin]

Something's burning, I can't figure out what (out what)
It's either lust or a cloud of dust
Judgement is clouded, must just be the powder from the power of (love)
But I'm in something I don't know how to get out of
Left my girl in the house alone, is that my soon to be spouse’s moan
And the further I walk, the louder
Pause for a minute to make certain that's what I heard
Cause after all, this is her place
So I give her the benefit of the doubt I
Think I might be about to busta, bust her
The thought's scary, yo, though and it hurts - brace
Hope it ain't, "Here we go, yo," cause my head already goes to worst case Scenario, though in the first place
But you confirmed my low end theory though
Should've known when I made it all the way to third base
And that was only the first date
Could've made it to home plate
But you slid straight for the dome and dove face
First, "no (slurp) you don't (slurp) under (slurp) stand (slurp)
I (slurp) don't (slurp) do (slurp) this for anyone, ever"
Yeah that ain't what they all say
I'll say, you can suck a softball through a straw
Used to be my fiance
'Til you sucked on Wayne, Andre, and Kanye
LeBron, Akon, Jay, Lil Jon, Raekwon, Ma$e, Polow Tha Don, Dre
Dante Ross, James Conway, Kwame
Guess I'm gettin' my g-god dang Jigga on, eh
Cause your name, I'm beyond sayin'
But fuck it, I'm movin' on, you women are all cray
But I'll probably always keep on playing

The game of love, love, love, love
La-la-la-la-la love

She doesn't love me, no she don't love me no more
She hates my company, yeah she don't love me no more
I tried to get her up out of my head, left my bags at the door
She screamed she loved me like she never did before
And I told her
(Go where you wanna go, go do whatcha want to do; I don't care)
And I told her
(Go where you wanna go, go do whatcha want to do; I don't care)

I told that bitch
I'm a sucker for love, you're a sucker for dick
Sucking dick in your momma tub, then your granny walked in
Told the stupid nigga to duck under the water
He drowned, like an abortion, they booked you for manslaughter
You beat the case and I called ya
"Sherane is not available now leave a message at the tone
And Kendrick don't forget to buy two pair of those
Expensive heels, you little fucking Ferris Wheel
Fucking spinning on me, fuck you think we gon' get married still?
Fucking Mary had a little lamb, this ain't no fairy tale
Fairy godmomma better tell you how I fucking feel
Like you should fuckin' beat it or fucking eat it while I'm on my period
Now have a blessed day," bitch, you serious
I'm in the mirror with this look on my face, curious
Why you ain't fucking with me, you cut me deep as a Caesarean
You know I want you bad as a Benjamin, I'm delirious
I want you bad as the head shattered on George Zimmerman
After the Dillinger hit him diligently and killing him
His mouthpiece for a Cadillac emblem
That's analogy and metaphor for you
I should win a medal for all the ways I adore you
This is me talking cordial, yeah I got some home trainin'
That ain't what you like, ain't it, what about if I was as famous
As Marshall? Would you give fellatio in the carpool?
Cops pull us over, they just wanna know if you gargle
Singin' "I hope she's good enough"
Meanwhile you're chasing her
Chlamydia couldn't even get rid of her
Pity the fool and pity the fool in me, I'ma live with the

The game of love, love, love, love
La-la-la-la-la love

She doesn't love me, no she don't love me no more
She hates my company, yeah she don't love me no more
I tried to get her up out of my head, left my bags at the door
She screamed she loved me like she never did before
And I told her
(Go where you wanna go, go do whatcha want to do; I don't care)
And I told her
(Go where you wanna go, go do whatcha want to do; I don't care)

So needless to say I'm feelin' betrayed
Snatch my house key off her key chain
She jumps off Wee-Bey from The Wire's dick
Now she's chasing me with a cheese grater
Here goes that broken record, cliché, it's all my fault anyway
She's turning the tables, I'm a beat-break
She treats my face like Serato, she cuts and scratches like a DJ
Each day is an Instant Replay
They say what we display, is symptomatic of attack behavior
Back together but forgot today was her b-day, she cut me off on the freeway
Simple misunderstanding but just as I went to slam on the brakes
That's when I realized that she may be as crazy as me, wait
Bitch cut my fucking brakeline, stepped on them fuckers 8 times
Still goin' 73, thank God there's an exit coming up
What the mother F-U-C-K's wrong with her?
Hit the off ramp 'til I coasted to a goddamn halt, hit a fucking tree
Now here she comes at full speed, she's racing at me, okay
You wanna fuck with me, eh?
Snatch the bitch out her car through the window, she screaming
I body slam her on the cement, until the concrete gave
And created a sinkhole, buried this stink ho in it
Then pay to have the street repaved
(The fuck?) Woke up in a dream state
In a cold sweat like I got hit with a freeze ray during a heat wave
Guess I eventually caved though, cause she's laying next to me in bed
Directly aiming a gat at my head!
Woke up again and jumped up like fuck it, I've had it, I'm checking into rehab
I confess I'm a static addict, I guess that's why I'm so clingy
Every girl I've ever had either says I got too much baggage
Or I'm too fucking dramatic
Man what the fuck is the matter, I'm just a fucking romantic
I fucking love you, you fucking bitch!
Combative, possessive, in fact last time I was mad at an ex
I actually set off a chain reaction of tragic events
I said, "Hit the road" and after she left, I sent that bitch a text
I said, "Be careful driving, don't read this and have an accident!"
She glanced to look at it and wrecked
Too bad, thought we had a connect, no sense dwelling makes
Never been a more compelling case
Than the model covered in L'Oreal and mace
Who fell from grace eleven stories for storytelling
While the whore was yelling, "Rape"
'Til her vocal cords were swelling
And her voice were more hoarser than Tori Spellings' face
Still they swarm the gates
And my fancy estates to greet Norman Bates with a warm embrace
Unless you're Andrea Yates, don't ask me for a date
Don't be late, well the sentiment's great
But wait, think there's been a mistake
You wanted an intimate date, I wanna intimidate
I have infinite hate in my blood
It's mainly because of the game of, (*Message sound*)
"Wait, dinner at eight?"
I have infinite hate in my blood
It's mainly because of the game of...

Love, love, love, love
L-l, l-l-l-love[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
Niggas, I'm still grinding (yeah), I still hearing those sirens
I'm still getting chased by those lights
Only the light's lime, and my mic's on
And my time is none, because I'm writing more
And I ain't here to meet a soul in this business
I'm here to eat, speak, until these ho's feel this
I ain't gonna let you derail me, man
I got Young Kobie homey, you gotta let go of Obie
Cause Obie be back, (going nowhere, man) we got them craps going on
And that yac going on, soon as a nigga touch down, back from touring
It's whatever, put that on the cheddar, man
But in the meantime, it's Jimmy Iovine time
Chase cheese, rhyme 'til my voice give out
This is it my niggas, this what we boast about
Now I'm here, so shut your motherfucking mouth, and show me love, bitch

I just wanna love ya, for the rest of my life (I don't love you, bitch)
I wanna hold you in the mornin, hold you through the night
(Right we wanna love alcohol, we wanna love guns, we wanna love money
We don't love no bitches, though)
I just wanna love, for the rest of my life
I wanna hold you in the mornin, hold you through the night

There's a certain mystique when I speak, that you notice
Cause it's sort of unique cause you know it's me
My poetry's deep, and I'm Stillmatic, the way I flow to this beat
You can't sit still, it's like trying to smoke crack and go to sleep
I'm strapped, it's known any minute I could snap
I'm the equivalent of what would happen if Bush rapped
I bully these rappers so bad lyrically
It ain't even funny, I ain't even hungry, it ain't even money
You can't pay me enough for you to play me
It's cockamanie you just ain't zany enough to rock with Shady
My noodle is cock-a-doodle, my clock's coo-coo
I got screws loose, yea the whole kit and caboodle, I'm just brutal
It's no rumor, I'm numero uno, assume it
There's no more humor in it, you know
I'm rolling with a swollen bowling ball in my bag
You need a fag to come and tear a near hole in my ass, you better love me, bitch


My buzz is crazy in the hood, they holla my name
If it ain't about the flow, it's 'bout the stones and the chain
If I was you, I'd love me too, I roll like a boss
Nine eleven Porsche same color as cranberry sauce
I ain't gon' front, I thought R. Kelly was the shit
Let me find out he fucking 'round with Bow Wow bitch
Niggas eating popcorn right, rewinding the tape
Now shorty mama in precinct, hollering rape
I'm convinced, man, something really wrong with these ho's
I thought Lil' Kim was hot, 'til she start fucking with her nose
I used to listen to Lauryn Hill, and tap my feet
Then the bitch put out a CD and didn't have no beats
That boy D'Angelo, he determined not to fail
That nigga went butt-ass, for his record to sell
My back shots 'll help Ashanti hit them high notes
And Big Ben taught Charli B'More to deep throat (yea)

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

I can't tell you what it really is
I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffing paint and I love her the more I suffer
I suffocate and right before I'm about to drown
She resuscitates me, she fucking hates me and I love it
“Wait, where you going?” “I'm leaving you” “No you ain't”
Come back, we're running right back here we go again
It's so insane, cause when it's going good it's going great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad it's awful
I feel so ashamed, I snap, “who's that dude?”
I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

You ever love somebody so much
You can barely breathe when you're with them?
You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit them
Got that warm fuzzy feeling, yeah them chills used to get them
Now you're getting fucking sick of looking at them?
You swore you'd never hit them, never do nothing to hurt them
Now you're in each other's face
Spewing venom in your words when you spit them
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit them
Throw them down, pin them
So lost in the moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over it controls you both
So they say it's best to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know you cause today, that was yesterday
Yesterday is over it's a different day
Sound like broken records playing over
But you promised her next time you'd show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window guess that's why they call it window pane


Now I know we said things, did things, that we didn't mean
And we fall back into the same patterns, same routines
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
When it comes to love you're just as blinded
Baby please come back, it wasn't you, baby it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time
I apologize even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back
I know I'm a liar, if she ever tries to fucking leave again
I'mma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire

Still love me? Take this
You ready? One, two, three

The more you, put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
Cause you love me, and I love you more

It's sick but who could ever predict, we'd be doin' the same shit
We say we do it for our baby but we don't
We do it for us, it's lust cause neither one
Of us trust each other, so we fuck 'til we bust
And we cuss each other, out, we know what it's about, shout
'til I throw you out the house, you throw me out the house
I throw you on the couch, punch you in the mouth
Fist fight 'til we turn this mother out
Then apologize after, laughter, pain
It's insane we're back in the same chapter again
And it's sad but it's true, when I'm layin' here with you
There ain't nothin' anyone could ever say or ever do cause


Cause I hate you, do you hate me?
Good, cause you're so fuckin' beautiful when you're angry
It makes me, wanna just take you and just throw you
On the bed and fuck you like I don't even know you
You fuck other people and I fuck other people
You're a slut, but I'm equal, I'm a mutt, we're both evil
In our ways but neither one of us would ever admit it
Cause one us would have one up on the other so forget it
We can make accusations, people spread rumors
But they ain't got proof, 'till they do it's just the two of us
It's you and me, cause any chick can say that she screwin' me
But you gotta believe me to a degree cause true indeed
If you didn't I wouldn't be hittin', yeah I would
Cause the sex is too damn good, if I ran who would I run to
That would be this soft and warm
So it's off and on, usually more off than on
But at least we know, that we share this common bond
You're the only one I can fuck without a condom on
I hope, the only reason that I cope is cause of that fact
And plus I can bust in that and that's why


I can never understand it, that's why I don't try
From junior high until we both die, it's silly
Oh why must we try, is it really so rough
That we must always call each other's Billy Goat's Gruff
Try to pull each other's legs, until the other begs
We're lyin' to ourselves, that's the beauty of it geah
Cause we truly love each other, that's why we always fighting
All we do is shove each other every other fuckin' night
And it's clear it ain't gon' change, it's pent up rage
We both had, we both feel like we've been upstaged
By someone else, we've both been someone else's someone else
And the problem is neither one wants help
It's an addiction and it can't be fixed
Our family's mixed up, there's a baby sister in the mix
And it hurts cause the pieces to the puzzle don't fit
And anybody who thinks they know us doesn't know shit
And they're probably just tired of hearin' it all the time
On every song, every lyric and every rhyme
All the hoop-la, all the whoopty-woo
What you put me through, fuckin' whoopty-do
But I won't be made a fool of, if this is true love
You wouldn't do what, you did last time, you wouldn't screw up
This time, cause this time girl I'm tellin' you what
You do it again I'm fuckin' you up

No matter what you say, or what you do
I'mma hunt you down 'til I find you
No matter where you run, I'll be right there
Right behind you, in your nightmares
So I brought you the flowers, and the candy
All the times that you threw it back at me
So when you hate me, you gon' hate me more
When you find out, you can't escape me whore


"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed"
I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from

Warning, this shit's gon' be rated R, Restricted
You see this bullet hole in my neck? It's self inflicted
Doctor slapped my momma, "Bitch you got a sick kid"
Arrested, molested myself and got convicted
Wearing visors, sunglasses and disguises
Cause my split personality is having an identity crisis
I'm Dr. Hyde and Mr. Jekyll, disrespectful
Hearing voices in my head while these whispers echo
(Murder-murder, redrum)
Brain size of a bread crumb, which drug will I end up dead from?
Inebriated 'til my stress is alleviated
"How in the fuck can Eminem and Shady be related?"
Illiterate, illegitimate shit spitter
Bitch getter, hid in the bush like Margot Kidder
Jumped out, killed the bitch and did her
Used to let the babysitter suck my dick when I was littler
Smoke a blunt while I'm titty fucking Bette Midler
Sniper, waiting on your roof like the Fiddler
Y'all thought I was gonna rhyme with Riddler, didn't ya?
Bring your bitch I wanna see if this dick gon' fit in her


I lace tunes, I'm out this world like space moons
With a bunch crazed loons dismissin brains like graze wounds
Nothing but idiots and misfits, dipshits
Doing whippits, passed out like Sanford snippets
Where's the weed, I wanna tamper with it
I'mma let your grandpa hit it, mix it up with cocaine so he can't forget it
Fuck it, maybe I'm a bum
But I was put on this earth to make your baby mama cum
So what I'm on is way beyond the bomb
Or any alcoholic beverage, losing all of my leverage
Went up inside the First National Bank broke, and left rich
Walking bio-hazard causing wreckage, smoked out like Eckrich
Bandage making my neck itch, what the fuck? Give me the check bitch
You just lost your tip, there's a pubic hair in my breakfast
Got shit popping off like bottle cap tips
Get your cap peeled like the dead skin of your mama's chapped lips
Slap dips, support domestic violence
Beat your bitch's ass while your kids stare in silence
I'm just joking, is Dirty Dozen really dust smoking?
If all your shit's missing, than probably one of us broke in


My head's ringing, like it was Spider Sense tingling
Blitz ya like Green Bay did when they shitted on New England
I'm out the game, put the second string in
This Brandy got me swinging, bobbing back and forth like a penguin
Delinquent, toking microphones with broken English
Make your mama be like "Ooh, this is good! Who sing this?"
"Slim Shady, his tape is dope, I love it
It's rugged, but he needs to quit talking all that drug shit"
It was predicted by a medic
I'd grow to be an addicted diabetic, living off liquid Triaminic
Pathetic, but I don't think this headache's ever vanishing
Panicing, I think I might have just took too much Anacin
Frozen mannequin, posted stiffer than a statue
I think I'm dying, God is that you?
Somebody help me, before I OD on an LP
Take me to ER ASAP for an IV
Motherfuck JLB, they don't support no hip hop
They say that's where it ends, the closest they gon' come is 2Pac
It's politics, it's all a fix, set up by these white blue-collared hicks
Just to make a dollar off of black music with a subliminal ball of tricks
But those can kiss ass and swallow dicks

*Talking*
I'm allowed to fuck up whenever... whenever I want...
This the Outhouse...
Lemme smoke a joint first...
Here, Pace...
95% of all y'all rappers butt
And y'all ride dick so much y'all gon' make me nuts
You'll get your jaw clocked, I'll drag your ass for four blocks
Dunk your head in Clorox, use your dreads for my floor mop
Gay or straight, my Papermate'll do a date rape
Zee can't wait, I'll go Great Bank on a blank tape
Lost like Spigg Nice, stick you for your thick ice
Good to hit twice 'fore you catch me usin' trick dice
Go to parole off of two in stolen wheels
My colon holdin' pills, fuck takin' some Golden Seal
I smoke leaky and black like BET
And fuck hoes raw dog 'til my balls catch VD
Mess with us, straight up, y'all better bust
I'm the one you'll never dust, it's still the same as it ever was
I'll leave the crowd in a Coupe with white walls
And scream, "If y'all ain't Outz then y'all could ride my balls!"
Beef with us you might just catch a black eye
And ride for your crispy 850-I
I fuck with them drugs 'cuz it gets me high
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-macosa
Been doin' this rap shit since '85
Then 'Clef put me down with the Fugee-la
It's only right me and Yah get a piece of the pie
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-macosa
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Ma-macosa
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Ma-macosa
Mama-se, Ma-sa, Ma-macosa
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Ma-macosa

Yo, all the boys in the lobby get needles filled with poison ivy
Put 'em in the hospital and give 'em a poison IV
My crew get high much off brew and Thai skunk
It makes my style off the wall like suicide jumps
We sip lots of liq' shots
It makes my hip-hop fat as your lip got when I
Kickboxed with flip-flops
And give a disk jockey six copies of this floppy
Shit I be dyin' for is your piece of shit hobby?
You borin' like Oran Dice, I'm more than hype
Bungee jumpin with cordless mics, for tourists sites
Ton Slanga, I'm dopin', pills and cokin'
Lung cancer in my throat and still smokin'

Now, when your partner die, who got the right
To do the homicide and you shot the guy?
And when you's 'bout to cry who got you high?
Say Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-macosa
I'll blast the guy that don't pass the lye
Leave him paralized and agonized
Fellas, grab the thighs that's by your side
Say Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-macosa

Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-maco
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-maco
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-maco
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-maco

Wanna live this Outsida business
Blunt splitters, all that
Multiple musical contracts to fallback...
On... set like I was Liu Kang for Kombat...
Armed like Emmit when I rush crews
More hardcore than DMC and Krush Groove
Don't need hands to touch you
Mr. Perfect, the one you want to rap like
The name rap fiends have in their mouth like a crack pipe
Slap the fuck out you, remember us
I'm the man your father never was, or could've been
Maybe if they passed out weed in high school, I would've went
Got it down, yo
Even if you sing like Brownstone you couldn't "Take The Crown Home"
Try to call me out and get the dial tone
Pace Woner, dickin' 5-0 in a stolen gray Hummer

Me and Pace had to flee in haste from bein' chased
For some E & Js we boosted out of some Korean place
I get drunk and hang-glide off of St. Ides'
And spray-paint the plain sides of all the subway train rides
I got a pitbull that eats sheep and spits wool
And chews on human body tissue 'til its stomach gets full
Skip school, barely went to class, thinkin' shit's cool
Hid a loaded pistol under this retarded kid's stool
I had a dream I blew up with half a mil' sold
And still stole a credit card, a purse, and someone's billfold
I'm from the city where the weather's always real cold
And chill mode can turn into somebody gettin' steel-toed
We be hangin' on the block 'til dawn
Stayin' spaced out like Dr. Octagon
Feelin' for the beats like they Chaka Khan
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-macosa
Pace Won, Slang Ton, and Yah
Young Zee, Az-Izz, D.U., and muah
Bizarre Kid, Loon One and Rah
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-macosa

Beef with us you might just catch a black eye
And ride for your crispy 850-I
We fuck with them drugs 'cuz it gets us high
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-macosa
Been doin' this rap shit since '85
Then 'Clef put me down with the Fugee-la
It's only right me and Yah get a piece of the pie
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-macosa
Mama-se, Ma-sa, Ma-macosa
Mama-se, Ma-sa, Ma-macosa
Mama-se, Ma-sa, Macosa
Mama-mama-mama-mama-macosa[Eminem]
Hi, my name is, my name is nobody famous
Guess what? I'm an anus
I'm here with Mancow, haha
You know how I do it, cause I kick this fluid when i do it
I bust it, I kill it and I crush it with Mancow
You don't understand how we do it
We land now with hits and freestyle flows
Cuz we the ish, I said ish backwards and guess what that is...
Shhh, yea I can't say that, yo, hit the playback
Check it, cause rappers don't know how to display that
Rhymes that I be kicking, freestyle when I be kicking
Sticking these, ribs sticking out, poverty stricken
I'm all hungry cause I ain't ate in ten minutes
I'm infinite, oh, hey, check it out, I'm Ken Kaniff

Oh, hi there man, oh yeah
Hell no bro, oh yeah, no, yeah
Oh here I am I'm chillin' with Mancow
You know how we do it man you know we got the know how
Mancow kick a freestyle[Intro]
You know I just don't get it
Last year I was nobody, this year I'm selling records
Now everybody wants to come around like I owe em something
The fuck you want from me, ten million dollars? Get the fuck outta here

You see I'm just Marshall Mathers
I'm just a regular guy, I don't know why all the fuss about me
Nobody ever gave a fuck before, all they did was doubt me
Now everybody wanna run their mouth and try to take shots at me

You might see me jogging, you might see me walking
You might see me walking a dead rottweiler dog
With its head chopped off in the park with a spiked collar
Hollering at him cause the son of a bitch won't quit barking
Or leaning out a window with a cocked shotgun
Driving up the block in the car that they shot Pac in
Looking for Big's killers, dressing ridiculous
Blue-and-red, like I don't see what the big deal is
Double barrel 12-gauge bigger than Chris Wallace
Pissed off cause Biggie and Pac just missed all this
Watching all these cheap imitations get rich off 'em
And get dollars that should've been theirs like they switched wallets
And amidst all this Crist' popping and wrist watches
I just sit back and just watch and just get nauseous
And walk around with an empty bottle of Remy Martin
Starting shit like some 26-year-old skinny Cartman (Goddamn it)
An anti-Backstreet and Ricky Martin
Whose instinct's to kill N'Sync, don't get me started
These fucking brats can't sing and Britney's garbage
What is this bitch, retarded? Give me back my sixteen dollars
All I see is sissies in magazines smiling
Whatever happened to wiling out and being violent?
Whatever happened to catching a good old-fashioned
Passionate ass-whooping and getting your shoes coat and your hat tooken

New Kids on the Block sucked a lot of dick, boy/girl groups make me sick
And I can't wait 'til I catch all you faggots in public, I'mma love it

Vanilla Ice don't like me, said some shit in Vibe to spite me
Then went and dyed his hair just like me
A bunch of little kids wanna swear just like me
And run around screaming, I don't care, just bite me (Nah-nah)
I think I was put here to annoy the world
And destroy your little four-year-old boy or girl
Plus I was put here to put fear in faggots who spray Faygo Root Beer
And call themselves clowns cause they look queer
Faggy 2 Dope and Silent Gay
Claiming Detroit, when y'all live twenty miles away (fucking faggots)
And I don't wrestle, I'll knock you fucking faggots the fuck out
Ask 'em about the club they was at when they snuck out
After they ducked out the back when they saw us and bugged out
Ducked down and got paintballs shot at they truck, blaow
Look at y'all running your mouth again
When you ain't seen a fucking mile road south of 10
And I don't need help from D12 to beat up two females
In make-up who may try to scratch me with Lee Nails
Slim Anus? You damn right, slim anus
I don't get fucked in mine like you two little flaming faggots

Cause I'm just Marshall Mathers
I'm not a wrestler guy, I'll knock you out if you talk about me
Come and see me on the streets alone if you assholes doubt me
And if you wanna run your mouth, then come take your best shot at me

Is it because you love me that y'all expect so much of me?
You little groupie bitch, get off me go fuck Puffy
Now because of this blonde mop that's on top
Of this fucked up head that I've got I've gone pop
The underground just spunned around and did a 360
Now these kids diss me and act like some big sissies
"Oh, he just did some shit with Missy
So now he thinks he's too big to do some shit with MC Get-Bizzy"
My fucking bitch mom's suing for ten million
She must want a dollar for every pill I've been stealing
Shit, where the fuck you think I picked up the habit
All I had to do was go in her room and lift up her mattress
Which is it bitch: Mrs. Briggs or Ms. Mathers?
It doesn't matter [your attorney Fred Gibson's a] faggot
Talking about I fabricated my past
He's just aggravated I won't ejaculate in his ass
So tell me, what the hell is a fella to do
For every million I make, another relative sues
Family fighting and fussing over who wants to invite me to supper
All of a sudden, I got ninety-some cousins
A half-brother and sister who never seen me
Or even bothered to call me until they saw me on TV
Now everybody's so happy and proud
I'm finally allowed to step foot in my girlfriend's house (Hey!)
And then to top it off I walked to the news stand
To buy this cheap-ass little magazine with a food stamp
Skipped to the last page, flipped right fast
And what do I see? A picture of my big White ass
Okay, let me give you mothafuckas some help
Um here, "XXL! XXL!"
Now your magazine shouldn't have so much trouble to sell
Ahh fuck it, I'll even buy a couple myself

Maxine! (Phone Rings)

Maxine: Hello
Denaun: Can I speak to Maxine?
Maxine: Yeah this is me what's up?
Denaun: What up?
Maxine: Who dis?
Denaun: Denaun
Maxine: Yeah what's up?
Denaun: What are you doing?
Maxine: Nothing, just laying in bed
Denaun: Huh?
Maxine: Nothing, just laying in bed
Denaun: Why?
Maxine: I don't know, thinking about something freaky to do

I know this crack fiend, Maxine, who needs a vaccine
She tests positive, but tells you that her act's clean
Plus she got a sugar daddy
Gassing every hooker that he takes in to crook her badly
If you mistook her, sadly, on her reputation
You're in jeopardation, if you ain't got no preparation
When you stepped away, son, she got her face done
Lookin' provocative, she'll let you knock it if
You press the issue, and get undressed to kiss you
If you match the price, otherwise she won't look at you twice
But when you catch the lice, or get the urgency
To go to the emergency cause it burns to pee
Don't bring your germs to me, cause I ain't tryna hear it
While you're fightin' your fuckin' disease tryna clear it (Maxine!!)

Sometimes I wonder, what's your purpose in life? That is
To get with every brother and unveil one of his kids, shit
You livin' trife, got three kids at home and club-hoppin' every night
You say it's gonna stop but it just... slows... down
And then speeds back to a regular pace, there is no end to this
Mystery, whatever your reason even is to be
You say you wanna be with me, but how can you say that
When you got niggas hiding in your closet
I refrain from getting angry but you keep on that strangely

I met this girl last week, she was a freak, and she liked me
So I stepped on it and then asked my homies
And chilled on the side and then watched they niggas
Big game over there and take notes, while I get this number
I stepped to her first I cleared my throat and said "Hey Bitch..
Haven't I seen you before?", looked at my nigga
Turned around and got slapped throughout my hands
And said "Oh it's like that?"
She said she just broke up with her nigga and shit
She started crying, and asked me to forgive her and shit
She said her name was Maxine, so I told her I wanted her number
She asked could I give her mine two
Got to the crib and called her up
We got into a good conversation that's when she asked me could I fuck
I said "Maxine check this out
Give me your address I'll be through and you'll find out"
Got to the crib she let me in
She didn't waste time she grabbed my hand and proceeded to the bedroom
I said "Hold up, and stop proceeding, you rushing things"
What the fuck are you doing?
So I went for my protection, took off my clothes and started flexing
As she went for my midsection
I threw her down as I tore off her shirt
Pulled out my jimmy and I thought about putting in work
Before I hit it she said
"3 don't get mad but there's something that I gotta tell your ass"
I said "What is it, another nigga? It's ok"
She said "No I forgot to tell you, that I got AIDS"
I got up out

Denaun: Hey, Maxine
Maxine: What
Denaun: You thinking about sucking my dick?
Maxine: Yeah for a small price
Denaun: For a small price? What you mean?
Maxine: You know, money nigga
Denaun: You don't need no damn money
I can't give you no money anyways, I heard you got some shit
Maxine: (laughing) What you, what you hear I got?
Denaun: AIDS
Maxine: (laughing) Who told you that bullshit?
Denaun: My nigga Kyu, he wouldn't lie
Maxine: Well if that's the case, Kyu got it then
Denaun: Oh for real, it's like that?
Maxine: (laughing) Well I ain't got shit
So he ain't got shit, and if he do, he ain't get that shit from me
I ain't fucking around with no 3rd nigga
Denaun: Fuck that, I ain't fucking with you
Maxine: No, see..
Denaun: You got that shit, I ain't gotta fuck with you
Maxine: Hold on, why it ain't even like that
Denaun: I want ya'll to get paid, fucking..
Maxine: (laughing as the phone hangs up)[Intro]
Ohh, my goodness! What have I done?
Oh no (oh no) I can't believe it! (believe it)
It's like (it's like)
I've got the whole WORLD, in my palm (in my palm)
And I'm ready to drop bombs

Welcome to the Slim Shady Mecca, Rebecca
It's the village in New York right next to the Tribeca
That's my sector, homosexual dissector
Come again, rewind selector!
I said nice rectum, I had a vasectomy Hector
So you can't get pregnant if I bisexually wreck ya
Hannibal Lecter into guy sex, and I bet ya
I tantalize ya and in less than five seconds I get ya
They say once bitten and twice shy
Well I lie next to the guy
With nine ecstasy pills and five extra
Boxes of ribbed condoms in quantities, why yessir
I took the rest of the Lunesta pills from my dresser
That's my kind of vibe; what else should I try, Lester?
Drop-kick the bitch before her second trimester
Perform the home abortion with Dexter then I guess I'll
Dig her fetus out with a wire hanger then digest her

I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
The world is just my medicine ball, you're all in
I said I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
My medicine ball, you're in my medicine ball friends

All my Westside bitches throw it up
Put a balloon inside your pussy, queef and blow it up
Man I think that he just fell off the deep end, sho' enough
So you better change the station to keep from throwin up
Man you seen it all before, you're all too familiar with it
There's a penis on the floor and two balls so you know who did it
You know you with it girl, don't front, oh no you didn't
I won't rape all the Pussycat Dolls? Nicole you kiddin?
I'll pee on Rihanna, see man I do what I wanna
Spray perfume in the sauna room, crazy gluing Madonna
To the La-Z-Boy sofa, fold her in two then sit on her
Imagine a visual for that man, who woulda thought I
Could ever be such a relentless prick unleashing his vengeace
But the chick's so old she looks like she out-lived a life sentence
I never meant this, rhyme to be so offensive
If you weren't so defensive it wouldn't be, you're so sensitive!


Put Christopher Reeves on a unicycle with a kickstand
Kick it up and push him and lead him right into quicksand
Here, you need a hand, big man? Grab hold of this branch
With both hands, man they don't understand I'm just a sick man
Now everybody's pissed at me - like it's my fault
His name rhymes with so many different words, jeez!
So one last time, Mr. Christopher Reeves
Won't you break it down for me and just spit the verse, please?
"Eminem, I'm coming to kill you {*sniffs*}
Always hated you and I still do
You'll never fill my shoes, my Superman costume {*sniffs*}
Doesn't even fit you, they don't feel you
You're taking this shit too far {*sniffs*}
Who do you think you are? Hang my suit up in the armoire
Every day I hate you more and more, throw down the cardboard
Let's breakdance if you think you're hardcore"

Once again, it's the sinister cynical minister Shady
Kryptonite to Superman, he's a dentist to Amy
Administerer of the pain, he just finished huffin' the paint
And muffler fumes like it was nothin', because it ain't
Anything in his way, his enemies he just slays
His venom he sprays, reaches like beams of energy rays
Menacing stares, he glares, making the hairs
All on the back of ya neck stand like Dracula, yep
Spectacular rep, he's a tarantula, gargantuan
Yeah, Angela, so I command ya to start dancin'
Part Manson, part Hannibal, part mechanical shark
Throwing animal parts at Scarlett Johansen
Enter my gas chamber, you gangsta? My ass
He's got his fangs to your neck, he's set to strangle ya ass, hater
You're facin' a task greater, he's chasin' your ass
He's got his face in a mask, your blood stains on his glass table

I'm checking the exposure of photos of me exposing
Myself locked inside of a cozy hotel posing
With or without clothing, next to the decomposing
Bodies eroding while I'm dozing off, overdosing
Windows opening, shutting; doors opening, closing
I think there's a ghost, too much hydrocodone and codeine
I was only 'sposed to swallow a half, I took the whole thing
I'm not joking, I think I just snorted my nose ring
I need a drink, I'm standing over the sink hosing
Myself, self-loathing, cause I'm on a brink, mostly
I don't wanna think; this will make everything rosy
Beverly sings, scream while I'm severing three toesies
Totally frozen while I close in
I'm yodelling "Rosie, won't you come out to play?"
And no sense wasting time, cutting and pasting headlines
In the papers, making shrines of my crimes and capers
My words are whirlwinds, I murder my girlfriends
Go to Europe and put Nurofens in my syrup and stirred 'em
You never heard 'em like this, so don't encourage him
The neurosurgeon, coke mirrors, and lyrics worse than
The kinda person to get Katie Couric to cursin'
Eighty spirits of ladies cause Shady murdered the virgins
Crazy, turn him, convinced that he emerged
Took over the world and reeled in all the children
Lured 'em into the building and killed 'em
Buried 'em in the mulch and mildew and he will do what he feels
And still can spin, straw to gold like Rumplestilskin
Cotton to silk, Motrin to Tylenol 3 pills
The Real Slim Shady's entered the buildin'
There's nothing but crumbled leaves and tumbleweeds up in this bitch
Mildred, he's ill with it, he still shouldn't be healed
There's no one as sick as he, MC's will get fricassed on the grill, thenDo to a massive amount of bootlegging
And constant downloading
People are no longer buying CDs so that we can get paid for our fucking work
They are just continuing to get songs for free
See, what they do is buy computers, strictly pick songs that they like
And burn them on CDs or put them on iPods
Causing major decrease in sound scan, putting music retail in a tremendous slump
Causing artists such as myself to make no money for record sales
Being forced to tour, causing more stress, more arguments with my wife
Not being able to see my kids, drink more, take more pills
Punch more people in the face, hate the world, and end up in rehab
(sigh) This has been a Public Service Announcement and an excuse to vent by Marshall Mathers
Not that I wouldn't have done the same thing if I could get music for free when I was a kid
But now that I rap for a living, buy my goddamn CDs!
But in the meantime, buy this Obie Trice bootleg from DJ Whoo Kid
And put more money in his pocket

Yeah
I know sometimes, things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey, what'd Daddy always tell you?
Straighten up little soldier - stiffen up that upper lip
What you cryin' about? You got me

Hailie I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad
When I'm gone but I'm tryin to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry
Cause you're scared, I ain't there, Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more cryin, wipe them tears, Daddy's here no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Lainie, Uncle's crazy, ain't he? yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it
We're all we got in this world, when it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls
Lookin puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin you
Daddy's always on the move, Momma's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that the more it backfires on me
All the things growin up as Daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever being
Together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then of course everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just somethin we have no control over and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream

Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold, ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, Momma's gon' be alright

Heh, it's funny
I remember back one year when daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree
And said some of 'em were from me, cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night cryin'
Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
And at the time, every house that we lived in
Either kept gettin broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
And your mom, was savin money for you in a jar
Tryin to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars, 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin to fall apart
Mom and Dad was arguin a lot so momma moved back
On the Chalmers in the flat, one bedroom apartment
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre, and flew you and Momma out to see me
But Daddy had to work, you and Momma had to leave me
Then you started seeing Daddy on the TV
And Momma didn't like it, and you and Lainey were too young to understand it
Papa was a rollin stone, momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house, just reminiscing
Looking at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here
Lainie I'm talking to you too, Daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it don't it?
Sssshhh, Momma's only gone for the moment


And if you ask me to Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'mma give you the world
I'mma buy a diamond ring for you, I'mma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'ma break that birdie's neck
I'd go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every karat, don't fuck with Dad
Ha ha!Ouais, je sais que parfois
Les choses peuvent sembler, ne pas avoir de sens pour toi maintenant
Mais! Qu'est ce que papa t'as toujours dit? Tiens toi droit petit soldat
Ne laisse pas ta lèvre supérieur trembler...Pourquoi tu pleures? Tu m'as moi

Hailie je sais que ta maman te manque, et je sais que ton papa te manque quand je pars
Mais j'essaie de t'offrir la vie que je n'ai jamais eu
Je sais que t'es triste, même quand tu souris,même lorsque tu ris
Je peux le voir dans tes yeux, au fond tu as envie de pleurer
Car tu as peur n'est ce pas? Papa est avec toi dans tes prières
Plus de pleurs, sèche tes larmes, papa est là, plus de cauchemars
Nous les surpasserons tout les deux,nous le ferons ensemble!
Laney, tonton est fou,oui, mais il t'aime et fera tout pour que tu le saches
Tout ce qu'on a c'est nous,quand ça vrille, quand ça tourbillonne
Quand ça tournois ou que tout devient flou
Deux magnifiques petites filles,elles ont l'air confuses et étourdies
Je sais que tout ça t'embrouille
Papa n'est jamais là, maman est toujours dans les journaux
J'essaie de te mettre à l'abris de tout ces soucis pour te protéger
Mais j'ai l'impression que quelle que soit la manière
J'ai beau essayé, ça se retourne contre moi
Toutes les choses prenant sans cesse de l'ampleur que papa a été forcé de voir
Papa voulait pas que tu les voies mais tu les as vu autant que moi
Nous n'avions pas prévus tout ça,ta mère et moi
Mais les choses se sont si mal passées entre nous,je ne nous vois plus ensemble
Comme nous l'étions lors de notre adolescence, mais aussi bien sur
Tout se passe toujours pour une certaine raison
J'imagine que ça n'aurait jamais du avoir lieu
Mais c'est seulement quelque chose sur quoi nous n'avons aucun contrôle
C'est le destin, Mais n'ai plus peur, repose ta tête et va dormir
Peut etre qu'un jour nous nous réveillerons et cela n'aura été qu'un simple rêve


Maintenant calme toi petit bébé, ne pleure pas, Tout se passera bien
Ne laisse pas ta lèvre supérieur trembler, petite dame
Papa est là pour te porter à travers la nuit
Je sais que maman n'est pas là en ce moment et nous se savons pas pourquoi
Nous avons peur de nos sentiments, ça peut paraître un peu fou, jolie bébé
Mais je te promet, maman se remettra

C'est bizarre...Je me souvient d'une année ou papa n'avait pas d'argent
Maman avait emballé les cadeaux de noël et les avait mis sous le sapin
Et avait dit que certains d'entre eux étaient de ma part
Papa ne pouvait pas les acheter
J'oublierai jamais ce noël,je suis resté assis toute la soirée a pleurer
Papa se sentait comme un clochard
Vois tu , le travail de papa était de faire en sorte que la nourriture
Ne disparaissent pas de la table pour toi et maman
Parce qu’a l'époque
Toutes les maisons dans lesquelles nous avons vécues étaient soit
Cambriolées et brûlées, soit endommagées par les balles sifflantes du ghetto
Et ta maman économisait de l'argent dans un vase afin d'établir une tirelire
Rien que pour toi, pour que tu puisses aller a l'université
Elle avait presque récolté 1000$, jusqu’à quand quelqu'un nous cambriole
Et ça blesse profondément à quel point ça a brisé le coeur de ta maman
Tout commença a s’effondrer à partir de ce moment là
Maman et papa se disputaient beaucoup alors maman déménagea dans le Chalmers
Pour un triste appartement avec une seul chambre
Et papa alla s'installé de l'autre coté de 8mile a Novarra
Et tout ça s'est passé quand papa est allé en Californie avec son CD pour rencontrer Dr Dre
Et vous fis venir maman et toi pour me voir, Mais papa devait travailler
Toi et maman deviez me laisser, puis t'as commencé a voir Papa a la télé
Et Maman n'a pas aimé,Laney et toi étaient trop jeunes pour comprendre
Papa été sans cesse sur la route,Maman pris la même habitude
Et tout s'est passé trop vite pour que nous puissions nous ressaisir
Et tu était là a ce moment et je regrette simplement que tu ais connu tout ça
Car tout ce que j'ai toujours voulu c'était te rendre fière
Maintenant je me promène dans cette maison vide,me remémorant des souvenirs
En regardant des photos de maman et toi, votre ressemblance m'a juste ébahi
On dirait que c'est ta soeur désormais,wouah, je suppose que vous devez être belles
Et papa est toujours là,Laney j'te parle à toi aussi,Papa est toujours là
J'aime le son de cette phrase, il y a de la délicatesse dedans..
Chut, maman est partie pour un moment

Maintenant calme toi petit bébé, ne pleure pas, Tout se passera bien
Ne laisse pas ta lèvre supérieur trembler, petite dame
Papa est là pour te porter à travers la nuit
Je sais que maman n'est pas là en ce moment et nous se savons pas pourquoi
Nous avons peur de nos sentiments, ça peut paraître un peu fou, jolie bébé
Mais je te promet, maman se remettra
Et si tu me le demandes, papa t'achèteras un moqueur
Je te donnerai le monde, J’achèterai une bague en diamant rien que pour toi
Je chanterai pour toi, je ferais n'importe quoi pour te voir sourie
Et si je moqueur ne chante pas et que la bague ne brille pas
Je briserai la nuque de cet oiseau, je retournerai chez le bijoutier qui te l'avais vendu
Et lui ferait manger chaque carat jusqu'au dernier...
Ne plaisantez pas avec papa[Intro]
Ayo 50
What I tell you?
We ain't even have to say shit
They did it

Monkey see, monkey do
Don't ever make the first move
Just let 'em come to you
Cause they gon always see and do
What the other one do
So let them come to you
The rest'll just follow suit
Monkey see, monkey do
Tweedle-dee, tweedle-dum
If they really want it bad enough
Well then they gunna come
Now here they come
As we expected
Now we just set 'em up
Check-mate motherfucker
Games over, we won
Tweedle-dee, tweedle-dum

Doesn't take much
For me to raise such a stink up
When motherfuckers hate your guts
You ain't even got to say much
For me to put a pen to a blank sheet of paper
S'like smearing a bloodstain with a paint brush
I can’t explain what it is my brain does
But however it works
It's insane, its plain nuts
And it ain't just my brain that’s dangerous
It’s a whole combination of things
It takes nuts
And I’m not afraid to raise the stakes up
I got a million bucks in the bank
And 8 trucks
For anybody who gets on the track and spanks us
I'm patiently waiting for the day
I’m anxious
To see the look on ya fake mugs
When you thugs go bankrupt
Ya drunk
You ain't tough
Whatever you drank must of just
Turned you into some gangstas
This is me talking motherfucker
This ain’t drugs
You wanna pop shit?
Wake-up
Then make-up
FUCK THAT
It’s too late chump now
Face up
I pray for the day
That someone who spits with the caliber
That Nas and Jay does
Opens up his jaw to say somethin'
Or rattle my name off
Or rattle the first thing
From the top of his brain off
So I can blow the fucking dust off of this chainsaw
And give him the surgery that he came for
'Til I pull the paint off
I never been shot
But I think me and Fifty must of been cut
From the same cloth
Cos I’ve always came off like Ja's chain
When they try to rush him and lost
And came back
And gave him a watch in exchange for it
I don’t stop
The only thing that I wait for
Is the day I don’t have to report to probate court
Cos im'ma give ya' all a reason to hate more
Cos I been holding my tongue 'til I got a sprained jaw
Alot of rappers on my list
That just ain’t Ja
And im'ma read that motherfucker off come April
You pussies think I went soft since 8 mile
When I come back I’ll be shooting more than paintballs
Trust me


Fucking dummies
This ain’t chess
You playin' motherfucking checkers
This shit is all day man it’s too easy
We playing chess you playing checkers
You 'bout to get your mother fucking asses jumped
Fucking punks
And by the way
We ain’t just talking to one person
We talking to every motherfucking body who wants to bring it
Cos we bring it into anybody who wants to bring it
So bring it
Don’t pick up the ball if you don’t wanna play man
It’s all fucked up now
The fuck I’m suppose to do now
Huh?
The fuck I'm suppose to do
Yo we out[Intro: Kids' voices]
I pledge allegiance, to the flag, of the United States of America
And to the republic, for which it stands
.. one nation, under God, indivisible
.. with liberty and justice for all

Mosh with me now
Scrutinize every word, memorize every line
I spit it once, refuel, re-energize, and rewind
I give sight to the blind, my insight through the mind
I exercise my right to express when I feel it's time
It's just all in your mind, what you interpret it as
I say to fight and you take it as "I'mma whip someone's ass"
If you don't understand, don't even bother to ask
A father who has, grown up with a fatherless past
Who has blown up now, to rap phenomenon that has
Or at least shows no difficulty multi-taskin
And juggling both, perhaps mastered his craft slash
Entrepreneur, who's helped launch a few more rap acts
Who's had a few obstacles thrown his way through the last half
Of his career typical manure movin past that
Mr. Kiss-His-Ass-Crack, he's a class act
Rubberband man yeah, he just snaps back

Come along, follow me, as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need
To proceed, carry on, give me hope
Give me strength, come with me, and I won't steer you wrong
Put your faith, and your trust, as I guide us through the fog
To the light, at the end, of the tunnel we gon' fight
We gon' charge, we gon' stomp, we gon' march through the swamp
We gon' mosh through the marsh, take us right through the doors
C'mon

All the people up top, on the side and the middle
Come together let's all form, and swarm just a little
Just let it gradually build, from the front to the back
All you can see is a sea of people some white and some black
Don't matter what color all that matters we're gathered together
To celebrate for the same cause no matter the weather
If it rains, let it rain, yeah the wetter the better
They ain't gon' stop us they can't, we're stronger now more than ever
They tell us no we say yeah, they tell us stop we say go
Rebel with a rebel yell, raise hell, we gon' let 'em know
Stomp, push shove, mush, fuck Bush
Until they bring our troops home c'mon, just


Imagine it pouring, just raining down on us
Mosh pits outside the Oval Office, someone's trying
To tell us something maybe this is God just
Saying we're responsible, for this monster
This coward that we have empowered, this is Bin Laden
Look at his head nodding - how could, we allow
Something like this without, pumping our fist now
This is our, final hour
Let me, be the voice, and your strength, and your choice
Let me simplify the rhyme just to amplify the noise
Try to amplify it, times-it, and multiply it by six-teen
Million people all equal at this high pitch
Maybe we can reach al-Qaeda through my speech
Let the President answer a higher anarchy
Strap him with an AK-47, let him go
Fight his own war, let him impress daddy that way
No more blood for oil, we got our own battles
To fight on our own soil, no more psychological warfare
To trick us to thinking we ain't loyal
If we don't serve our own country we're patronizing a hero
Look in his eyes it's all lies
The stars and stripes have been swiped, washed out and wiped
And replaced with his own face, mosh now or die
If I get sniped tonight, you'll know why - cause I told you to fight!


And as we procede, to mosh through this Desert Storm
And these closing statements, if they should argue
Let us beg to differ
As we set aside our differences, and assemble our own army
To disarm, THIS weapon of mass destruction
That we call our President, for the present
And mosh for the future of our next generation
To speak, and be heard
Mr. President! Mr. Senator!

"Go left, go left, go left right left"
"Go left, go left, go left right left"

Can you guys hear us? *laughs*[Male Medic]
Mr. Mathers?
Mr. Mathers!
Mr. Mathers...
Mr. Mathers, can you hear my voice?
Okay, he's not responding
I'm gonna need an 18 gauge, left AC, right away

Uh, BP is 90 over palp, respiration's at 8
OK, I'm tubing him

DMC, this is medic 41

Medic 41, this is DMC base, go ahead

He's cold, spike a bag and grab the backboard

OK, got it; on 3... 1, 2
Let's move[Hook]
All I see is murder-murder, my mindstate
Makes it too late for cops to try and stop the crime rate
All I see is murder-murder, my mindstate
Murder-murder-murder and kill-kill-kill

Left the keys in the van, with a gat in each hand
Went up in Eastland and shot a policeman
Fuck a peace plan, if a citizen bystands
The shit is in my hands, here's your lifespan
And for what your life's worth, this money is twice than
Grab a couple grand and lay up in Iceland
See I'm a nice man but money turned me to Satan
I'm thirsty for this green so bad I'm dehydrating
Hurry up with the cash bitch, I got a ride waiting
Shot a man twice in the back when he tried escaping
I want the whole pie, I won't be denied Nathan
Maybe I need my head inside straightened, brain contemplating
Clean out the register, dip before somebody catches ya
Or gets your description and sketches ya
Then connects you as the prime suspect
But I ain't set to flee the scene of the crime just yet
Cause I got a daughter to feed
And two hundred dollars ain't enough to water the seed
The best thing would be for me to leave Taco Bell
And hit up Chess King and have the lady at the desk bring
Money from the safe in the back, stepped in waving the Mac
Co-operate, and we can operate, and save an attack
This bitch tried escaping the jack, grabbed her by the throat
It's murder she wrote, you barely heard a word
As she choked, it wasn't nothing for her to be smoked
Then I slammed her on her back 'til her vertebrae broke
Just then the pigs bust in yelling: "Freeze!"
But I'm already wanted for selling ki's
And bunch of other felonies from A to Z like spelling bees
So before I dropped to the ground and fell on knees
I bust shots, they bust back
Hit me square in the chest, wasn't wearing a vest

All I see is murder-murder, my mindstate
Makes it too late for cops to try and stop the crime rate
All I see is murder-murder, my mindstate
Murder-murder-murder and kill-kill-kill

Left the house, pulling out the drive backing out
Blew the back end out this lady's Jag, started blacking out
Pulled the Mac-10 out, stuck it in her face:
"Shut your yacking mouth
'Fore I blow the brain from out the back ya scalp!"
Drug her by her hair, smacked her up
Thinking fuck it, mug her while you're there, jacked her up
Stole her car and made a profit, grabbed the tape from out the deck
And lost it out the window like the girl in Set It Off did
Jetted off kid, stole the whip, now I'm a criminal
Drove it through somebody's yard, dove into they swimming pool
Climbed out and collapsed on the patio
I made it out alive but I'm injured badly though
Parents screaming, "Johnny go in and call the police
Tell em there's a crazy man disturbing all of the peace"
Tried to stall him at least long enough to let me leap up
Run in they crib and at least leave with some little cheap stuff
Acting like they never seen nobody hit a lick before
Smashed the window, grabbed the Nintendo 64
When they sell out in stores the price triples
I ran up the block jumping kids on tricycles
And collided with an 80-year-old lady with groceries
There goes cheese, eggs, milk and Post Toasties
Stood up and started to see stars
Too many siren sounds, it seemed like a thousand police cars
Barely escaped, must'a been some dumb luck
Jumped up and climbed the back of a moving dump truck
But I think somebody seen me maybe
Plus I lost the damn Nintendo and I must'a dropped a Beanie Baby
Fuck it I give up, I'm surrounded in blue suits
Came out with a white flag hollering "truce-truce"
And surrendered my weapon to cops
Wasn't me, it was the gangster rap and the peppermint Schnapps

All I see is murder-murder, my mindstate
Makes it too late for cops to try and stop the crime rate
All I see is murder-murder, my mindstate
Murder-murder-murder and kill-kill-kill[Hook] (repeat 4X)
It's murder she wrote (it's murder she wrote)
It wasn't nuttin for her to be smoked (for her to be smoked)

Left the keys in the van, with a gat in each hand
Went up in Eastland and shot a policeman
Fuck a peace plan, if a citizen bystands
The shit is in my hands, here's yo' lifespan
And for what yo' life's worth, this money is twice than
Grab a couple grand and lamp in Iceland
See I'm a nice man but money turned me to Satan
I'm thirsty for this green so bad I'm dehydratin
Hurry up with the cash bitch, I got a ride waitin
Shot a man twice in the back when he tried skatin
I want the whole pie, I won't be denied nathan
Maybe I need my head inside straightened
Brain contemplatin, clean out the register
Dip before somebody catches ya
Or gets your description and sketches ya
The connection was the prime suspect
But I ain't set to flee the scene of the crime just yet
Cause I got a daughter to feed
And $200 ain't enough to water the seed
The best thing would be for me to leave Taco Bell and hit up Chess King
And have the lady at the desk bring
Money from the safe in the back, stepped in wavin the Mac
Cooperate, and we can operate, and save an attack
This bitch tried escapin the jack
Grabbed her by the throat, it's murder she wrote
You barely heard a word as she choked
It wasn't nuttin for her to be smoked
But I slammed her on her back til her vertebrae broke
Just then the pigs bust in yellin "Freeze"
But I'm already wanted for sellin ki's
And bunch of other felonies from A to Z like spellin bees
So before I dropped to the ground and fell on knees
I bust shots, they bust back
Hit be square in the chest, wasn't wearin a vest
Left the house, pullin out the drive backin out
Blew the back end out this lady's Jag, started blackin out
Pulled the Mac-10 out, stuck it in her face
Shut your yackin mouth, 'fore I blow the brain from out the back ya scalp
Drug her by her hair, smacked her up
Thinkin fuck it, mug her while you're there, jacked her up
Stole her car, made a profit
Grabbed the tape from out the deck and offed it out the window
Like the girl in "Set It Off" did
Jetted off kid, stole the whip, now I'm a criminal
Drove it through somebody's yard, dove into they swimmin pool
Climbed out and collapsed on the patio
I made it out alive but I'm injured badly though
Parents screamin: "Son, go in and call the police
Tell em there's a crazy man disturbing all of the peace!"
Tried to stall him at least long enough to let me leap up
Run in they crib and at least leave with some little cheap stuff
Actin like they never seen nobody hit a lick before
Smashed the window, grabbed the Nintendo 64
When they sell out in stores the price triples
I ran up the block jumpin kids on tricycles
And collided with an 80-year old lady with groceries
There goes cheese, eggs, milk and Post Toasties
Stood up and started to see stars
Too many siren sounds, it seemed like a thousand police cars
Barely escaped, must-a been some dumb luck
Jumped up and climbed the back of a movin dump truck
But I think somebody seen me maybe
Plus I lost the damn Nintendo and I musta dropped the Beanie Baby
Fuck it I give up, I'm surrounded in blue suits
Came out with a white flag hollerin "TRUCE TRUCE"
And surrendered my weapon to cops
Wasn't me! It was the gangster rap and the peppermint Schnapps

(repeats again to fade)[Produced by Dawaun Parker and Dr. Dre]

Yeah, yeah girl
Can you hear that, it's playing our song
Are you sleepy, take a nap
You're not afraid of the dark are ya

You hear the beat, as it makes ya not want to go to sleep
I knock on Dakota's door, it's locked so I go to creep
Round the back with binoculars, not cause I want to peep
But because I'm hungry, she smells like tacos, I wanna eat
Visions of hot chocolatey marshmallows, all so sweet
With sugar plums, oh look here comes Marshall, he's on your street
He's placin' hot smolderin' charcoals beneath your feet
Now walk on 'em, he's dancin' with carcasses cheek to cheek
Like a Thanksgiving turkey, a holiday ham
Cinnamon sprinkled on toast, strawberry marmalade jam
Flavor my favorite graham crackers with Jon Benet Rams
I guess a modern day Jack the Ripper is all that I am

Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep (My music box)
But I can hear you my love, you keep callin' me (My music box)
And when we're worlds apart, you mean the World to me (My music box)
If you call, I'll come, I will answer (My music box)
Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl’s asleep (My music box)
I hear my music box, playing a song for me (My music box)
So won’t you twirl around, and do a whirl for me (My music box)
And will you be my private little dancer? (My music box)

I almost look comatose, who wants to be sober? gross
I foam like a doberman, mouth open, I overdose
Put coke up my nostrils, in both my holes then I plug my nose
My pupils quadruple in size, eyes are so bugged I know
I put on my mother's makeup, get naked and run around
Wavin' the gun around, I think I'm down to a hundred pounds
There's thunder, I wonder how come it rains, but the sun is out
The Devil's upset with his wife, they must be sluggin' it out
I must be buggin' the fuck out, but what the fuck about
Voices are leading me up to the attic, I love my house
They pull and they tug my blouse, the sound of a music box
Comes from inside a toy chest, but what do I do it's locked
I pick it and open it, but it's stuffed full of human parts
I dig 'till I find it, I wind it up, and the tune it starts
It's playin' a song so beautiful and the room is dark
The moon is full, I smell a funeral, guess I'll loom in the park


I'm fixated, on asphyxiating
And breaking this little chick's neck, like a pixie stick
The sick, satan worshippin', bitches get horse whippins'
I'm in the back, through the back door slippin'
Through the crack, leavin' the corpse drippin'
The mortician of love, sent from above
Forced entry to maul when she no more stingy I've become
Been doin' this for more than a quarter century, I'm just numb
Am I dreamin', is it real? someone pinch me on the buns
The time has come, to tie her up
Gotta roll me the ladder, I've had enough of the chatter
Climb up to the window look at her
Then climb in slow to shatter, her brain matter and batter her
With a bat a matter of fact that will splatter her
But before I do that, I'll have a chat to flatter her
Give her two compliments back to back like Tabitha
I'm your secret admirer, I'm back to ravish ya
So strong is your fight, but you're no match for Dracula
Prolonging her plight, as I go back to stabbin' her
Dismember her limbs, simple as that, cadaver her
Zoom in with the lens, then pan back the camera
Stand back cause here comes your man, Jack, so Pamela

I feel like dancing, I feel like dancing
I smell something in the air that's making me high!
I said, I smell something in the air that's making me high!

Ok, here we go, Do-re-mi-fa-so-fa-so-la-ti so
Lyrical rascal, kick back the Tabasco
You motherfucker's must just not know the tick-tock, so
Time to show you the most kick-ass flow in the cosmos
Picasso with a pick axe, a sick asshole
Tic-tac-toe comes with 6-pack, with Exacto
Knives, strangling wives with thick lasso
3 bags of the grass, Zig Zags. I'm with the Doc, so
You know how that go, skull and the crossbones
This is poison to boys and girls who do not know
You do not want to try this at home, my lil vato
This is neither the time nor the place to get macho
So crack a 6-pack, sit back with some nachos
Maybe some popcorn, watch the show and just rock slow
It's not what you expected, not what you thought so
Bout time that you wake the fuck up, smell the pot smoke

It must be the Ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creeping upon me, why I'm so high
Maybe it's the Henny, that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me, I don't mind

Your dreams are getting fulfilled oh, I'm literally getting a chill
Spitting at will, me and Dre have just finished splitting a pill
You're submitting to skill, sitting still
I'm admitting I'm beginning to feel like I don't think anyone's real
Faced with a dilemma, I can be Dalai Lama and be calmer
Bring drama a step beyond a Jeffrey Dahmer
Please don't upset me mama, you're looking sexy mama
Don't know if it's the lala, or the rum and Pepsi mama
Don't wanna end up inside my refrigerator freezer
Be used as extra topping then next time I make a pizza
How many people you know that can name every serial killer
Who ever existed in a row, put them in chronological order
Beginning with Jack the Ripper
Name the time and place from the body, the bag, the zipper
Location of the woods where the body was dragged and then dumped
The trunk that they was stuffed in, the model, the make, the plate
And which model, which lake they found her
And how they attacked the victim
Say what murder weapon was used to do what on which one
Which knife and which gun, what kid, what wife and which nun
Don't stop, I like this it's fun, the fucking night's just begun


When I'm behind the mic, dynamite's what it's kinda like
You're stuck with the same stick that you're trying to light
Behind the boards, it's Dre, legends are made this way
Isn't it safe to say, this is the way it should be?
Maybe you need some lyric syrup serum for your symptoms
Here's a dosage of the antidote, now you give him some
He can give her some, she can give them some
Get behind a LinnDrum, make up a beat and kill the sucker syndrome
The spinning drum when it comes to lyrics and penning some
Starting from scratch and then ending up at the ending of
Capable of winning a Pulitzer, so unbelievable, it's a
Titanium cranium that's full of surprises
When the smoke rises, right before your very own eyes
You stare into your stereos (high)
Good evening, this isn't even a weed thing
I ain't even smoke anything, I ain't even drinking

Ohhhhhh! Yeah!
So much for first single on this one

Shady's the label, Aftermath is the stable {*neighing*}
That the horses come out of {erra} of course we're about to {stir} up
Some shit thick as Ms. Buttersworth's {syrup}
It's the Mr. Picked-on-Christopher-Reeves just for no reason
Other than just to tease him, cause he was his biggest {*belch*} fan
He used to be Superman
Now we're pourin' liquor, on the curb in his, name for him
"Eminem you wait 'til we meet up again, fucker
I'm kickin' your ass for everything you've ever, said"
It goes one for the money two for the fuckin' show, ready, get set let's go
Here comes the buckin' bronco
Stompin' and stampedin' up the damn street like them buffalo soldiers
I told ya I'm bout to blow, so look out below, Geronimo
Motherfuckers is dominoes, I'm on a roll
Around and around I go - when will I stop? I don't know
Tryin to pick up where The Eminem Show left off
But I know anything's possible, though I'm not gonna top what I sold
I'm at the top of my game, that shit is not gonna change
Long as I got Dr. Dre on my team I'll get away with murder
I'm like O.J., he's like my Cochran today
We keep the Mark Fuhrman tapes, in a safe, locked them away {*slam*}
Better watch what you say, just when you thought you were safe
Them fuckers got you on tape, you swear to God you was playin'
Whether or not you was little Joshua, gosh I wish I could've told ya
To not do the same, cause one day it could cost you your name

And this was supposed to be my first single (Burp)
But I just fucked that off so
Fuck it let's all have fun let's mingle (Burp)
Slap a bitch and smack a ho
This was supposed to be my catchy little jingle (Fart)
That you hear on your radio
But shit's about to hit the shingle (Fart)
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-no {erra}
Oh, ah {erra} oh, ah
{erra} Oh, ah {erra} oh oh ah ah
Oh, ah {erra} oh, ah
{erra} Oh, ah {erra} poo poo ca ca

Eri-Eri-Erick swallowed some generic sleeping pills
And woke up in bed next to his best friend Derrick bare naked
{chiga chigga Jigga jigga} Janean just turned 16 and used a fake ID
To sneak in V.I.P. to see R. Kelly - he he he he he he
To be so young and naive
Oh what I wouldn't give to live so Kim and carefree
Paris and Nicky's parents must be so tickled they cherish every picture
With their kids with hickeys all over their necks
Hickory dickory {Dirk Diggler} look at me {work} wizardry
With these words - am I a jerk or just jerk chicken?
Or {chiga chigga chig chig jer chig jer} jerkin' the chain
22 jerks in a jerk circle, or is it a circle jerk?
Wait a minute, what am I sayin? Allow me to run it back
And rewind it {blblblblblblblb well} let me ask you again
Am I just jerkin your chain, am I berserk or insane?
Or am I just one of them damn amateurs workin the damn camera
Filmin' one of them Paris Hilton homemade pornos
Who keeps tiltin' the lens at an angle {chigga chigga}
Just recently somebody just discovered
Britney and Justin videotapes of them fuckin
When they were just Mouseketeers in the Mickey Mouse Club and dusted 'em
And went straight to The Source with them
Cause they could've sworn someone said
Nuh - and then tried to erase and record over it
But if you listen close enough to it you can hear the
Uhh, uhh, and then they come-to
Find out it, was-Justin sayin' "I'm go-nna cum!"


Any opinions or somethin' you just wanna get off your chest
And address it about my lyrics I'd love to hear it
All you gotta do is pick up the phone and just dial up this number
It's 1-800-I'm-A-Dick-Sucker, I love to suck a dick
And if someone picks up you can talk all the shit you want about me
Just type in your number back and follow it by the pound key
And I'll be sure to get back as soon as there comes a day
That I fall out with Dre, wake up gay, and make up with Ray (hey!)
So fuck a chicken, lick a chicken, suck a chicken, beat a chicken
Eat a chicken like it's a big cock, ba-ca-BA-KAWK!
Or suck a dick, and lick a dick, and eat a dick, and stick a dick
In your mouth, I'm done you can fuck off, fucka-FUCK-OFF!


{*burps*}[Intro - Television show]
Hello boys and girls!
Today we're gonna talk about father and daughter relationships
Do you have a daddy? I'll bet you do!
Who's your daddy?


There's no mountain I can't climb, there's no tower too high
No plane that I can't learn how to fly
What do I gotta do to get through to you
To show you there ain't nothing I can't take this chainsaw to
I cut em off and got em pickled and bronzed in a glass jar
Inside of a hall with my framed autographed sunglasses
With Elton John's name on my drag wall
I'm out the closet, I've been lying my ass off
All this time me and Dre been fucking with hats off
(Suck it Marshall!) So tell Laura and her husband to back off
'fore I push this motherfuckin' button and blast off
And launch one at these Russians and that's all
Blow every fucking thing except Afghanistan on the map off
When will it stop? When will I knock the crap off?
{*knocking*} Hailie, tell em baby - (My dad's lost it!)

There's really nothing else to say, I - I can't explain it
(I think my dad's gone crazy!)
A little help from Hailie Jade, won't you tell em baby
(I think my dad's gone crazy!)
There's nothing you could do or say that could ever change me
(I think my dad's gone crazy!)
There's no one on earth that can save me, not even Hailie
(I think my dad's gone crazy!)

It's like my mother always told me
Rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana and Codeine
And God dammit you little motherfucker
If you ain't got nothing nice to say then don't say nothing
... Uh ... fuck that shit, bitch!
Eat a motherfucking dick, chew on a prick
And lick a million motherfucking cocks per second
I'd rather put out a motherfucking gospel record
I'd rather be a pussy-whipped bitch, eat pussy
And have pussy lips glued to my face with a clit ring
In my nose than quit bringing my flows
Quit giving me my ammo; can't you see why I'm so mean?
If y'all leave me alone this wouldn't be my M.O
I wouldn't have to go eenee-meene-minie-moe
Catch a homo by his toe, man I don't know no more
Am I the only fuckin' one who's normal any more? (Dad!)


My songs can make you cry, take you by surprise
At the same time, can make you dry your eyes
With the same rhyme; see, what you're seeing is a genius at work
Which to me isn't work
So it's easy to misinterpret it at first
Cause when I speak, it's tongue-in-cheek
I'd yank my fuckin' teeth
Before I'd ever bite my tongue, I'd slice my gums
Get struck by fuckin' lightning twice at once
And die and come back as Vanilla Ice's son
And walk around the rest of my life spit on
And kicked and hit with shit every time I sung
Like R. Kelly as soon as "Bump and Grind" comes on
More pain inside of my brain than the eyes of a little girl
Inside of a plane, aimed at the World Trade
Standing on Ronnie's grave, screaming at the sky
'til clouds gather it's Clyde Mathers and Bonnie Jade
And that's pretty much the gist of it
The parents are pissed but the kids love it
9 millimeter heaters stashed in 2-seaters with meat cleavers
I don't blame you, I wouldn't let Hailie listen to me neither


Ha ha ha ha!
You're funny daddy![Verse 1]
If I woulda rap about the crap that's out, that's the route
You probably want me to take cause you're just dying to know what I think
Hear my take on some other rappers
If I was to say somethin about Paul Wall, you'd probably crap in your pants
Cause I'm White and he's White, so he's like my competition I mean, right
Nope, Paul Wall is dope, and so is Bubba, so b-b-b-b-b-b
But I don't compete with nobody
I just go hard, do the rope-a-dope Ali shuffle
And dance around my opponents, do donuts
Sometimes I play possum, like I'm asleep, it's awesome
I'm like a sleepin giant and when I awake I'm like Dre
I just jump from outta nowhere and bite prey
And sink my teeth in em and fill em, full of poison
And make a noise like a snake before I kill em
And let em know that I just don't feel em
And smack 'em with the backwards E on the Eminem emblem
I was taught if you gonna murder somebody you should face 'em
Tell 'em why, look 'em dead in the eye, then waste 'em
And the dark shall emerge from the fiery depths of hell
Then swallow the shell, all the hollow who dwell
In the shadows of all who are willing to sell their souls
For this rap game and it g-g-goes
One-two-three, chk-chk one-two-three
Chk-chk one-two-three, that ain't the hook, now follow me
There's nothing else for me to say, my public adores me
Everybody bores me, they're just so corny
So at night before I sleep, I look in the mirror
The mirror grows lips and it whispers "Come nearer"

My darling, I don't ever want you to leave me, my darling
You and me were meant to be together my darling
And if I cannot have you no one can, you're my darling
Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body
I don't ever want you to leave me, my darling
You and me were meant to be together my darling
And if I cannot have you no one can, you're my darling
Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body

"Shady, I know you're in there somewhere, come here
Talk to me, sit, here, pull up a chair
Why don't you cut your hair? Dye it back, come on, try it"
Ahh, no! I told you leave me the fuck alone, will you?
"But I'm here to rebuild you" But I already killed you!
"But Shady, we were meant for each other, think about your mother"
Yeah, so what of her?
"You think about what she did to you and your little brother
All them foster homes" Fuck you mothafucka!
I had you beat! "No, I was playin possum, remember?
I let you watch your little girls blossom
I gave you enough time, your soul's mine
I'm takin it back" You fuckin bitch, why?!
"Because I love you, look a little closer
Isn't that us on that poster?"


"Shady, listen (Shady!) You hear that?
They're screaming for you, I can bring your career back"
But I don't want it back "Yes, you do" No I don't
"Yes, you do, you're gonna regret it later" No I won't
"I'ma get Dre on the phone, I'll just call the Doctor"
Go ahead, I already talked to Dre yesterday
"Well I got him on the phone right now"
(Slim) You're lying! (Yo, Slim) How, why now?
What up Dre? (Check this out Slim, I gotta talk to you
I don't know, it just seems like ever since you got off your
Drugs you became a lot softer)
But Dre, all Shady is a bottle of hair bleach and vodka
(Well, just think about it Slim, I'm here
Just hit me back and let me know what's up) Fuck this mirror!
"I'm not in the mirror, I'm inside you, let me guide you"
Fuck you, die you son of a bitch "Put the gun down"
Bye-bye! Okay, I'm still alive "So am I too!
You can't kill a spirit even if you tried to
Ha ha, you sold your soul to me, need I remind you?
You remember that night you prayed to God
You'd give anything to get a record deal, well Dre signed you
This is what you wanted your whole life Marshall, right? Ooh
Look at this house, look at these cars, they're so nice, woo!
Oh, but you didn't know fame has a price too?
That you just now seeing the downside too
Lose your best friend from high school, your wife too
Ain't even sure if your kids like you
Come off tour, can't even sleep at night without NyQuil
Become a Valium addict, start a rehab cycle
But together we can break the cycle, Marshall"
What?! "No one's gonna love you like I do"


It's either you have a problem and can you control it or you can't, I literally thought I could control it until I overdosed during Christmas of 2007. Had I got to the hospital about two hours later, I would have died. My organs were shutting down. My liver, kidneys, everything. They were gonna have to put me on dialysis, they didn’t think I was gonna make it.

I remember coming out of rehab and relapsing and shooting right back up to where I was when I overdosed. I was ransacking my whole house just looking for a stash of Vicodin that I maybe hidden away and then I found some in my basement wrapped up it was the extra strength ones.

After I got out of rehab I did not sleep for three week straights I mean like not even nodding off for a fucking minute I would just sit up and stare at my TV.

I would walk around my house and thinking every single day, "I'm gonna fucking die." I'm looking at my kids, and like, I need to be here for them. I'm growing. I just couldn’t believe that anybody could be naturally happy or naturally function or be just enjoying life in general without being on something

The doctors told me I'd done the equivalent of four bags of heroin,
I was addicted Valium, Ambien, the numbers got so high I didn't even know what I was taking anymore. It never once hit me that drug addiction runs in my family, now that I understand that I’m an addict, I definitely have compassion for my mother. I get it now.

I wanted to make an overall statement — I’m back. It was a slow process. You gotta remember I hadn’t recorded a song sober in seven years. So it took me awhile to even feel like I could record a song sober … I don’t know the last time I shot a video sober, without drinking or taking anything. It’s been years.

I almost feel like a little kid again with rap, I wanna play around with different flows. If I don’t feel like it’s what I’m fully capable of, if there’s one weak line, I wanna change it. Rap was my drug It used to get me high and then it stopped getting me high. Then I had to resort to other things to make me feel that. Now rap’s getting me high again.

So I would say to anybody, it does get better, you know. It just does.*Key*

I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
Now you sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault my fault

I went to John's rave with Ron and Dave
And met a new wave blonde babe with half of her head shaved
A nurse aid who came to get laid and tied up
With first aid tape and raped on the first date
Susan -- an ex-heroin addict who just stopped using
Who love booze and alternative music (Whattup)
Told me she was going back into using again (Nah)
I said, "Wait, first try this hallucinogen
It's better than heroin, Henn, the booze or the gin
C'mere, let's go in here" "Who's in the den?"
"My bad, (sorry) let's try another room"
"Shut up slut! Chew up this mushroom
This'll help you get in touch with your roots
We'll get barefoot, butt-naked, and run in the woods
"Oh dag"
"I ain't mean for you to eat the whole bag"


"Yo Sue"
Oh shoot, she's tripping
I wasn't trying to turn this into something major
I just wanted to make you appreciate nature
Susan, stop crying, I don't hate ya
The world's not against you, I'm sorry your father raped you
So what you had your little coochie in your dad's mouth?
That ain't no reason to start wigging and spaz out
She said
I said, I'm high too bitch, quit grabbing my t-shirt (let go)
Would you calm down you're starting to scare me
She said
I don't even have any kids and I can't cook
(Hello) I'm over here Sue, (hi) you're talking to the plant, look
We need to get to a hospital 'fore it's too late
Cause I never seen no one eat as many 'shrooms as you ate


Susan (wait) Where you going? You better be careful
I'm not your dad, quit trying to swallow your tongue
Want some gum? Put down the scissors, 'fore you do something dumb
I'll be right back just chill, baby, please?
I gotta go find Dave he's the one who gave me these
"John, where's Dave at before I bash you"
"Dave! Pull up your pants, we need an ambulance
There's a girl upstairs talking to plants
Chopping her hair off, and there's only two days left
Of Spring Break, how long do these things take to wear off"
"I took three, she ate the other twenty-two caps
Now she's upstairs crying out her eyeballs, drinking Lysol"
"I know and it's my fault!"


My God, I'm so sorry!
I'm so sorry! Susan please wake up!
Please! Please wake up!! What are you doing?!
You're not dead!! You're NOT dead!
I know you're not dead! Oh my God
Susan, wake up, oh God[G] Eminem as Susan (the girl)

I went to John's rave with Ron and Dave
And met a new wave blonde babe with half of her head shaved
A nurse aid who came to get laid and *censored* up
With first aid tape and *censored* on the first date
Susan -- an ex-manic depressive who just moved from Houston
Who loves blues and alternative music (Whattup?)
Told me she was starvin, I said it wasn't a problem (Nah!)
I got a coupon for this pizza with everything on it
We can double the mushrooms and minus the sausage
Come on Sue, that's nonsense
Who's at the door? Pizza man!
Who ordered pizza? Susan, it's yours
If you got it with double mushrooms on it then I don't want it
Shutup Susan I'll pick em off it
Oh hell, I might as well try it, I'll be alright
Susan you just swallowed the wrong slice!!

Chorus: 1st repeat Em says "I'm sorry!" at the end
2nd repeat same as original Chorus

"Yo Sue!"
Oh shoot, she's tripping..
I wasn't tryin to turn this into somethin major
I just wanted to make you appreciate flavor
Susan, stop cryin, I don't hate ya
I'm sorry your father used to chase ya and spank ya with hangers
So what they locked you in the attic in your dad's house?
That ain't no reason to start wiggin and spaz out
She said
I said, "You're breaking out in hives, let go of the pizza!"
"Would you put it down you're startin to scare me"
She said
I don't even have any kids and I can't cook
(Hello!) I'm over here Sue, (hi) you're talkin to the plant, look!
We need to get to a hospital 'fore it's too late
Cause I never seen no-one eat as many *shrooms* as you ate

Chorus: 1st repeat Em says "Whoops!" after first line
And "It was an accident!" at the end
2nd repeat same as original Chorus

Susan (wait!) Where you goin? You better be careful
I'm not your dad, quit tryin to swallow your tongue
Want some gum? Put down the scissors, 'fore you do somethin dumb
I'll be right back just chill baby please?
I gotta go find Dave he majored in allergies
"John, where's Dave at before I bash you?"
"Dave! Pull up your pants, we need an ambulance
There's a girl upstairs talkin to plants
Choppin her hair off, and there's only two days left
Of Spring Break, how long do these things take to wear off?"
Just one, with double mushrooms by mistake
Now she's upstairs cryin out her eyeballs, breaking out in hives"
"I know and it's my fault!"

Chorus: 1st repeat Em says "I'm sorry!" after second line
And "What do I do?" at the end
2nd repeat same as original Chorus

My God, I'm so sorry!
I'm so sorry! Susan please wake up!
Please! Please wake up!! What are you doing?!
You're not dead!! You're NOT dead!
I know you're not dead![Intro]
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Okay, aight aight aight aight aight aight
Yo, yo.. yo, yo
Aight I'mma lay the chorus first
Here we go now

My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am, cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on, what I'm on, cause I'm my mom

My mom, my mom
I know you're probably tired
Of hearing bout my mom, oh-ho, whoa-ho
But this is just a story of when I was just a shorty
And how I became hooked on Va-aliu-ums
Valium was in everything, food that I ate
The water that I drank, fucking peas on my plate
She sprinkled just enough of it to season my steak
So every day I'd have at least three stomachaches
Now tell me, what kinda mother would wanna see her
Son grow up to be an under-a-fucking-chiever
My teacher didn't think I was gonna be nothing either
What the fuck you sticking gum up under the fucking seat for
Mrs. Mathers your son has been huffing ether
Either that or the motherfucker's been puffing reefer
But all this huffing and puffing wasn't what it was either
It was neither, I was buzzing but it wasn't what she thought
Pee in a teacup, bitch you ain't my keeper
I'm sleeping, what the fuck you keep on fucking with me for
Slut you need to leave me the fuck alone
I ain't playing, go find you a white crayon and color a fucking zebra


Wait a minute, this ain't dinner, this is paint thinner
You ate it yesterday, I ain't hear no complaints, did I
Now here's a plate full of painkillers, now just wait til
I crush the Valium and put it in your potatoes
You little motherfucker
I'll make you sit there and make that
Retarded fucking face without even tasting it
You better lick the fucking plate, you ain't wasting it
Put your face in it fore I throw you in the basement again
And I ain't giving in, you're gonna just sit there
In one fucking place finnickin til next Thanksgiving and
If you still ain't finished it I'll use the same shit again
Then when I make spinach dip it'll be placed in the shit
You little shit, wanna sit there and play innocent
A rack fell and hit me in K-Mart and they witnessed it
Child support, your father he ain't sent the shit
And so what if he did
It's none of your dang business, kid

My mom there's no one else quite like my mom
I know I should let bygones be bygones
But she's the reason why I am high on what I'm high on
Cause


My mom loved Valium, now all I am
Is a party animal, I am what I am
But I'm strong to the finish with me Valium spinach
But my buzz only lasts about two minutes
But I don't wanna swallow it without chewing it
I can't even write a rhyme without you in it
My Valium, my Vaaaaaa-liummmm, ohh
Man I never thought that I could ever be
A drug addict, naw
Fuck that I can't have it happen to me
But that's actually what has ended up happening
A tragedy
The fucking past ended up catching me
And it's probably where I got acquainted with the taste, ain't it
Pharmaceuticals are the bomb Ma, beautiful
She killed the fucking dog with the medicine she done fed it
Feed it a fucking aspirin and say that it has a headache
Here, want a snack
You hungry you fucking brat
Look at that, it's a Xanax
Take it and take a nap
Eat it
But I don't need it
Well fuck it then break it up
Take a little piece and beat it before you wake Nathan up
Aight Ma you win
I don't feel like arguing
I'll do it, pop it, gobble it and start wobbling
Stumble, hobble, tumble, slip, trip then I fall in bed
With a bottle of meds and a Heath Ledger bobblehead


My mom, I'm just like her
My mom, my mom, my mom
My mom, my mom, my mom
My mom, my mom, my mom
My mom, my momma
Me momma, ay like-a da momma
Haha, sorry mom
I still love you though
Dr. Dre 2010, ay this shit is hella hard homie

Hi, kids! Do you like violence?
Wanna see me stick Nine Inch Nails through each one of my eyelids?
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did?
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse than my life is?
My brain's dead weight, I'm trying to get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate
And Dr. Dre said "Slim Shady, you a basehead!" Uh-uhhh!
"So why's your face red? Man, you wasted!"
Well, since age twelve I felt like I'm someone else
Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass
Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
Come here, slut, "Shady wait a minute, that's my girl, dog!"
I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off

My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high
Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be thirty-five
I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler
Stapled his nuts to a stack of papers
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial running over pedestrians
In a spaceship while they're screaming at me, "Let's just be friends!"
99% of my life I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doing drugs and name it after her
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
And try to touch your hands like some screaming Usher fans
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph
So I signed it: "Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole"

Stop the tape! This kid needs to be locked away!
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate!
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
Am I coming or going? I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive?
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years, my palms too hairy to hide
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How you gonna breastfeed me, Mom? You ain't got no tits!
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
Put a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head
I'm steaming mad and by the way, when you see my dad
Tell him that I slit his throat in this dream I had

My English teacher wanted to have sex in Junior High
The only problem was my English teacher was a guy
I smacked him in his face with an eraser
Chased him with a stapler
Stapled his nuts to a stack of papers
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial killin pedestrians

Меня зовут... {скрип пластинки} Слим Шэйди
Привет! Меня зовут.. (ха?) Меня зовут... (что?)
Меня зовут... {скрип пластинки} Слим Шэйди


A, эмм.. простите!
Могу ли я привлечь внимание класса
на секундочку?

Первый куплет
Привет детки! Вам нравится насилие? (да, да, да!)
Хотите посмотреть, как я проткну себе веки 9-ти дюймовыми гвоздями? (у-а!)
Вы хотите подражать мне и повторить мой поступок? (да, да!)
Попробовать цианин и превратить свою жизнь в говно? (а?)
Мои мозги - мертвый груз, я пытаюсь прозреть
Но всё равно не в состоянии разобраться
Какую "Перчинку" мне хочется обрюхатить (уууу..)
Доктор Дре сказал, "Слим Шейди, ты – главный!""
У-у! "Тогда почему ты покраснел? Старик, да ты обдолбался!"
Да, с тех пор как мне стукнуло двенадцать
Я чувствовал себя кем-то другим, только не собой
Потому что я свесил на ремне свое истинное "я" с верхнего яруса койки
Взбесился и оторвал сиськи Памеле Ли
А затем как следует отлупил её, да так, что одежда оказалась сикось-накось как у Крисса Кросса
Я выкуриваю фунт отпадной травы и падаю на свою жопу
Быстрее жирухи,которая села слишком быстро
Иди-ка сюда, шлюха (Шейди, подожди минуточку, это моя девушка,Бро!)
Мне плевать, Господь послал меня разозлить мир...


Привет! Меня зовут.. (что?) Меня зовут... (кто)
Меня зовут... {скрип пластинки} Слим Шэйди
Привет! Меня зовут.. (ха?) Меня зовут... (что?)
Меня зовут... {скрип пластинки} Слим Шэйди

Второй куплет
Мой учитель английского хотел завалить меня
На экзамене в средней школе
Большое спасибо, в следующем семестре мне стукнет 35-ть
Я запустил ему в лицо стёркой, гонялся за ним со степлером
И приштамповал его яйца к бумаге
Я вошёл в стриптиз-клуб, застегнув куртку на молнию
Подбежал к бармену и положил свой хрен на тарелочку для чаевых
Инопланетянин давит на космической тарелке пешеходов
А они кричат: "ДАВАЙ ПРОСТО БУДЕМ ДРУЗЬЯМИ!"
99% моей жизни мне врали
Я только что узнал, что моя мама ширяется больше чем я (Черт!)
Я заявил ей, что, когда вырасту, стану великим рэпером
Запишу пластинку о наркоте и назову диск ее именем (O, спасибо!)
Знаешь, ты просто взрываешься, когда женщины сбивают тебя с ног
Пытаясь дотронуться до твоих рук
Наподобие кричащих фанаток Ашера (Aaaххххх!)
Этот парень в "Белом Замке" попросил у меня автограф
(Чувак, я могу получить твой автограф?)
Я подписал: 'Дорогой Дейв, спасибо за поддержку, ЗАСРАНЕЦ!'


Привет! Меня зовут.. (что?) Меня зовут... (кто?)
Меня зовут... {скрип пластинки} Слим Шэйди
Привет! Меня зовут.. (ха?) Меня зовут... (что?)
Меня зовут... {скрип пластинки} Слим Шэйди

Третий куплет
Остановите запись, этого пацана нужно посадить под стражу! (держите его!)
Доктор Дре, не стой как истукан, ОПЕРИРУЙ
Я не готов уходить, я боюсь смерти (Вот дерьмо!)
Меня надо отнести на кладбище и похоронить заживо
(Ха, точно!) я иду или еду? Я с трудом могу решить
Я только что выпил пятый стакан водки, разрешите мне сесть за руль? (валяй)
Всю свою жизнь я был лишен радостей этой жизни
У меня много лет не было женщины
И мне не просто спрятать свои волосатые ладони
(Уппсс!) одежда разорвана, как у “Невероятного Халка” (хача-ту)
Я плююсь,когда я разговариваю
Я бы трахал всё, что движется (ну же)
В детстве я был таким голодным, что впадал в истерику
КАК ЖЕ ТЫ СОБИРАЕШЬСЯ НАКОРМИТЬ МЕНЯ ГРУДЬЮ, МАМА? (Ух!)
У ТЕБЯ ЖЕ НЕТ СИСЕК! (Аххх!)
Я не сплю и привязываю самого себя ремнем в постели
Одеваю пуленепробиваемый жилет и стреляю себе в голову (Ба-бах!)
Я выхожу из себя (аааггггххх!)
И, кстати говоря, когда ты видела моего отца? (а?)
Расскажи ему, что я во сне перерезал ему глотку...

Привет! Меня зовут.. (что?) Меня зовут... (кто?)
Меня зовут... {скрип пластинки} Слим Шэйди
Привет! Меня зовут.. (ха?) Меня зовут... (что?)
Меня зовут... {скрип пластинки} Слим Шэйди[Produced by Dr. Dre]

Hi kids, do you like violence?
Wanna see me stick Nine Inch Nails through each one of my eyelids?
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did?

My brain's dead weight
I'm trying to get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate

Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
Come here, slut
"Shady wait a minute, that's my girl, dog!"
I don't give a fuck
God sent me to piss the world off[Intro]
This motherfucker, man!
Just won't shut up will you?
Talking 'bout I owe him
Bitch, you owe me... I'm promoting you right now
Yo, let's put the nail in his coffin

I don't wanna be like this
I don't really wanna hurt no feelings
But I'm only being real when I say
Nobody wants to hear they grandfather rap (nope)
And old men have heart attacks
And I don't wanna be responsible for that, so
Put the mic down and walk away
You can still have a little bit of dignity

I would never claim to be no Ray Benzino
An 83-year-old fake Pacino
So how can he hold me over some balcony without
Blowing his lower back out as soon as he goes to lift me?
Please don't -- you'll probably fall with me, and our asses'll both be history
But then again you'd finally get your wish
Cause you'll be all over the street like 50 Cent
Fucking punk pussy, fuck you, chump
Give me a one on one; see if I don't fuck you up
Tried to jump the Ruff Ryders and they cut you up
And you put Jada on a track, that's how much you suck dick
In the industry, swear that you in the streets hustling
You sit behind a fucking desk at The Source butt-kissing
And begging motherfuckers for guest appearances
And you can't even get the clearances, cause real lyricists
Don't even respect you or take you serious
It's not that we don't like you -- we hate you, period
Talk about a mid-life crisis, damn
Last week you was shaking Obie Trice's hand
Now he's a buster? What the fuck's with that?
Get on a track dissing us, kissing 50's ass
And asking me what I know about indictments, bite me
Bitch, I got two cases and probation, fight me!
What do I know about standing in front of a judge like a man
Ready to take whatever sentence he hands?
What you know about your wife slicing her wrists
Right in front of the only thing you have in this world, a little girl?
And I put that on her, when this is all over
I would never try to make her a star and eat off her
I don't know shit about no chopping rocks
But what you know about Hip Hop Shops rocking spots
Where you the only white boy up in that bitch just ripping?
Pressing up your own fliers and your stickers, sticking
Them bitches up after spending six hours at Kinko's
Just making copies of your covers of cassette singles
To sell them out of the trunk of your Tracer
Spending your whole paychecks at Disc Makers
What you know about being bullied over half your life?
Oh that's right, you should know what that's like, you're half white
Vanilla Ice, spill the beans and rice
I'm eating you alive inside, Jesus Christ!
If you're that much of a gangsta, put the mic down
You should be out killing motherfuckers right now!
Kill a motherfucker dead, kill him dead, bitch!
Shoot 'em in the fucking head -- go ahead, bitch!
Slap my mom; slap the fuck out of her!
She can't sue you; she wouldn't get a buck out of ya
Cause you're broke as fuck, you suck, you're a fucking joke
If you was really selling coke, well then what the fuck
You stop for, dummy? If you slew some crack
You'd make a lot more money then you do from rap
You'll never have no security, you'll never be famous
You'll never know what it's like to be rich; life's a bitch ain't it
Raymond? Here let me break the shit down in layman's
Terms for you, just to make sure that you can understand it
And Canibus ain't using too many complicated fucking words for you
Here let me slow it down for so you could understand if I say it slower
...let it go dog, it's over


Haha... talking 'bout, I have motherfuckers calling your crib
Bitch, you ain't even got a fucking crib!
You ain't even got a fucking phone... fucking bum
Threatening to shut me down at ya lil' fucking Source magazine
If I come back when did I attack you?
BITCH you attacked me first take it like a man and shut the FUCK UP
Fuck your little magazine too
I don't need your little fucking magazine
I got XXL's number anyways
And y'all can't stand it cause they getting bigger than y'all
Oh, and by the way... how'd I look on the VMA's?
When you was watching me from whatever fucking TV you was watching me from
From Boston...the mean streets of Boston
Fucking sissy, and you got us scared up in that motherfucker?
Suck my motherfucking dick
Oh! And for those that don't know
Don't get it twisted y'all
The Source has a white owner![Intro]
Eminem: Denaun, what up man?
Denaun: What up dawg?
Em: Ya alright?
De: Chillin', cold as hell
Em: Yes it is, hey bus didn't come here did it?
De: No, hey look, you got fifteen cent?
Em: Nah, I got just enough to get on the bus, I'm broke
De: We gotta go to the store alright man quick cause I'm short
Em: Yeah, we gonna have enough time to go to the store?
De: Nah, look
Em: You should just, how much you got there?
De: I only got 75, I'm sure I got a dollar, know what I mean
Em: Just throw it in there they ain't gonna know
You know what aye look, I'm sick of taking this damn bus everywhere man
De: You gotta make some moves or something
Em: I know, look, I'm trying to get rich
I got a baby on the way, I don't even got a car
You know what I'm saying?
De: I still stay with my moms, 21 and still with my moms
Em: Yeah look hey, we gotta make some hit records or something
You know what I'm saying? Cause I'm tired of being broke

Cause all I do is yearn a life without a concern
And dream of having a turn to earn money to burn
Mapping out my strategies to get rich huh
My desire is like a scratch that needs to get itched huh
Cause man I live in the D, this shit ain't given for free
Nothing's different to me, so what else is there to see
I'll be the prisoner to flee, from all of this misery
I'm not wishing to be another fish in the sea
But just an MC, so listen to me for this and agree
Your mission the key, you ain't even in the vicinity
Unconditionally my aspects to cash checks
My objects were never to swab decks
It's up to you the decision is yours
If what you vision is tours, or a missionless course
When your shit is in the stores, cause you can be a star

No matter wherever you are, you're never too far
From revenue par, cause you can be king
You can rule the world, you can do anything
It's on you baby, cause you can be a star
No matter wherever you are, you're never too far
From revenue par, cause you can be king
You can rule the world, you can do anything
It's on you baby, cause you can be a star
No matter wherever you are, you're never too far
From revenue huh

Em: You know what I'm saying, see what I'm talking about man?
Cause that's it. Yeah. A million dollars ain't even that far away man
De: Yo we got to get the money man, I can't be broke for the rest of my life
Em: Yeah I hear what your saying. Look there's got to be something better, you know what I'm saying?
De: I can't live like this for the rest of my life man, bumming rides everywhere I go
Em: Yeah, what's up with Lexus and Land Cruisers?

Yo I'm not about to chance it and dismiss handling business
I'm canceling Christmas to gamble and risk this
Financial interest is the matter at hand
I got an adequate plan for stab at a grand
I grab what I can and do what I must
Pursue what I lust, it's true that I just choose
The few that I trust, thems the people that I still got
Fuck with gangsta Philpot, get your grill shot
The 5 Ela for life my man Thyme
Proof, Kyu and Denaun, we move through the nine
My crews true and divine, we never fronted
We just wanted to be funded, and live to be a hundred
Instead of hunted or being wanted as fugitives
It's all about a man planning what his future is
What he can do for his to be a star


That's what I'm talking about, I'm not trying to be the player
I'm trying to be the man, I'm want to be president
Yo forgot that president man I'm trying to be king
Making dead presidents, you know what I'm saying?
Yeah
Getting money any time I want owning my own businesses and all that
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah, I'm trying to be a millionaire man, hahaha, but don't all you know
You only live once
'96, baby[Verse 1: Eminem]
There's not much you could do or say to phase me
People think I'm a little bit crazy
I get it from all angles, even occasionally Doc Dre-zie'll
Have to step in every once in a while to save me
To make me stop and think about it 'fore I just say things
Sometimes I forget what other people just may think
A lot of rappers probably wouldn't know how to take me
If they heard some shit, I'd lay the tape 'fore they erase me
I may be a little too fast paced and racy
Sometimes the average listener rewinds and plays me twenty times
Cause I say so many rhymes, it may seem like I'm goin too fast cuz my mind is racing
And I could give a fuck what category you place me
Long as when I'm pushing up daisies and gone
As long as you place me amongst one of them greats
When I hit the heavenly gates I'll be cool beside Jay-Z
For every single die hard fan who embraced me
I'm thankful for the talent in which God gave me
And I'm thankful for the environment that he placed me
Believe it or not, I thank my mom for how she raised me
In the neighborhood daily, they jumped and chased me
It only made me what I am today, see
Regardless of what anybody believes who hates me
You ain't gonna make or break me
Tryna strip me of my credibility and make me look fake, G
You're only gonna be in for a rude awakening
Cause sooner or later you haters are all gonna face me
And when you face me with all the shit you've been saving to say to me
You had all this time to think about it
Now don't pussy out and try to about face me
Cause I've been Patiently Waiting for the day
That we finally meet in the same place to see

No matter how many battles I been in and won
No matter how many magazines on my nuts
No matter how many emcees I eat up
Ooh ooh, it's never enough

My flow's untouchable now you gotta face it
Uh oh, it gets worse when I go back to the basics
You go say the wrong shit and get your face split
The smell of victory, love it so much I can taste it
I spot my target, blaze it, direct hit
Graze it, your peace talk, save it
You shit sounds dated, you're overrated
I'm obligated to study your moves then crush you motherfuckers
If I'm the best and the worst, then God's gift is a curse
Soldier trained to destroy, you payin' attention boy?
I spit shit, slick shit, so quick you miss it
To be specific I go ballistic as hieroglyphic
My music is a drug, press play, you ain't gotta sniff it
Chew it or pop it, roll a bag or chop it
Get your high over and over, but you gotta cop it
When it's hot, it's hot
Your hatin' is undeniable, stop it

No matter how many battles I been in and won
No matter how many magazines on my nuts
No matter how many emcees I eat up
Ooh ooh, it's never enough[Verse 1: Eminem]
In my mind I'm a fighter, my heart's a lighter
My soul is the fluid, my flow sparks it right up
An arsenic writer, Author with Arth-r-itis
Carpel-tunnel, Marshall with start shit-itis
Hard-headed and hot-headed
Bull-headed and pig-headed
Dick-headed a prick, a big headache I'm sick
Quick-witted for every lyric spitted
There are 6 critics who wait, for me to slip with it
So quick this dynamite stick, bury the wick
It's gonna ex-plode any minute, some lunatic
Lit it and it's not Nelly, do not tell me to stop yelling
When I stop selling I'll quit so, stop dwelling
I am not failing, you fuckers are not ready
Cause I got jelly, like Beyonce's pot belly
This is destiny, yes money
I'm off running, so get off of me
I'm not slowing or softening

No apologies, nah suckers I'm not sorry
You can all sue me; y'all could be the cause of me
No apologies, y'all feeling the force of me
No remorse for me, like there was no recourse (nah) for me
No apologies, not even acknowledging you at all
Till I get a call that God's coming
No apologies, laugh fuckers, its all funny
I can spit in your face while you're standing across from me
No apologies

My head hits the pillow, a weeping willow
I can't sleep, a pain so deep it bellows
But these cellos, help just to keep me mellow
Hands on my head, touch knees to elbows
I'm hunched over emotion just flows over
These cold shoulders are both frozen
You don't know me
I keep saying it, I can't stress it enough
So keep playing it, and stand next to the subs
I choke mics like asphyxation
When I'm strangling my own throat masturbating
Fuck yeah I'm a basket case
And I mastered this rap shit till my ass gets wasted
Till my assassination, till I'm slain cuz of some fags infatuation
.44 Mag's fascination a taste for disaster and if that's the case then


This song isn't for you it's for me
A true MC, it's what he'll do
Just to see if he still has it
And if his skills mastered
He's able to spill raps long after he's killed that's a
Real MC got you feeling me
Whether willing or unwillingly, you still agree
As long as there's still this hunger, and will in me
Then expect a longer life expectancy
I'd be a savage beast if I ain't had this outlet to salvage me
Inside, I'd be exploding soaked in self loathing
And mourning so I'm warning you don't coax me
It's silly, I’m really a sheep in wolf's clothing
Who only reacts when he gets pushed don't be
Fooled, the press blows up this whole thing
It's stupid, they don't know cuz they don't see
That I'm wounded, all they did was ballooned it
I'm sick of talking bout these tattoos Cartoon did
That's why I tuned it out I'm sick of duking
They can suck my dick while I'm puking, and you too you can

Expect no sympathy from me
I'm an MC, this is how I'm supposed to be
Cold as a G, my heart's frozen it don't even beat
So expect no apologies
Expect no sympathy from me
I'm an MC, this is how I'm supposed to be
Cold as a G, my heart's frozen it don't even beat
So expect no apologies[Intro]

Throw dirt on me and grow a wildflower
But it's "fuck the world", get a child out her
Yeah my life a bitch, but you know nothin' 'bout her
Been to Hell and back, I can show you vouchers
I'm rollin' Sweets, I'm smokin' sour
Married to the game, but she broke her vows
That's why my bars are full of broken bottles
And my night stands are full of open Bibles
I think about more than I forget
But I don't go 'round fire expecting not to sweat
And these niggas know I lay 'em down, make your bed
Bitches try to kick me while I'm down: I'll break your leg
Money outweighin' problems on the triple beam
I'm stickin' to the script, you niggas skippin' scenes
Be good or be good at it
Fuckin' right I've got my gun, semi-Cartermatic
Yeah, put a dick in their mouth, so I guess it's "fuck what they say"
I'm high as a bitch: up, up and away, man, I come down in a couple of days
OK, you want me up in the cage, then I'll come out in beast mode
I got this world stuck in the safe, combination is the G code
It's Weezy motherfucker, Blood gang and I'm in bleed mode
All about my dough but I don't even check the peephole
So you can keep knockin', but won't knock me down
No love lost, no love found

It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now
You kicked me when I was down
But what you say just (don't hurt me, don't hurt me no more)
That's right bitch: and I don't need you, don't want to see you
Bitch you get (no love)
You show me nothin' but hate
You ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes around
I don't need you (don't hurt me)
You (don't hurt me no more)
That's right, and I don't need you, don't want to see you
You get (no love)
Bitch you get (no love)
And I don't need you
Get 'em

I'm alive again, more alive than I have been in my whole entire life
I can, see these people's ears perk up as I begin to spaz with the pen
I'm a little bit sicker than, most
Shit's finna get thick again
They say the competition is stiff
But I get a hard dick from this shit, now stick it in
I ain't never givin' in again
Caution to the wind, complete freedom
Look at these rappers, how I treat 'em
So why the fuck would I join them when I beat 'em
They call me a freak cause I like to spit on these pussies 'fore I eat 'em
Man get these whack cocksuckers off stage
Where the fuck is Kanye when you need him?
Snatch the mic from 'em, bitch I'ma let you finish in a minute
Yeah that rap was tight
But I'm 'bout spit the greatest verse of all time
So you might want to go back to the lab tonight and um
Scribble out them rhymes you were going to spit
And start over from scratch and write new ones
But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference
When I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight
It's an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump
From the place all the way to the parking lot, fellow
Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd
You can see the sparks from hot metal
Cold-hearted from the day I Bogarted the game
My soul started to rot, fellow
When I'm not even in my harshest
You can still get roasted cause Marsh is not mellow
'til I'm topplin' from the top I'm not going to stop
I'm standin' on my Monopoly board
That means I'm on top of my game
And it don't stop 'til my hip don't hop anymore
When you're so good that you can't say it
Cause it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore
People just get sick cause you spit
These fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore
And you can never break my stride
You'll never slow the momentum at any moment, I'm 'bout to blow
You'll never take my pride, killin' the flow, slow venom
And the opponent is gettin' no mercy, mark my words
Ain't lettin' up, relentless, I smell blood
I don't give a fuck: keep givin' 'em hell
Where was you when I fell and needed help up?
You get no love

It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now
You kicked me when I was down
But what you say just (don't hurt me, don't hurt me no more)
That's right bitch: and I don't need you, don't want to see you
Bitch you get (no love)
You show me nothin' but hate
You ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes around
I don't need you (don't hurt me)
You (don't hurt me no more)
That's right, and I don't need you, don't want to see you
You get (no love)
Bitch you get (no love)
And I don't need you
Get 'em[Intro: Bizarre]
Yeah...ha ha ha (BANG!), Yeah, Bizarre Kid coming at you
Eminem and Fuzz, and Mr. Swifty, ha ha
No one's iller than me (what)
No one, no one is iller than me
No one is iller than me
It's Mr. Swifty from the 313

I make rappers wanna turn into singers
I keep hoes licking they fingers
Bring this competition and face this meaning
Got your whole crew doing subpoenas
Hell nah you ain't seen a crew genius
Murder whoever's between us, pack your heaters
Keep it close, you can't beat us
While your whole crew treat us like G's, you best believe this
I done made quadriplegics outta these non-rapping rejects
While the whole world ejects your tape
It ain't no secret that your shit sounds fake
You can't stop it my mind state
Makes it too late for cops in trying to stop the crime rate
I'm like toothaches, I'm painful to rappers then you can tell
From these shells, how I gotta bend 'em like root canals
I erase all trails, something farther from getting bail
Makes you wanna kill an emcee yourself, you might as well
Be within a 25 to life sentence, on linking trials
Horrified, and keep on fronting, repenting and lose they bowels
Everything is foul when Swift's around, vacate now
Niggas dumb enough to try to front and escape, how?
I'm gonna take this 'gnac and drink it straight wild
Niggas steady falling in my face like milk crates, BLAAAOW
It's Swifty from the 313
Like I said no one is iller than me, unnhh

Me and Eminem and Mike
Driving down Van Dyke
Get my dick sucked late at night by a fuckin' transvestite
Still on probation for strangling my boy Jason
Should be taking my medication, it's 9 to 10 I'm facing
Last week this old man I had to blast
Cause he tried to help me out when my car was out of gas
Ripped this old lady, hung her neck by a hook
Didn't realize it was my grandmother 'til I checked her pocketbook
Fuckin' with the white boys got me back on crack
Better explain where the hell your TVs and VCRs is at
I done lost 100 pounds, I ain't been eating like I should
This wounded dog in the street is sure looking good
Rob this little boy in his fucking paper route
Throwing bombs at day care centers and yell "Everybody get out!"
My girl beat my ass and shot me in the back with a 2-piece
Cause she found out I was having an affair with her 10-year-old niece

No one, no one's iller than me
It's Bizarre Kid straight from the 313
No one, no one is iller than me
It's Bizarre Kid straight from the 313

Nobody better test me, cause I don't wanna get messy
Especially when I step inside this bitch, dipped freshly
New Lugz, give the crew hugs, guzzle two mugs
Before I do drugs that make me throw up like flu bugs
True thugs, rugged unshaven messy scrubs
Whipping 40-bottles like the fucking Pepsi clubs
Down a fifth; crack open a six;
I'm on my seventh 8-ball, now I gotta take a piss
I'm hollering at these hoes that got boyfriends
Who gives a fuck who they was?
I'm always taking someone else's girl like Cool J does
They probably don't be packing anyways, do they, Fuzz?
We walked up, stomped they asses and blew they buzz
Mics get sandblasted
Stab your abdomen with a hand crafted pocketknife and spill your antacid
Sprayed your motherfucking crib up when I ran past it
Fucking felon, headed to hell in a handbasket
Talking shit'll get you, your girl and your man blasted
Kidnapped and slapped in a van wrapped in Saran plastic
Get your damn ass kicked, by these fantastic
Furious four motherfuckers
Flashing in front of your face without the Grand Masters
Slim Shady, ain't nobody iller than me

I run shit like an ass with legs
Massive lead to leave your cabbage red
Similar to your ass in a casket dead
Drastic spread of acid heads
Come to abort you like a bastard egg
That trash you said got you standing on plastic legs
Ask the feds from past the edge
Rocking the most classic threads
Flashing bread, roll down the window
Bitch you got some fantastic legs, you can get 'til that ass get red
You can get 'til that ass get red
Bizarre you get him and him, Swift you get him and him
I'll get him and him, leave the other two for my nigga Eminem
Never writer's block, I block writers
My block's tighter, ante up and get your top fighters
Got fired for jumping the counter with a mop stick
Some bitch ran up screaming, "GET THE COPS, QUICK"
And got drop kicked, now she screaming "stop it"
Got clips to stop shit, rock shit and grab this hot shit
Wherever you shop bitch, Fuzz Scoota '97 crop pick
Sick-a y'all niggas looking at me like I got tits
I shoot a rocket through your optic
You niggas still don't know the top pick
I got bricks, lose my foot in your ass
And have you shitting socks bitch
P Rock shit, leave your fucking knot split
Grab the green from Al by showing him hot grits (no one)
Ain't nobody iller than me

It's the Mr. Fuzzy from the 313
No one, no one is iller than me
It's Eminem and Swift from the 313
No one, no one is iller than me
It's Fuzz and Buzz-arre from the 313

You have now witnessed 4 ill emcees
From the home of potholes and trash
We'll lyrically blast[Intro]
Yeah, it's been a ride
I guess I had to go to that place to get to this one
Now some of you might still be in that place
If you're trying to get out, just follow me
I'll get you there

You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
Cause ain't no way I'mma let you stop me from causing mayhem
When I say I'mma do something I do it, I don't give a damn
What you think, I'm doing this for me, so fuck the world
Feed it beans, it's gassed up, if it thinks it's stopping me
I'mma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtably
And all those who look down on me I'm tearing down your balcony
No if ands or buts don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album he's still shitting
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a "fuck you" for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the earth he's got the urge
To pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the whole universe

I'm not afraid to take a stand
Everybody come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

Ok quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words
In the rhythm for you to know it's a rap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
For that fuck your feelings
Instead of getting crowned you're getting capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise, in fact
Let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was “ehhhh”
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't going back to that now
All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack BLAOW
Cause I ain't playin' around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still trying to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't
This fucking black cloud still follows me around
But it's time to exorcise these demons
These motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now


And I just can't keep living this way
So starting today, I'm breaking out of this cage
I'm standing up, I'mma face my demons
I'm manning up, I'mma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now

It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, believe me you
I have been through the wringer,  but they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers, and drop dead
No more beef lingers, no more drama from now on, I promise
To focus solely on handling my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof
Like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it
Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
Cause I'm raising the bar, I shoot for the moon
But I'm too busy gazing at stars, I feel amazing and...

You know what you're doing when you do it for the ladies
So won't you please step up to the mic baby?

It's been a little boring lately
I've been playing in poison ivy and pee
I've been itching to get in some S-H-I-T
You heard what I S-A-I-D
This club? I guess they I.D
But they just let me in without it so I guess they like me
I put on my best dang white tee[Intro]
Uh, uh, uh, play that shit
What the fuck you doing Stretch
Gotta stretch your neck
You better protect it
I’mma inspect today
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ho, ho

Where’s my words at
Yo see Slim Shady yo, where the birds at
Me and Flip the middle ones
Rappers get these little ones in they mouth
These little nuts, yeah
Shit, I don’t care I ain’t afraid to admit it
I got a little dick yeah, but so do you
You scared to admit it
You won’t spit it on this mother friggen mic
Cause I will strike and smack your ass like a friggen fag
And I don’t care if you get offended
I never pretended to rock this microphone beef
You wanna start it now we’ll end it
Cause when I slip in the zone up on this microphone
People want me to do a written rap but fuck that go home
I don’t really give a damn I’ll kick right off of the top
And everything that I drop always gonna remain hot
Let on the spot, Slim, I mean woops, Grim it’s when im dim
Yo, I’m in affect mode
Rappers get they neck sewed
Get they whole threshold fucked up
Get they game presto
Ha, ha
I busted, I kill it, I crush it, I do it, the fluid, I spill it, I’m ill wit
These motherfucking rhymes that I be coming with there running with me
Kick you in the motherfucking stomach shit
Cause you don’t want none of it
Rappers always try but they always die
And rappers always stuck to me and tried to lie
(Arf, Arf)
Yo, where my dogs at
Yo (err, ribbit) where my frogs at
In the house, It really doesn’t matter cause I still turn it out
When I step on this mic, smacking your spouse
Ha, Ha
The illest MC to come off the top
When I get this drum off
Yo Strech give me a break, let me catch my friggen breath
And till` the death, bust rhymes till` there’s none left
I’m wanted for theft and robbery
And probably smack a bitch up in the lobby G
Cause she don’t want none of me
I’m the illest MC to ever hold a cordless on the planet earth and you’ll see
That I’m from the friggen D
Ya’ll don’t get my point I’m from Detroit
Smoking fake grass like a joint
That’s the first simplest rhyme I ever said in my life
But, at the end of the night I’ll still be fucking your wife
Shit, I really don’t care your style needs to switch
Cause you ain’t rich, that’s why you ain’t rich
Remain underground, can’t come off the top
You can’t drop rhymes nonstop like this
I might twist my friggen dick up in your ear
Rappers always wanna stand clear
I’m a motherfucking landmine
Ya’ll don’t understand mine
I’m Slim Shady showing out like my tan line
Ha, ha
The illest MC to rhyme
Every time the illest MC of our time
I rhyme time and time twice but I’m nice
With this mic device I slice right through your Adams apple
I had a Snapple and a motherfriggen syringe
Up in the bathroom I shouldn’t have but yo I boinked
To any MC up in this shit who want some
To any MC who wanna step up and get some
Get done, fuck competition
Let me catch my breath one more time
Yo, I’m on a mission
To stomp any MC comp I just trunked
And swamp is this truamp a word?, no its not
Yo, but here I go with this lyrical, lyricols, spiritual flows, that I slow
Driving MC’s crazy, Slim Shady, up in your motherfucking radio babyOh no what's happening to my brain
I can't believe this is happening again

Lava on my lips I flips, wake up think I have a cramp
I'm trying to shove the lava lamp up my father's ass
I think I'm out of gas, man, I think I need another mask
I'd ask my mother but I think she's laughing at the plants
A half a gram of graham crackers and some Van de Kamp's
I think I'll eat some Ambiens like they're candied yams
Cut a couple cadavers up and have a little snack
Abra-fucking-cadabra, motherfucker look who's back
Just like a pendulum, Satan's pentagram swings
I accidentally dented it and bent the damn thing
Shit I think I might have did it when I was dancing
While I was chopping one of my legs off and pulled a hamstring
First I Re-Up, then I Relapse
Go to rehab and I Detox after I see Doc
And I'll be back with the sequel, repeat the cycle
Cause I react like the "She-Hulk" when I see Nyquil

Oh no
Here we go again
Don't know
When it's going to end
Oh oh
Where did it begin
Don't know
Maybe way back when
(Relapse!)

Into the well, baby Jessica fell, she may have wetted herself
Quit playing, get her some help
Mary Kay Letourneau sending me letters from jail, every day in journals
Saying how, she wanted to smother me in lettuce and mayo
I'm the medicine man, my medical marijuana
Was prescribed by a doctor, shove a typewriter up
Perez Hilton's ass, shit, almost forgot that
He's always shoving something up his ass so why not that?
And fuck it while I'm venting let's shove a vending machine
Up his rear end when he's bending over pretending that he
Didn't say anything that would be offending to me
Stick his head in a blender, begin blending and gee
Where should I put the pink sissy with the fluffy hair?
Put him under the stairs? People are already under there
Hmm, I wonder where. Wait, I think the cubpoard's bare
Stuff him up in the tupperware and shove him up in there


Vicodin's like a nitrogen hydrogen vitamin
I bite into five and then I get high as a kite again
I like it when I get in my zone on the mic again
Who am I kidding? I couldn't quit this shit if my life depends
I relapsed twice after I came outta Brighton then
Yeah, rehab's nice, I had my name up in lights again
You see that's why I can't decipher what life I'm in
I might pull a knife on your wife and slice her and dice her then
It sounds so enticing, isn't it nice when I'm hype again?
I'm nice when I'm like this, no time to write just type it in
If I could get my pen to slow down, what'd I write just then?
Man I'm 'bout to hyperventilate, I just have hyper-tension
I have the type of mental state you couldn't comprehend
Unusually stupid of you to think I'm your friend
I usually do what I do and suffer no consequence
I offer no mercy, the controversy is once again


Good evening, this is your fucking captain speaking
We will soon be reaching an altitude of 4 million and a half feet
That's 8 million miles in the sky
Please, undo your seat belt for takeoff
You are now free to smoke about the cabin

I'm Dre from back in the day
From N.W.A., from black and the gray
From choking a bitch to smacking her face
From stacking up bodies to racking AKs up
From racking up hits to stacking them crates up
I'm still hungry and I'm back with a tapeworm
And we're what's happening in rap entertainment
Me and Shady, far as competition? Faggot, there ain't none
Speak of the devil, it's attack of the Rain Man
Chainsaw in hand, bloodstain on my apron
Soon as the blade spun - vrunn! - they run away from
Who wanna play dungeon? No one is safe from
In search of a brain surgeon, a great one
Wait, it ain't funny, man, it's urgent, I need one
2 boxes of detergent and a paint gun
And an emergency squirt gun to spray A-1, so

One more time for old time's sake
Dre drop that beat, and scratch that break
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go (you are now smoking with the best)

Smoke signal in the sky like Verizon Wireless
A nice environment, surprised entirely
Hypotized by the sound, I surround the hydrants
Taking lives of firemen
Say goodbye, here I am again, naked wives and Vicodin
Before I begin to get so high, pussy; boy, I could spin
"Vinn-vinn!"; Fuck the handle, I fly off the hinge
Let that boy off the bench, coach, and throw it to him
There he goes in his trenchcoat, no clothes again
Baby, make us some french toast and show us some skin
I'll show you every inch grows on my foreskin
Show me nipple, I'mma pinch both and throw up a ten
Now you know it's a sin to tease, blow us again
The sorcerer of intercourse; if it's forced, it's him
Don't fight the feelin' if you're feelin' the force within
Then when you wake up in the morning next to the porcelain, so

One more time for old time's sake
Dre drop that beat, and scratch that break
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go (you are now smoking with the best)

Now where there's smoke there's fire
Where there's fire there's flames
Where there's flames there's chronic
Either you high or you ain't
I got no time for no games
Nuh-uh, he ain't playin'
He's gonna get the AK and aim it right at your brain
I'm slightly insane, vodka and creatine
Hypnotiq and Red Bull, it's an incredible energy drink
And it's giving me wings, I believe I can fly
While I pee on the girl, you won't catch me, C.S.I
It's as easy as pie, and as simple as cake
Dre, get on the mic and make 'em tremble and shake
Now put your smoke up in the air, raise your Henny and Coke
And if you really wanna get fucked up, just let me know
We can smoke 'til there's no more lighter fluid to do it
Let's get into it, you're smoking with the triedest and truest
I got the Midas touch when it comes to rolling shit up
You motherfuckers ain't smoking, you just holding shit up
Now here we go let's get up, get down, hold up a blunt
I smoke the kinda stuff that make the records go number one
Cause if at first you don't succeed, won't hurt to smoke some weed
Now them words are just a little more personal for me
Seein' as how, I blew up off of puffing them trees
Well, smoke enough for me! Fuck yeah, light it up Cheech
C'mon, smoke me out, cuz! Give me contact buzz
Get me on track, they love me when I'm on that stuff
"But this is Earth calling, Shady man, come on back!" What?
"Man we're losin' him, he won't even respond back, fuck!"
Now look at all the pretty women in here (Damn bitches)
Dre, it's hot, I think we better go check on their temperatures
I'll get the thermometer, you get the bandages
Now baby just bend over, this won't hurt a damn bit just[Intro]
I'm the man!

I stand in, flapped by the wind as I begin
Do you know who I am? And met a reply with a grin
Yes, I'm tired of being untooted
Why should I be secluded? I've got a brand new horn to be tooted
To sum it up in a nutshell, "M&M will you kick it for me?"
A place where I dwell in, pull onto some wonderful productions
To make up for lost time, anything is obstruction
Finally let loose, unloading the stockpile
A mental projectile, I aim like the Reptile
I look to the one-handed juggler and ask him this
"Why do you insist on stepping to an octopus?"
Is there a reason for this? The hatred is aggravating
How many times will it take you before you realise you're fading?
Fading from existence because simulations are dead
There's so much more to learn, and pages left to be read
So put up the front, while you jam for the grammar that's poor
While I hold the scrapbook, that's heavier than the hammer of the mighty Thor
Words can weigh a ton, therefore its never to fall into the hands of the wrong one


Yeah, Yeah x8
Its another

Very few have made an attempt to put a foot on the other side
But I see no borderline from under this colorblind
Now some will probably never hold pieces of the sacred
But then I'm finally about to put an end to the hatred
War, the world will never enter the arguing
Awakening to the absence of unity is startling
Oh foolish pride, what the hell is you trying to do?
You cannot beat someone that's better than you, so quit trying to
The echo we want don't mean nothing by despicable
So how do you think you can manage to kick the unkickable?
You're graceless, bland, you're tasteless and you're faceless and you're dull
Its time you faced this, here, taste this
Straight from off of the pile, one of the numerous styles
The date of my birth on the earth, the deliverance of a star child
Rest with formidable talent and versatility
But such a power, there comes a responsibility
To infringe on the boundaries so now the defiance is clear
To form an alliance that's something even the giants fear
So instead of being oblivious to a color of skin
Rufuser abusing is accepted, now its a trend


You know, I don't understand why we all just can't get along
You hate me, but you know me and what I stand for
No? so why do you speak for me and every other white man when you say that we're your enemy?

On the floor lies a broken door, because I'm not to be spoken for
Stereotypes and superstitions, and fictional folklore
Rarely do you see the lighter side of me
I try to be persuasive but oh, so impatient!
Been trying to end the rivalry
But I've heard the entice delayed it, apologies are exhausted
Feelings are turning glacial, never to be defrosted
Who can I trust after repeatedly being shafted?
Switch to the opposite, now scenes are being reenacted
Pull up, set fort by his group, his tour is quick
He's practiced obviating, we hate him as bad as a pastor, huh
Always fighting for the position of top dog
The spots already occupied and I don't play leap frog
Because I do not wish to fight over territory that's already mine
But I'm always having to prove myself time after time
Oh How I never understand how a man could be outcast
Judged from the past and he's put last
But nothing but nothing to say, stuttering and slurring
And muttering words with no meaning, attack me sounding like Danny K
Here I go again, hammering, stammering, grammaring
Eating it like cheese, pass me the crackers please
I've got a craving

I'm the man![Intro: Fatt Father]
I told y'all motherfuckers I was coming back (oh shit)
What now nigga, what now? What? Brewster Projects nigga

One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off, party stops
Everybody hit the door, somebody's licking shots off

Security's gone, I'm trapped in the club
And I'm trying to run and get my motherfucking gun
(Nigga what about yo' wife?) Nigga fuck my wife
I'm trying to run and save my motherfucking life
Oh, shit! The shooter's coming
Bitches hollering, niggas running
People, shot all over the floor
And I'm trying to make it to the St. Andrew's door
(Hey man) {*chk-chk-BOOM*} That's the sound of the Glock
Even DJ Houseshoes fucked around and got shot
I done messed around, and forget my tec
I don't see nobody, but Fat Father and Hex

(Kuniva, you hurt?) These niggas is tripping
(Where's Bizarre at?) (I don't know, man)
I'm trying to slip through the exit and get to where my car is at
Bitches screaming everywhere and niggas is wilding
Two minutes ago we was all joking and smiling
This chick is clinging on to me, sobbing and sighing
Saying she didn't mean to diss me earlier and she crying
But it's real and it's on and caps is getting peeled
So I hugged her and used her body as a human shield and
She got hit and now she's yelling (DON'T LEAVE ME!)
I told her I'd be right back and the dumb bitch believed me!
I squeezed through the back door and made my escape
I ran and got my .38 I hope it's not too late!


(I been trying to call you all day motherfucker where you at?)
I'm on 7 Mile {*gunfire*} what the fuck was that?
{*gunfire*} Damn, somebody hit me from the back!
(What with they car?)With a gat nigga, and my tire flat
{*crash*} And I just hit a pole, them niggas some hoes
(Is you hit?) I don't know, but I can tell you what they drove
It was a black Mitsubishi (Shit, that's the clique we beefing with)
Maaaaan! (I swear) And I was on my way there
Believe me, I'm leaving a carcass today
And I'mma park my car and walk the rest of the way
I'm in the mood to strut, my AK ain't even tucked
I'mma meet you at the club, we gon' fuck these hoes up!


I never seen no shit like this in my life before
People are still camped out from the night before
Sleeping outside the door, waiting in line still
Trying to get inside the club to see D12 perform
The fire marshals know, the venue's too small
People are wall to wall, three thousand and some odd
Fans and some cumwad from out the parking lot
Gets in an argument over a parking spot
Decides to pull his gun and lets a few of them off
Missed who he's aiming for, six feet away is the door
Into St. Andrew's Hall, now the strays flying all over the place
Grazed one bitch in the face
Another one of 'em came through the wall
Before anyone could even hear the first shot go off
I'm posted up at the bar, having a mazeltov
Bullet whizzed right by my ear, damn near shot it off
Thank God I'm alive, I gotta find Denaun
And where the fuck is Von? He usually tucks one on him
Wait a minute, I think I just saw Bizarre
Nah I guess not, what the fuck? Oh my God, it was!
I never saw him run so fast in my life
Look at him hauling ass, I think he left his wife
There she is, on the ground, being trampled
I go to grab her up by the damn hand, but I can't pull her
{*blam*} God damn, there just went another damn bullet
I'm hit, my vest is barely able to handle it
It's too thin, if I get hit again I can't do it
I scoop Dee, follow Bizarre's path, ran through it and
Made it to the front door and collapsed
On the steps looked up and I seen Swift
Shooting it out but I can't see who he's shooting it out with
But Denaun's right behind him, squeezing his four-fifth


Yo, it's Friday night, came to this bitch right
Big ass on my left, hand Desert Eagle in my right
I ain't come in this bitch to party, I came in this bitch to fight
Although I can't stay here to fight cause I'm popping niggas tonight
That's right bitches I'm drunk with revenge
Shot a bouncer in the neck for trying to check when I get in
Swift told me to meet him here, so it's clear that the schmuck
That shot out the back of his truck is up in this motherfucker
So one shot for the money, two is to stop the show
The third's for the bartender (bitch bring me a bottle of Mo')
I just wanna know who driving the black Mitsubishi?
He tried to run, so Proof shot him in the knee with a three-piece

You know, critics, man
Critics never got nothing nice to say, man
You know the one thing I notice about critics, man, is
Critics never ask me how my day went
Well Imma tell 'em ...

Yesterday my dog died, I hog tied a ho, tied her in a bow
Said "next time you blog, try to spit a flow"
You wanna criticize, dog? Try a little mo'
I'm so tired of this I could blow fire in the hole
I'm fired up so fire up the lighter and the dro
Better hold on a little tighter here I go
Flows tighter, hot headed as Ghost Rider
Cold hearted as Spiderman throwing a spider in the snow
So you better get lower than Flo-rida
Inside of a lowrider with no tires in the hole
Why am I like this? Why is winter cold?
Why is it when I talk I'm so biased to the hoes
Listen dog, Christmas is off, this is as soft as it gets
This isn't golf this is a blistering assault
Those are your wounds this is the salt, so get lost
Shit dissing me is just like pissing off the Wizard of Oz
Wrap a lizard in gauze beat you in the jaws with it
Grab the scissors and saws and cut out your livers gizzards and balls
Throw you in the middle of the ocean in the blizzard with Jaws
So sip piss like sizzurp through a straw
Then describe how it tasted like dessert to us all
Got the gall to make Chris piss in his drawers
Tickle him, go to his grave, skip him and visit his dog

You're on fire

Thats how you know you're on a roll
Cause when you hot its like your burning up everyone else's cold
You're on fire
Man I'm so fucking sick I got ambulances pulling me over and shit
You're on fire
You need to stop drop and roll
Cause when you say the shit to get the whole Hip Hop Shop to blow
You're on fire, you're on fire

I just put a bullshit hook in between two long ass verses
If you mistook this for a song, look
This ain't a song its a warning to Brooke Hogan and David Cook
That the crook just took over so book
Run as fast as you can, stop writing and kill it
I'm lightning in a skillet you're a fucking flash in a pan
I pop up you bitches scatter like hot grease splashing a fan
Mr. Mathers is the man
Yeah I'm pissed but I would rather take this energy and stash it in a can
Come back and whip your ass with it again
Saliva's like sulfuric acid in your hand
It'll eat through anything metal, the ass of Iron Man
Turn him into plastic
So for you to think that you could stand a fucking chance is asinine
Yeah, ask Denaun man
Hit a blind man with a coloring book and told him color inside the lines
Or get hit with a flyin crayon, fuck it I ain't playing
Pull up in a van and hop out at a homeless man
Holding a sign saying: Vietnam vet, I'm out my fucking mind man
Kick over the can, beat his ass, and leave him 9 grand
So if I seem a little mean to you
This ain't savage you ain't never seen a brute
You want to get graphic we can go the scenic route
You couldn't make a bulimic puke
On a piece of fucking corn and peanut poop
Saying you sick, quit playing you prick don't nobody care
And why the fuck am I yelling at air
I ain't even talking to no one cause ain't nobody there
Nobody will fucking test me cause these hoes won't even dare
I'm wasting punchlines but I got so many to spare
I just thought of another one that might go here
Naw don't waste it save it psycho yeah
Plus you got to rewrite those lines that you said about Michael's hair


Hey yo, what's up man? Hey, yo you been here all day man
Ya'll been here every weekend man
I don't ever get a chance to rap first man!
That's cause you wack!
What?!? I ain't wack nigga, I got some raps for all ya'll
Nigga my raps fresh, I'mma bust my raps first
You can bust yours after me if you want to
No no man, I'm going first
I'm getting tired of everybody wanted to go first man
You always rap first
I'm rapping I don't care what none of ya'll say
I'm fresh, I'm fresh

Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Point him out man I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
(scratched in) I wanna know, I wanna know
I said who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Point him out bitch I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
(scratched in) I wanna know, I wanna know

I'll have you thinking back to Christ when you're sacrificed
The way you're hacked and sliced when I fill your back with knifes
Jacking life's of MCs, now I'm set to launch a plan
For blowing up the stage with illegal contraband
I stomped your man so unless you want what he got
You better set the mic down, I'm steaming like a teapot
I'll make the D hot, people get in my face and ask
If I wanna battle, then I chase them in a Jason mask
It's an amazing task to battle with success
I never gave a fuck, now I give a fuck less
And in a slug fest I get physical like physicians
Invisible like magicians with mystical mic traditions
Wicked wizardry like a sorcerer, no remorse for you
When I torture you throughout the course of my orchestra
So feel the force of my spiritual images
Slicing up an enemy's appendages till he hemorrhages
My skin itches every time a rapper recites
And when he's through with his verse, I'm all covered in flea bites
You wanna see fights I got a match for you
You couldn't flip shit playing in toilets with a spatula


You bitches get a hysterectomy disrespecting me
You wanna feel the full effect of me, hand a tech to me
Intellectually superior, I'll make the whack wearier
Inferior, deteriorate, like bacteria
Materially, killing serially, clearly you'll see
How much in fear when you hear me you'll be
Shiver and shake, quiver and quake
Bite a rhyme feel your jaw get stiffer and ache, whither and break
You slithering snake, gibbering fake, fibbering flake
I'll twist you into a different shape
And toss you in Michigan Lake, for fisherman sake
If this is a dream you'd wish you can wake
Every diss you can take, personal
We ain't friends trying to make amends
If you ain't ever stole a gate you can take offense
I make intense masterpieces and smash to pieces
Your last releases, you pass diseases, that's the reason
I'm showing you the proper way to operate a mic
So pass it like a hot potato
I've never been less than clever and fresh
Severing flesh of fools who never impressed I can confess


Whhhooo the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Point him out!! I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
(scratched in) I wanna know, I wanna know
Ayo let me get that mic man
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Who the fuck passed you the mic, who the fuck passed you the mic!!
I got the rhymes bitch, I'll kick that shit[Kuniva]
Check my vocals, cause you know what I'm about
It's best to play like O.J. Simpson and I just stab out
Why did you enter? You didn't comprehend
See this is a battle for MCs who think they might win
But fuck the battle, let's take it to the streets
Cause you a pussy, oh well, if you are what you eat
Now you can go get your crew ? you now
? me wrong ? and all this shit gon be blew out
Claiming you jumped ?
Nigga you come in this bitch, you talk more shit than Reggie Miller
Never spent nothing more, nothing less
The first single that you drop is "I wanna be fresh"

Any rapper sayin' those kind of rhymes
In this day and age, in this period of time
Trying to battle Eminem is worse than David Starr
Trying to battle Proof, Eye-Kyu, B-Flat, Bizarre
? that's why you beg to differ me
You ain't got no style plus you lack delivery
Not to brag, I don't mean to boast
Look, my face is pale, but you look like you seen a ghost
You're that bitch, you couldn't slip up in the zone
If I put banana peels around this fucking microphone
So get a bull dozer, start from bottom to top
And take this building down cause that's the only way you're wrecking shop[Intro: Eminem]
Here's the story, of a little boy
Growing up in a suburban home
Trying to cope with everyday life
Who lives in a little house
That was built, in the middle of the street

"Hey, Mom! 2Pac's on the jukebox"
"So what, he shot two cops
And raped a little girl while two dudes watched"
"Nuh-uh! They were tryin' to frame him"
"You and that Tupack Shaker..."
"No! That ain't how you say his name, mom!
You're so lame, don't you know anything?"
"Yeah! I know that you'll probably go and join in a gang,"
"Yeah, right. I'm out. Where's my fuckin' Walkman at?"
"Stop cussin' at me!"
"Shut up, bitch!"
"Quit talking Black!"
Well, slammed the door and I'm out
Now, what? It's probably warm in the house
Fuck, I forgot my jacket, forgot it was winter
I'm gettin' thinner, I'm hungry
Is Mom cookin' dinner?
"Mom! Let me back in! I forgot my coat
Mom, come on, I'm not playin', it's cold!
Alright, sorry, I need a jacket
Mom, look, my 2Pac tape, I just cracked it
Ma, please let me back in
It is Tupack Shaker, I just asked him"
I'm freezin', I'm sneezin'
I'm breathin' too much cold air, I'm wheezin'
"I ain't did nothin' I didn't say 'I'm leavin'"
I said "I'm goin' on the front porch to get somethin'"
(scissors cutting) "Alright, here take your damn coat and leave,"
"Fine, I'll le— Mom, you cut off the sleeves!"

Our house
In the middle of the street

One, two, three
My teacher's two-faced, went to lower all my school grades
Since last Tuesday I had a toothache from Kool-Aid
So Mom kicked me out, and all I had in my suitcase
Was one shoelace, a tube sock, and a tube of toothpaste
Sometimes it was cool cause I could go to Fred's
Crash there, fool around and just skip school
But other times I'd rather just be home
In my own room alone beat my shit and nobody would know
My little brother sucked on a bottle 'til he was six
So I'd hide it inside the couch and say
"I don't know where it is"
But as soon as Mom found it I would either be grounded
Or kicked out of the house a thousand weeks and still countin'
Even when I was underage
Mom was tellin' cops I was tryin' to run away
I told her "Someday, bitch, you're gonna pay"
Please, Mom, please, Mom, please, I wanna stay
(Let me stay)


My brother's incoherent, Mom's a single parent
Who ain't carin', starin' through me
Like I'm transparent, made it clear
That I was just there to run her errands
Told her friends I was a son from her last marriage
Sent me up to the corner store with a little note
"Please, sell my step-son some cigarettes so I can smoke"
One time I tried to fake sick to get attention
Back-fired, Mom sent me to school with a vengeance
My life's the worst thing that could ever happen to me
I go to class and every teacher's always laughin' at me
And Mom says white rappers are laughed at
Not only that, she heard me upstairs
I can't rap, and I'm stupid
I'll never make it averaging a D+
I need to sit on my ass and sue people like she does
One time, I got food poison from a hot dog
Mom sued and got $2,000 from Ballpark
"Hey, Ma. You got a dollar?"
"I don't think so, now keep an eye on your brother
I'm goin' to bingo."
"But, Mom, you said you were broke."
"Who said? You got your ears messed up
From that damn rap music."

EMINEM YOU FUCKING BITCH







I[Hook]
I am phenomenal
With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal
I am phenomenal
However long that it takes
I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal
But I'll never say, ‘Oh, it’s impossible’
Cause I'm born to be phenomenal

Unstoppable, unpoppable thought bubbles
Untoppable thoughts, fuckin' juggernaut that'll
Stomp you in a verse, obstacles I'm drawn to 'em
When the going got rough
Some of what I done fought through was the worst, little sissy
Who the fuck taught you how to persevere?
There ain't no situation that you ever had to respond to that's adverse
The messiest thing you've ever gone through was your purse
Yeah, I don't try like hell, then I might as well
Hang it up like a shelf, gotta keep growin' with it, evolve
Cause you can keep throwin' shit at the wall
But you're gonna find that nothing's gonna stick until you apply yourself
Time to slip in that zone 'til I find myself
Inside the realm of the unknown and boldly go
Into waters where nobody else has gone before
Or willing to go, uncharted, feeling is so
Bomb, I'm feelin' myself, I'm a giant
Sometimes I gotta remind myself that I am...

I am phenomenal
With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal
I am phenomenal
However long that it takes
I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal
But I'll never say, ‘Oh, it’s impossible’
Cause I'm born to be phenomenal

Let me self-empower you
When you're down and they're tryin' to clown the fuck out of you
And you feel like you're runnin' out of fuel
I'll show you how to use doubt as fuel
Convert it to gunpowder too
Now what you do is put the match to the charcoal fluid
Put the spark to it like Martha Stewart barbecuing
Ah screw it, feel like you want to hit that wall then do it
Punch through it, just cock back, put your all into it
Now you gon' take that rage and make that what you wage
Never take back what you say
If you stay strapped in your brain, engaged in a steel cage match
Ready to scrap asap
Take your fists and just ball it
Show who's big and who's smallest you're Christopher Wallace
Now picture 'em all as plastic and foam
Lays flat, where you put your dinner plates at
And set it on 'em like a placemat
(I am phenomenal)
And I want you to say that

I am phenomenal
With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal
I am phenomenal
However long that it takes
I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal
But I'll never say, ‘Oh, it’s impossible’
Cause I'm born to be phenomenal

Oh, step into the unknown and find yourself
You’re floating freely, no emotion

Got a fuckin’ mouth with no shut-off valve
Can't even cut off power to it, but it's what allowed
Me to come up out from under the fuckin' ground
Cause I worked my butt off now
It's a subject that I don't know how to shut up about
Cause I stuck it out
Like a motherfuckin' tongue thats how
I responded when I got shoved around
You're gonna have non-believers
But when you're beyond belief, you probably shouldn't wonder how
Get it how you live
But are you prepared to give more than you get?
And put in twice what you get back from this shit
Though what you sacrifice barely is half, never give
Rap is my shiv
But it's like my shield at the same time I wield and my knife is will
Sometimes I feel just like B. Real from Cypress Hill
How I can just kill a cypher, survivor's guilt
I rhyme like life is still an uphill climb
Ready to face any challenge, waitin'
Can taste it, it's salivation, I'm wagin' retaliation
Look what I have built, reputation is validation
The only thing I'm capable of makin' is amazing
Only thing you're capable of makin' is a false statement
Or accusation... I am legendary status, in fact
That is the only way you'll ever be able to say
You're a legend is makin' an allegation
I write with the left, same hand I hold the mic with
As I fight to the death, 'til my last breath
Manage to prove who the best man is
Prevail at all costs, be the only ones left standin'
In the end, but I ain't gonna be the only one with the advantage
Of knowin' what it's like to be southpaw
Cause you can bet your ass you'll be left handed
Cause I am

I am phenomenal
With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal
I am phenomenal
However long that it takes
I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal
But I'll never say, ‘Oh, it’s impossible’
Cause I'm born to be phenomenal[Nakarat]
Ben olağanüstüyüm
Kanımın her bir parçasına kadar
Akciğerlerimdeki her bir nefese kadar
Olağanüstü olana kadar durmayacağım
Ben olağanüstüyüm
Ne kadar uzun sürse de
Ne olursa olsun yapacağım
Bu beni bir canavar yapsa bile
Ben olağanüstüyüm
Ama hiçbir zaman "Bu imkansız." demeyeceğim
Çünkü olağanüstü olmak için doğmuşum

Durdurulamaz, patlatılamaz düşünce balonları
Yenilemeyen düşünceler, ezici bir güç
Seni bir verse'de ezerim ve önüne engeller koyarım
Yollar sertleştiğinde
Benim düşündüğüm şeylerin daha kötü olduğunu gösteririm, küçük kaşar
Size sonuna kadar direnmeyi kim öğretti amk?
Senin olumsuzluğa karşı koyman gereken bir durumun olmadı
Hayatında karşılaşabileceğin en büyük zorluk anca maddi sorunlarındır
Evet, Kaptan gibi denemiyorum ama
Bunları rafa kaldırıp, büyümeye ve evrimleşmeye devam etmem lazım
Çünkü duvara bok atıp durabilirsin ama
Sen kendini vermediğin sürece hiç birinin yapışmayacağını öğreneceksin
Kendimi bulana kadar yine havama girme zamanı geldi
Alemin içine, daha önce kimsenin gitmediği veya gitmek istemediği yerlere
Girmediği sulara girmeye hazırım, keşfedilmemiş yerlere
Bomba gibi hissediyorum
Kendime güveniyorum, ben bir devim
Bazen kendime şunu hatırlatmam gerekiyor...

Ben olağanüstüyüm
Kanımın her bir parçasına kadar
Akciğerlerimdeki her bir nefese kadar
Olağanüstü olana kadar durmayacağım
Ben olağanüstüyüm
Ne kadar uzun sürse de
Ne olursa olsun yapacağım
Bu beni bir canavar yapsa bile
Ben olağanüstüyüm
Ama hiçbir zaman "Bu imkansız." demeyeceğim
Çünkü olağanüstü olmak için doğmuşum

Kendini güçlendirmene yardım etmeme izin ver
Dibe çöktüğünde ve insanlar seni yoksaydığında
Yakıtın bitmiş gibi hissettiğinde
İnsanların senden duyduğu şüpheyi yakıt olarak nasıl kullanacağını göstereceğim
Bunu senin barutuna çevireceğim
Şimdi yapman gereken şey sadece kömür sıvısına kibrit yakmak
Martha Stewart barbekü yaparkenki gibi kıvılcım koy
Ah siktir et, duvara vurmak istiyormuş gibi hissediyorsan, o zaman yap hadi
Sadece gücünü topla ve tam ortasına vur
Şimdi, o öfkeyi alacaksın ve bunu paranı kazandığın şey yapacaksın
Söylediğin şeyleri asla geri almayacaksın
Eğer beyninin içinde kapana kısılırsan
Bu kafes dövüşünde kullan bunu
Hemen dövüşmeye hazır ol
Yumruklarını onun kemiklerine geçir
Biggie'ye kimin küçük olduğunu göster, sen Christopher Wallece'sın
Evet ben düşmanlarımı plastik ve köpük gibi hayal ediyorum
Onları dümdüz ediyorum, yemek tabaklarını koyduğunuz yere
Ve servis altlığı gibi hepsini yok ediyorum
(Ben olağanüstüyüm)
Ve şunu söylemenizi istiyorum

Ben olağanüstüyüm
Kanımın her bir parçasına kadar
Akciğerlerimdeki her bir nefese kadar
Olağanüstü olana kadar durmayacağım
Ben olağanüstüyüm
Ne kadar uzun sürse de
Ne olursa olsun yapacağım
Bu beni bir canavar yapsa bile
Ben olağanüstüyüm
Ama hiçbir zaman "Bu imkansız." demeyeceğim
Çünkü olağanüstü olmak için doğmuşum

Bilinmeyene adım at
Kendini bul, havada yükseliyorsun, hiç bir duygun yok

Kapatma vanası olmayan sikik bir ağzım var
Ona giden gücü bile kesemiyorum, ama olan şey bu
Yerin altından çıkıp geldiğim için
Çünkü götüm çıkana kadar çalıştım
Ve bu konu susmayı beceremediğim konulardan
Çünkü sonuna kadar gittim
Aynı dilim gibi amk benle uğraşıldığında hepsine cevap verdim
Sana inanmayan insanlar illa ki olacak
Ama sen inancın ötesindeyken, insanların senden neden nefret ettiğini
Düşünmemen lazım
Ama aldığından fazlasını vermeye hazır mısın?
Geri aldığından 2 kat fazlasını vermeye hazır mısın?
Kurban ettiklerin daha onların yarısı olsa bile, asla pes etme
Rap benim kılıcım
Ama aynı zamanda kalkanım, bunu ustalıkla kullanıyorum
Bu iradeyi bıçaklayacağım
Bazen kendimi Cypress Hill'den B. Real gibi hissediyorum
Freestyle'ı nasıl katlettiğim, hayatta kalanın suçu bu
Hala hayat bir yokuşmuş gibi kafiye yapıyorum
Bunlarla yüzleşmeye hazırım, her zorluk beni bekliyor
Tadını alabiliyorum, intikamla mücadele ediyorum
Yarattığım şeye bak, şöhret aynı zamanda yetki vermektir
Yapabildiğim şeyler harikalıklardan ibaret
Senin yapabildiğin şeyler ise anca yanlış ifadelerden ibaret
Ve suçlamalardan... Ben efsaneleşmiş haldeyim, bu bir gerçek
Senin efsane olmak için yapabileceğin tek şey beni suçlaman!
Sol elimle yazıyorum, mikrofonu tuttuğum elim de aynı
Ölene kadar savaşırken, son nefesime kadar
Kimin en iyisi olduğunu kanıtladım
Sadece ben kalana kadar alttaki insanları denetleyeceğim
Ama solak olmanın avantajlarını bilen sadece ben olmayacağım
Çünkü emin olabilirsin ki eline verilmiş bir şekilde bırakılacaksın
Çünkü ben....

Ben olağanüstüyüm
Kanımın her bir parçasına kadar
Akciğerlerimdeki her bir nefese kadar
Olağanüstü olana kadar durmayacağım
Ben olağanüstüyüm
Ne kadar uzun sürse de
Ne olursa olsun yapacağım
Bu beni bir canavar yapsa bile
Ben olağanüstüyüm
Ama hiçbir zaman "Bu imkansız." demeyeceğim
Çünkü olağanüstü olmak için doğmuşumI'm ice grilling you, staring you down with a gremlin grin
I'm Eminem, you're a fag in a women's gym
I'm Slim, cause Shady is really a fake alias
To save me with in case I get chased by space aliens
A brainiac with a cranium packed full of more uranium
Than a maniac Saudi Arabian
A highly combustible head, spasmodic
Strapped to a Craftmatic adjustable bed
Laid up in a hospital in critical condition
I flat lined, jumped up and ran from the mortician
High speed, IV full of Thai-weed
Looking Chinese with my knee's, stuck together like Siamese
Twins, joined at the groin like lesbians
Pins and needles, hypodermic needles and pins
I hope god forgives me for my sins
It probably all depends on if I keep on killing my girlfriends[Eminem]
Yo yo, back again
Ha-ha-ha (Agh!)
Turn it up a little bit, pick it up pick it up
Yo pick it up, pick it up
Yo pick it up
If you find a phone call in a Tim Westwood line, what the hell you gonna do?
Pick it up! Pick it up!

If your ball falls out with a pad on the floor, what the hell you gonna do? (Pick it up! Pick it up!)

While I'm smacking up girls to keep the hoes in check
The double S-Slim Shady wreck the London set
Sit back and relax while my squad smokes crack
And tap your man back and be like (Did you see that?)
Ah yes, coming from the mother freaking Midwest
Lift your shirt up and let me see them big breasts
We molest girls three times a day, three times a night
I got G-fulls of criminal peoples
Jumping out when we ten deep
Beat you down and speed off in a Benz Jeep
Brothers be like: Eminem changed his style up!
Shut the hell up, I'm still seven miles slut!
It's '97 so get with it
Peep that back in the day stuff when that Infinite tape was hitting
Listen, must we forget
I originated all that rough shit, that talk drug shit
That left motherfuckers who said our sound like [?]
Detroit city is where I grew up bitch
Peace to all my Outsidaz in Jers
Forget what you heard, this is three and one third

If you got an STD and your penis falls on the floor (What the hell you gonna do?)
Pick it up! Pick it up! (Ahhh yeah yeah yeahhh pick it up, pick it up)
If you see a Slim Shady tape on the fucking rack
What does Dre do? (ooohhhh)
(On the uckin rack, on the uck without the f)

I get deaf MCees stepped to the left
I bust MCees and my name is Wyclef
How you doing? I play the banjo, piano whatever it is I rock like Barry Manilow
Yo it's Slim Shady on the freaking deck
Y'all don't check it out I wreck the Frim Shady set
The Frim Shady is what I said because I'm freaking drunk
I pick it up, pick it up, I sound like a punk

Ayo they wish that they could ban me black
Yo, you standing back
Def methods, ayo got my hand in that
Who ever running it, ayo you get a jammed knee cap
Make the healthiest in your fam, handicap
You a fan of rap, my clan will tap your school, home, ya bitch house
Pull my nine millie, you gonna die with your fist out
Enemas is over with
Venomous is cobra spit
Aggressive dialect with aggressive sober pitch
My bionic phonics, demolish your logic, demonic can't stand the chronic impossible to hold on like vomit
Mics I palm it, cause they the bomb-it
Like terrorist is Islamic, I enter your atmosphere like a comet
The new god of rap, call me bigger Thor
Snap your back when I slap your ass in a figure four
From miles around they can feel us lethal
I make hardcore groups like Wu Tang sound like the village people (haha)
Be no sequel, of the energize, finish style, bust 'em down right now, the winner is... me
Then my man Mr. Paul we gonna star
Make your heart beat for your trying get down with us
We ball to the end, it's time to pretend
My friend to the left of me, the death of me
Me recipe to be with this don't even test MCees
Y'all can't get with us it's the dress, dress on ya[Verse 1: Chaos Kid]
Get up this morning, I'm feeling sleepy as hell
Went to use the bathroom when I tripped and I fell
All the way downstairs onto the couch
And I pissed my pants on the way down south
So I went back upstairs to change my underwear
Took a while to get em unstuck from my pubic hair
Finally got unzipped I went to put em down the street
But then I threw em in the garbage cause it all said pew
Hopped in the shower put shampoo in my hair
Went to rinse it out but then the water wasn't there
That damn toilet it must of went foul
Got another bath to wipe the stuff up with the towel
Went to get my clothes but I couldn't wear the wash
So I sat and played some Mario on my Nintendo
I was gonna see my girl but I forget that stuff man today
I just feel like a pooh butt...

Sometimes things just never go my way
You know I'm just feeling like a pooh butt today

Now every single day I make habits to get up
But today I just feel like a pooh butt so ill stay in bed
I dont know whats wrong with me, I'm just taking everything nonchalantly
I just feel like I can't move one muscle
My girlfriend calls me up and tells me now we gotta hustle
My plane leaves to roll about quarter to 8
It's 7:15 looks like I'm gonna be late
Aww forget that baby said I just can't make it
I know you're disappointed but your gonna have to take it
I'm sick in bed I'm making [?] foot it but before hung up the phone she told me where I could put it
Comes next day I got a call from M&M he said
(We gotta make a record get ya butt outta bed) I said I ain't doin nothing I wish you nothing but luck he said (What's up?) I said I feel like a pooh but...

Sometimes things just never go my way you know i, im just feelin like a pooh butt today

(Chaos Kid) "yo you ever have one of those poohie stinky ridiculous rotten days, M&M" (M&M) "man I had one once check this out"

Woke up, 6:30 in the morning, yawning
Gotta get to the recording studio
I gotta get a take done
Put all my rhymes together so I can make one
Get outta bed, fall on my head
Slipped on the rug, I thought I was dead
Cussin', I think my head is busted but it's really nothing
Only a concussion, shake it off, get off the ground
Look around couldn't find my rhyme sheets; Where'd I put em down?
They were just there last night on the chair
Had to look everywhere but couldn't find em anywhere
Go to the basement might of misplaced em
Gotta find em in hurry but my visions still blurry
Goin' down the stairs what could happen next
But, when its this early you can't skip steps;
Fallin head first -- As I fall, I curse
Things are lookin' bad, I'mma only get worse;
Aching I shake and I hurt I stand up slowly
Wiped all the dirt off memory lapse
I can't remember nothing, think I'll collapse
If you forget the whole thing pause for a second
What was I looking for? Oh yeah, my rhyme sheets
They might be on the floor or on the chair
Wait a minute where am I? I'm in a basement
Damn, how does time fly? Think for a second
Record my memory if I were a rhyme sheet where would I be??
Now I remember I put em in the closet next to my jacket
So I woulda never lost em
Already seven, I've only got an hour to eat breakfast
Get dressed, plus take a shower got undressed
Got the zest off the rack
Turn the water on and I almost had a heart attack;
Cold as hell, started to yell jumped out the shower
And said fuck it, I'll smell
Grabbed the towel off the rack, dried off got dressed
Still had to eat but my hair was a mess
I was in a rush, grabbed the brush
And ran into the door on the floor I land
Always to fate now; I know I'm cursed
I think it might help if I open the door first
Tried to turn the handle but I sprained my wrist
But that's what happens on a day like this...

Sometimes things just never go my way
You know I'm just feelin' like a pooh butt today

(Chaos Kid): Wow, that sounds pretty poohie to me

(M&M): Now, I'm gonna break it downfor those who don't know what a pooh butt day is

Now, a pooh butt day is something everybody's had
No particular depression neither mad or sad
You couldn't see your butt because your butt is what it is
Cause when your feeling like a pooh butt
Then you're feeling like shit
