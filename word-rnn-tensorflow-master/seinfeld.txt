JERRY

(pointing at George's shirt) See, to me, that button is in the worst possible spot. The second button literally makes or breaks the shirt, look at it. It's too high! It's in no-man's-land. You look like you live with your mother. 

GEORGE

Are you through?  

JERRY

You do of course try on, when you buy? 

GEORGE

Yes, it was purple, I liked it, I don't actually recall considering the buttons. 

JERRY

Oh, you don't recall? 

GEORGE

(on an imaginary microphone) Uh, no, not at this time. 

JERRY

Well, senator, I'd just like to know, what you knew and when you knew it. 

CLAIRE

Mr. Seinfeld. Mr. Costanza.  

GEORGE

Are, are you sure this is decaf? Where's the orange indicator? 

CLAIRE

It's missing, I have to do it in my head: decaf left, regular right, decaf left, regular right...it's very challenging work. 

JERRY

Can you relax, it's a cup of coffee. Claire is a professional waitress. 

CLAIRE

Trust me George. No one has any interest in seeing you on caffeine. 

GEORGE

How come you're not doin' the second show tomorrow? 

JERRY

Well, there's this uh, woman might be comin' in. 

GEORGE

Wait a second, wait a second, what coming in, what woman is coming in? 

JERRY

I told you about Laura, the girl I met in Michigan? 

GEORGE

No, you didn't! 

JERRY

I thought I told you about it, yes, she teaches political science? I met her the night I did the show in Lansing...  

GEORGE

Ha. 

JERRY

(looks in the creamer) There's no milk in here, what... 

GEORGE

Wait wait wait, what is she... (takes the milk can from Jerry and puts it on the table) What is she like? 

JERRY

Oh, she's really great. I mean, she's got like a real warmth about her and she's really bright and really pretty and uh... the conversation though, I mean, it was... talking with her is like talking with you, but, you know, obviously much better. 

GEORGE

(smiling) So, you know, what, what happened? 

JERRY

Oh, nothing happened, you know, but is was great. 

GEORGE

Oh, nothing happened, but it was... 

JERRY

Yeah. 

GEORGE

This is great! 

JERRY

Yeah. 

GEORGE

So, you know, she calls and says she wants to go out with you tomorrow night? God bless! Devil you! 

JERRY

Yeah, well...not exactly. I mean, she said, you know, she called this morning and said she had to come in for a seminar and maybe we'll get together.  

GEORGE

(whistles disapprovingly) Ho ho ho, 'Had to'? 'Had to' come in? 

JERRY

Yeah, but... 

GEORGE

'Had to come in' and 'maybe we'll get together'? 'Had to' and 'maybe'? 

JERRY

Yeah! 

GEORGE

No...no...no, I hate to tell you this. You're not gonna see this woman. 

JERRY

What, are you serious...why, why did she call? 

GEORGE

How do I know, maybe, you know, maybe she wanted to be polite.  

JERRY

To be polite? You are insane! 

GEORGE

All right, all right, I didn't want to tell you this. You wanna know why she called you? 

JERRY

Yes! 

GEORGE

You're a back-up, you're a second-line, a just-in-case, a B-plan, a contingency! 

JERRY

Oh, I get it, this is about the button. 

GEORGE

Claire, Claire, you're a woman, right? 

CLAIRE

What gave it away, George? 

GEORGE

Uhm...I'd like to ask you...ask you to analyze a hypothetical phone call, you know, from a female point of view. 

GEORGE

(to Claire) Now, a woman calls me, all right?  

CLAIE

Uh huh. 

GEORGE

She says she 'has to' come to New York on business... 

JERRY

Oh you are beautiful! 

GEORGE

...and, and 'maybe' she'll see me when she gets there, does this woman intend to spend time with me? 

CLAIRE

I'd have to say, uuhh, no.  

CLAIRE

To be polite. 

GEORGE

To be polite. I rest my case. 

JERRY

Good. Did you have fun? You have no idea, what you're talking about, now, come on, come with me. (stands up) I gotta go get my stuff out of the dryer anyway. 

GEORGE

I'm not gonna watch you do laundry. 

JERRY

Oh, come on, be a come-with guy. 

GEORGE

Come on, I'm tired. 

CLAIRE

(to Jerry) Don't worry, I gave him a little caffeine. He'll perk up. 

GEORGE

(panicking) Right, I knew I felt something! 

GEORGE

Jerry? I have to tell you something. This is the dullest moment I've ever experienced.  

JERRY

Well, look at this guy. Look, he's got everything, he's got detergents, sprays, fabric softeners. This is not his first load. 

GEORGE

I need a break, Jerry, you know. I gotta get out of the city. I feel so cramped... 

JERRY

And you didn't even hear how she sounded. 

GEORGE

What?! 

JERRY

Laura. 

GEORGE

I can't believe- (falls on his knees) WE ALREADY DISCUSSED THIS! 

JERRY

Yeah, but how could you be so sure? 

GEORGE

'Cause it's signals, Jerry, it's signals! (snapping his fingers) Don't you- all right. Did she even ask you, what you were doin' tomorrow night, if you were busy? 

JERRY

No. 

GEORGE

She calls you today and she doesn't make a plan for tomorrow? What is that? It's Saturday night! 

JERRY

Yeah. 

GEORGE

What is that? It's ridiculous! You don't even know what hotel she's staying at, you can't call her. That's a signal, Jerry, that's a signal! (snaps his fingers) Signal! 

JERRY

Maybe you're right. 

GEORGE

Maybe I'm right? Of course I'm right. 

JERRY

This is insane. You know, I don't even know where she's staying! She, she's not gonna call me, this is unbelievable. 

GEORGE

I know, I know. Listen, your stuff has to be done by now, why don't you just see if it's dry? 

JERRY

No no no, don't interrupt the cycle. The machine is working, it, it knows what it's doing. Just let it finish. 

GEORGE

You're gonna overdry it. 

JERRY

You, you can't overdry. 

GEORGE

Why not? 

JERRY

Same as you can't overwet. You see, once something is wet, it's wet. Same thing with death. Like once you die you're dead, right? Let's say you drop dead and I shoot you. You're not gonna die again, you're already dead. You can't overdie, you can't overdry. 

GEORGE

(to the other laundry patrons) Any questions? 

JERRY

How could she not tell me where she was staying?  

GEORGE

Look at that. They're done!  

JERRY

Laundry day is the only exciting day in the life of clothes. It is...y'know, think about it. The washing machine is the nightclub of clothes. You know, it's dark, there's bubbles happening, they're all kinda dancing around in there- shirt grabs the underwear, 'C'mon babe, let's go'. You come by, you open up the lid and they'll- (stiffens up, as the clothes) Socks are the most amazing article of clothing. They hate their lives, they're in the shoes with stinky feet, the boring drawers. The dryer is their only chance to escape and they all know it. They knew a escape from the dryer. They plan it in the hamper the night before, 'Tomorrow, the dryer, I'm goin'. You wait here!' The dryer door swings open and the sock is waiting up against the side wall. He hopes you don't see him and then he goes down the road. They get buttons sewn on their faces, join a puppet show. So they're showing me on television the detergent for getting out bloodstains. Is this a violent image to anybody? Bloodstains? I mean, come on, you got a T-shirt with bloodstains all over it, maybe laundry isn't your biggest problem right now. You gotta get the harpoon out your chest first.  

JERRY

(answering, quickly) If you know what happened in the Met game, don't say anything, I taped it, hello. Yeah, no, I'm sorry, you have the wrong number. Yeah, no  

JERRY

(to the door) Yeah? 

KESSLER

Are you up? 

JERRY

(to Kessler) Yeah. (to the phone) Yeah, people do move. Have you ever seen the big trucks out on the street? Yeah, no problem. 

KESSLER

Boy, the Mets blew it tonight, huh?  

JERRY

(upset) Ohhhh, what are you doing? Kessler, it's a tape! I taped the game, it's one o'clock in the morning! I avoided human contact all night to watch this. 

KESSLER

Hey, I'm sorry, I- you know, I, I thought you knew. (takes two loaves of bread out of his pockets, and holds them out to Jerry.) You got any meat? 

JERRY

Meat? I don't, I don't know, go... hunt! (Kessler opens the refrigerator and sticks his head in.) Well what happened in the game anyway? 

KESSLER

(from the refrigerator) What happened? Well, they STUNK, that's what happened! 

KESSLER

You know, I almost wound up going to that game. 

JERRY

(cynical) Yeah you almost went to the game. You haven't been out of the building in ten years! 

KESSLER

Yeah. (Jerry sits down on the couch. Kessler walks over with his sandwich and looks at Jerry and uses expressions to ask Jerry to move the newspapers on the other side of the couch so he could site down. Kessler sits down next to him and starts turning over the pages of a magazine. Suddenly he spots an article he likes and tears it out. Jerry gives him a look as if to say, 'Do you mind?') Are you done with this? 

JERRY

No. 

KESSLER

When you're done, let me know. 

JERRY

Yeah, yeah...you can have it tomorrow. 

KESSLER

I thought I wasn't allowed to be in here this weekend. 

JERRY

No, it's okay now, that, that girl is not comin'. Uh, I misread the whole thing. 

KESSLER

You want me to talk to her? 

JERRY

I don't think so. 

KESSLER

Oh, I can be very persuasive. Do you know that I was almost... a lawyer. 

JERRY

That close, huh? 

KESSLER

You better believe it. 

JERRY

Hello...Oh, hi, Laura. 

KESSLER

Oh, give me it...let me talk to her. 

JERRY

(to the phone) No believe me, I'm always up at this hour. How are you?... Great... Sure... What time does the plane get in?... I got my friend George to take me... 

KESSLER

(to the TV) SLIDE! Wow! 

JERRY

No, it's, it's just my neighbour... Um... Yeah, I got it. (Jerry takes a pencil and a cereal box to write on.) Ten-fifteen... No, don't be silly, go ahead and ask... Yeah, sure... Okay, great, no no, it's no trouble at all... I'll see you tomorrow... Great, bye. (He hangs up the phone; to Kessler) I don't believe it. That was her. She wants to stay here!  

JERRY

If my father was moving this he'd had to have a cigarette in his mouth the whole way. (as his father) 'Have you got your end?...Your end's got to come down first, easy now, drop it down...drop it down, your end's got to come down.' 

GEORGE

You know, I can't believe you're bringin' in an extra bed for woman that wants to sleep with you. Why don't you bring in an extra guy too? 

JERRY

Look, it's a very awkward situation. I don't wanna be presumptuous. 

GEORGE

All right, all right, one more time, one more time! What was the exact phrasing of the request? 

JERRY

All right, she said she couldn't find a decent hotel room... 

GEORGE

A decent hotel-room... 

JERRY

Yeah, a decent hotel-room, would it be terribly inconvenient if she stayed at my place. 

GEORGE

You can't be serious. This is New York city. There must be eleven million decent hotel rooms! Whatta you need? A flag? (waving his handkerchief) This is the signal, Jerry, this is the signal!  

JERRY

(cynical) This is the signal? Thank you, Mr. Signal. Where were you yesterday? 

GEORGE

I think I was affected by the caffeine.  

GEORGE

Ho, ho, ho, good dog, good dog... 

KESSLER

Hey, he really likes you, George. 

GEORGE

Well, that's flattering.  

KESSLER

Oh, he's gettin' a drink of water. (pointing to the mattress) Is this for that girl? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

KESSLER

Why even give her an option? 

JERRY

This is a person I like, it's not 'How to score on spring break'. 

GEORGE

Right, can we go? 'Cause I'm double-parked, I'm gonna get a ticket. 

JERRY

Yeah, okay. Oh, wait a second. Oh, I forgot to clean the bathroom. 

GEORGE

So what? That's good. 

JERRY

Now, how could that be good? 

GEORGE

Because filth is good. Whaddaya think, rock stars have sponges and ammonia lyin' around the bathroom? They, have a woman comin' over, 'I've gotta tidy up?' Yeah right, in these matters you never do what your instincts tell you. Always, ALWAYS do the opposite. 

JERRY

This is how you operate? 

GEORGE

Yeah, I wish. 

JERRY

Let me just wipe the sink. 

KESSLER

Why even give her an option for?  

KESSLER

(to George, pointing at the mattress) It's unbelievable. 

GEORGE

Yeah. 

KESSLER

How's the real estate-business? 

GEORGE

(feeling awkward) It's uh, not bad, it's comin' along. Why? Did you need something. 

KRAMER

Do you handle any of that commercial...real estate? 

GEORGE

Well, I might be getting into that. 

KESSLER

(slaps George on the arm) You keep me posted! 

GEORGE

I'm aware of you. (to Jerry) All right, let's go (opens the bathroom door) Let's go! 

JERRY

The dating world is not a fun world...it's a pressure world, it's a world of tension, it's a world of pain...and you know, if a woman comes over to my house, I gotta get that bathroom ready, 'cause she needs things. Women need equipment. I don't know what they need. I know I don't have it, I know that- You know what they need, women seem to need a lot of cotton-balls. This is the one I'm- always has been one of the amazing things to me...I have no cotton-balls, we're all human beings, what is the story? I've never had one...I never bought one, I never needed one, I've never been in a situation, when I thought to myself: 'I could use a cotton-ball right now.' I can certainly get out of this mess. Women need them and they don't need one or two, they need thousands of them, they need bags, they're like peat moss bags, have you ever seen these giant bags? They're huge and two days later, they're out, they're gone, the, the bag is empty, where are the cotton-balls, ladies? What are you doin' with them? The only time I ever see 'em is in the bottom of your little waste basket, there's two or three, that look like they've been through some horrible experience... tortured, interrogated, I don't know what happened to them. I once went out with a girl who's left a little zip-lock-baggy of cotton-balls over at my house. I don't know what to do with them, I took them out, I put them on my kitchen floor like little tumbleweeds. I thought maybe the cockroaches would see it, figure this is a dead town. 'Let's move on.' The dating world is a world of pressure. Let's face it: a date is a job interview that lasts all night. The only difference between a date and a job interview is not many job interviews is there a chance you'll end up naked at the end of it. You know? 'Well, Bill, the boss thinks you're the man for the position, why don't you strip down and meet some of the people you'll be workin' with?'  

JERRY

Wouldn't it be great if you could ask a woman what she's thinking? 

GEORGE

What a world that would be, if you just could ask a woman what she's thinkin'. 

JERRY

You know, instead, I'm like a detective. I gotta pick up clues, the whole thing is a murder investigation. 

GEORGE

Listen, listen, don't get worked up, 'cause you're gonna know the whole story the minute she steps off the plane. 

JERRY

Really? How? 

GEORGE

'Cause it's all in the greeting.  

JERRY

Uh-huh. 

GEORGE

All right, if she puts the bags down before she greets you, that's a good sign. 

JERRY

Right. 

GEORGE

You know, anything in the, in the lip area is good. 

JERRY

Lip area. 

GEORGE

You know a hug: definitely good. 

JERRY

Hug is definitely good. 

GEORGE

Sure. 

JERRY

Although what if it's one of those hugs where the shoulders are touching, the hips are eight feet apart? 

GEORGE

That's so brutal, I hate that. 

JERRY

You know how they do that? 

GEORGE

That's why, you know, a shake is bad. 

JERRY

Shake is bad, but what if it's the two-hander? The hand on the bottom, the hand on the top, the warm look in the eyes? 

GEORGE

Hand sandwich. 

JERRY

Right. 

GEORGE

I see, well, that's open to interpretation. Because so much depends on the layering and the quality of the wetness in the eyes.  

LAURA

Guess who? 

JERRY

Hey, hey. 

JERRY

Heeeey! 

JERRY

It's good to see you. 

LAURA

Hi. 

JERRY

This is my friend George. 

LAURA

Hi, how nice to meet you. 

GEORGE

Hi, how are you? 

JERRY

This is Laura. 

GEORGE

Laura, sure. 

JERRY

(to Laura) I can't believe you're here. 

JERRY

Ooh yeah, the bags, sure.  

LAURA

Oh, thank you. 

JERRY

(aside, to George) Now that was an interesting greeting, did you notice that, George? 

GEORGE

Yes, the surprise blindfold greeting. That wasn't in the manual, I don't know. 

JERRY

So uh, what do you think? 

LAURA

Ooohhh, wow! This place isn't so bad. 

JERRY

Yeah, it kind a motivates me to work on the road. So uh, make yourself at home. (Laura sits down on the couch, takes off her shoes and opens some buttons of her shirt.) So uh, can I get you anything? Uuhhh, bread, water...salad-dressing? 

LAURA

(laughs) Actually, um, do you have any wine? 

JERRY

Uh, yeah, I think I do. 

LAURA

(referring to a lamp) Oh, do you mind if I turn this down? 

JERRY

Uh, no, yeah, go right ahead. 

LAURA

Uh, Jerry, uh, I was wandering, would it be possible ' and if it's not, fine ' for me to stay here tomorrow night too? 

JERRY

Uh, yeah, yeah, sure, why don't you stay? Yeah, uhm...What is your, what is your schedule for tomorrow? Are you, are you doin' anything? 

LAURA

No, I'd love to do something. Uh, I have my seminar in the morning, then after that I'm right open. 

JERRY

Really? What would you like to do? 

LAURA

Well... now I know this sounds touristy, but I'd just love to go on one of those five-hour boat rides around Manhattan. 

JERRY

(unenthusiastic) Yeah, we could do that...why not, why not. (pouring the wine) I'm just, I'm really glad you're here. 

JERRY

(answering) Yeah, hello...yes...yes, she is, hold on. (to Laura) Um, it's for you. 

LAURA

(to the phone) Hello?... Hi!... No no it was great, right on time... No, I, I'm gonna stay here tomorrow...yes, yes it's fine... No, we're goin' on a boat ride... Don't be silly... I'm not gonna have this conversation... Look, I'll call you tomorrow... Okay, bye. (She hangs up the phone.) Never get engaged. 

JERRY

(not excited) You're engaged? 

LAURA

You, you really have no idea what it's like until you actually do it. And I'm on this emotional roller coaster. 

JERRY

You're engaged?  

LAURA

You know, I can't believe it myself sometimes. You have to start thinking in terms of 'we'. Ugh, it's a very stressful situation. 

JERRY

(matter-of-factly) You're engaged.  

LAURA

Yeah, yeah, he's a great guy... 

JERRY

Yeah. 

LAURA

You'd really like him, you know, I can't wait to get on that boat. 

JERRY

Me too! 

JERRY

I swear, I have absolutely no idea what women are thinking. I don't get it, okay? I, I, I admit, I, I'm not getting the signals. I am not getting it! Women, they're so subtle, their little...everything they do is subtle. Men are not subtle, we are obvious. Women know what men want, men know what men want, what do we want? We want women, that's it! It's the only thing we know for sure, it really is. We want women. How do we get them? Oh, we don't know 'bout that, we don't know. The next step after that we have no idea. This is why you see men honking car-horns, yelling from construction sites. These are the best ideas we've had so far. The car-horn honk, is that a beauty? Have you seen men doing this? What is this? The man is in the car, the woman walks by the front of the car, he honks. E-eeehh, eehhh, eehhh! This man is out of ideas. How does it...? E-e-e-eeeehhhh! 'I don't think she likes me.' The amazing thing is, that we still get women, don't we? Men, I mean, men are with women. You see men with women. How are men getting women, many people wonder. Let me tell you a little bit about our organization. Wherever women are, we have a man working on the situation right now. Now, he may not be our best man, okay, we have a lot of areas to cover, but someone from our staff is on the scene. That's why, I think, men get frustrated, when we see women reading articles, like: 'Where to meet men?' We're here, we are everywhere. We're honking our horns to serve you better. 

NOTE

When this episode is shown in syndication, Phil Bruns still plays Jerry's dad (a role later assumed by Barney Martin). 

JERRY

So, I'm on line at the supermarket. Two women in front of me. One of them, her total was eight dollars, the other three dollars. They both of course choose to pay by the use of the... 

AUDIENCE

Cheque. 

JERRY

Cheque. Now, the fact is, if it's a woman in front of you that's writing the cheque, you will not be waiting long. I have noticed that women are very fast with cheques, y'know, 'cause they write out so many cheques. The keys, they can never find in their purse, they don't know where that is, but the cheque book: they got that. They never fumble for the cheque book. The cheque book comes out of a holster: (Jerry 'draws' imaginary book from a holster.) 'Who do I make it out to? There's my ID.' There's something about a cheque that, to a man, is not masculine. I don't know exactly what it is. I think to a man, a cheque is like a note from your mother that says, 'I don't have any money, but if you'll contact these people, I'm sure they'll stick up for me... If you just trust me this one time- I don't have any money but I have these. I wrote on these. Is this of any value at all?' 

JERRY

What's that one? 

ELAINE

'Coccoon II: The Return'. I guess they didn't like it up there. 

JERRY

Maybe they came back for Chinese food. Y'know Maureen Stapleton, if she gets a craving, she's probably screamin' at those aliens, 'I gotta have a lo mein!' 

ELAINE

Okay, what're we doing here? I have seen everything. 

JERRY

Oh yeah? I don't believe you've seen... this. 

ELAINE

Oh, lovely. 

JERRY

Yeah. 

ELAINE

What do you think their parents think? 

JERRY

'So, uh, what's your son doing now, Dr. Stevens?' 'Oh, he's a public fornicator. Yes, he's a fine boy...' 

ELAINE

Y'know what? This would be a really funny gift for Pamela's birthday. 

JERRY

Pamela? Do I know her? 

ELAINE

Yeah, you met her when we were going out. 

JERRY

Oh yeah, right... 

ELAINE

You have no idea who I'm talking about, do you? 

JERRY

(quickly) No. 

ELAINE

Blonde hair, remember? Glasses? (pause) Have you totally blocked out the entire time we were a couple? 

JERRY

(a lightbulb goes on in his head) Riverside Drive. 

ELAINE

Right! In fact... No, never mind... 

JERRY

Well, what is it? 

ELAINE

Well, a bunch of people are getting together tomorrow night at some bar for her birthday, but... (Jerry turns in disgust) you don't want to go to... that... no. 

JERRY

Wait a second, wait a second. We could work out a little deal here. 

ELAINE

What little deal? 

JERRY

I will go to that, if you go with me to a little family wedding I have on Saturday. 

ELAINE

A wedding? Have you lost it, man? 

JERRY

Y'know, my parents are coming in for this... 

ELAINE

They're coming in? 

JERRY

Yeah, tomorrow. 

ELAINE

Hey, did your father ever get that hair weave? 

JERRY

No, no. Still doin' the big sweep across. 

ELAINE

Why does he do that? 

JERRY

Doesn't think anyone can tell. So c'mon, do we have a deal? 

ELAINE

A wedding? 

JERRY

There's a lot of people to mock... 

ELAINE

All right, what the hell. 

JERRY

Great! 

WOMAN

When you're dead, you're dead. That's it. You're not goin' anywhere... 

ELAINE

C'mon lets go... 

JERRY

Was I supposed to bring something? 

ELAINE

You could have. 

JERRY

I met her one time... 

ELAINE

It is not necessary. 

JERRY

What did you say then? 

ELAINE

Sssshhhhhh!!! 

PAMELA

Hi 

ELAINE

Hi, Pamela, you remember Jerry. 

PAMELA

(shakes Jerry's hand) Yes, we met. 

JERRY

Hi, happy birthday. 

PAMELA

Thanks, ah, everybody, this is Elaine and Jerry. 

ELAINE

Hi 

JERRY

I didn't bring anything. 

PAMELA

Uh, I put you two right here. 

JERRY

Oh, Okay (turns to rest of table) I'm sorry, I didn't know what to bring, nobody told me. 

VANESSA

How big a tip do you think it'd take to get him to stop? 

JERRY

I'm in for five... 

VANESSA

I'll supply the hat. 

JERRY

(thinking) Uh-oh... What do we have here? 

VANESSA

Why don't you relax and take your jacket off? 

JERRY

Oh, I can't. Uh, I have a tendency to get chilly. 

VANESSA

How masculine. 

JERRY

Plus I'm wearing short sleeves, I don't want to expose my tattoos. (Vanessa smiles; thinking) She's unbelievable! 

ROGER

(to Vanessa) Hey, this guy says he knows Bricker. 

VANESSA

Oh, you know Bricker! From where? 

JERRY

(thinking) What's going on here? Gotta be her boyfriend, she's too good to be alone. What's the difference, I can't maneouver anyway with Elaine next to me. 

VANESSA

(to Jerry) How do you know Pamela? 

JERRY

Uh, friend of a friend. And you? 

VANESSA

We went to law school together. 

ELAINE

(interrupting Jerry's conversation) Oh, Jerry! 

JERRY

(turning to Elaine; thinking) Oh no, not now. 

ELAINE

I had this dream last night and you were in it. 

JERRY

Oh really? (tries turning away in the hopes Elaine gets the hint; thinking) Oh God, I gotta get out of this. 

ELAINE

You were you, but, you weren't you... 

JERRY

No kidding. (thinking) Why is this happening? Please, make her stop! 

ELAINE

I think, I think we were in my house where I grew up, and you were standing there, you were looking out the window... 

JERRY

(thinking) This is brutal. 

ELAINE

You turned around and you had these wooden teeth. 

JERRY

How do you like that? (tries to turn away again; thinking)Can I turn now? Is this over? No, I can't, I can't. I'm stuck. 

ELAINE

(noticing Jerry not wanting to listen; annoyed) Jerry? Are you listening to me? 

JERRY

Yes, I heard you. 

PAMELA

Elaine, what's the name of that jewelry store you took me to that time? 

JERRY

(thinking) Thank you, Pamela! (turns to talk to Vanessa; to Vanessa) So, you're a lawyer... 

VANESSA

Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft. 

JERRY

(thinking) Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft. Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft... (to Vanessa) Of course, they handled my tattoo removal lawsuit. 

VANESSA

Oh, that was you? 

JERRY

Imagine, spelling 'Mom' with two O's. 

VANESSA

Very funny! What do you do? 

JERRY

Comedian. 

VANESSA

Really? That explains it. 

JERRY

(thinking; quickly) Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft. Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft. 

ROGER

Are you ready? 

VANESSA

We gotta run. Happy birthday! 

JERRY

(thinking) I can't believe it. I got nothing! I don't even know her name! Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft. Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppen... Sagman... Sag... 

JERRY

That wasn't so bad, really. 

ELAINE

Y'know, um, you could use a little work on your manners. 

JERRY

Why? What did I do? 

ELAINE

Wel-Well, I just don't appreciate these little courtesy responses, like I'm selling you aluminum siding. 

JERRY

I was listening! 

ELAINE

No! You couldn't wait to get back to your little... 'conversation'. 

JERRY

No, you were talking about the, the um, the dream you had. 

ELAINE

Uh-huh... 

JERRY

Where you had, uh, wooden teeth. 

ELAINE

No! No! You had wooden teeth! You had wooden teeth! I didn't have wooden teeth, you did! 

JERRY

All right, so I had wooden teeth, so what? 

ELAINE

So nothing! Nothing. (annoyed sigh) 

JERRY

Apparently Plato, who came up with the concept of the platonic relationship, was pretty excited about it. He named it after himself. He said, 'Yeah, I got this new thing: Platonic. My idea, my name, callin' it after myself. What I do is, I go out with the girls, I talk with them- don't do anything, and go right home. What'd you think? I think it's going to be big!' I bet you there were other guys in history that tried to get relationships named after them, but it didn't work. Y'know, I bet you there were guys who tried to do it, just went, 'Uh, Hi, uh my name's Rico. Would you like to go to bed immediately? Hey, it's a Riconic relationship.' 

JERRY

Hey! 

MORTY

Ah, there he is! 

JERRY

This is what I like, see? You come home and your parents are in your bed! 

HELEN

Y'know, Jerry, we don't have to do this. 

JERRY

What are you talkin' about? It's fine, I love having you here. 

HELEN

Tomorrow we'll go to a hotel. 

JERRY

Ma, will you stop? 

HELEN

No, why should we take over your apartment? 

JERRY

I don't care. I'm sleeping next door. 

HELEN

Your friend Kramer doesn't mind? 

JERRY

No, he's making a bouillabaisse. 

JERRY

So, dad, lemme ask you a question. How many people work at these big law offices? 

MORTY

Depends on the firm. 

JERRY

Yeah, but if you called up and described someone, do you think they would know who it was? 

MORTY

What's the matter? You need a lawyer? 

JERRY

No, I met someone at this party, and I know where she works, but I don't know her name. 

MORTY

So why don't you ask someone who was at the party? 

JERRY

Nah, the only one I could ask is Elaine, and I can't ask her. 

HELEN

Why not? 

JERRY

Because it's complicated. There's some tension there. 

HELEN

He used to go with her. 

HELEN

Which one is she? 

MORTY

From Maryland. The one who brought you the chocolate covered cherries you didn't like. 

HELEN

Oh yeah, very alert. Warm person. 

JERRY

Oh yeah, she's great. 

HELEN

So, how come nothing materialized there? 

JERRY

Well, it's a tough thing to talk about uh. I dunno... 

HELEN

I know what it was. 

JERRY

You don't know what it was. 

HELEN

So, what was it? 

JERRY

Well, we fight a lot for some reason. 

MORTY

Oh, well... 

JERRY

And there was a little problem with the physical chemistry. 

HELEN

Well, I think she's a very attractive girl. 

JERRY

Oh, she is, she absolutely is. 

HELEN

I can see if there was a weight problem... 

JERRY

No, it's not that. It wasn't all one-sided. 

HELEN

You know, you can't be so particular. Nobody's perfect. 

JERRY

I know, I know... 

MORTY

Y'know Jerry, it's a good thing I wasn't so particular. 

HELEN

(hits Morty) Idiot. (to Jerry) So who're you looking for, Sophia Loren? 

JERRY

That's got nothin' to do with it. 

MORTY

How about Loni Anderson? 

HELEN

Where do you get Loni Anderson? 

MORTY

Why, what's wrong with Loni Anderson? 

HELEN

I like Elaine more than Loni Anderson. 

JERRY

What are you two talking about? Look, Elaine just wasn't the one. 

HELEN

And this other one's the one? 

JERRY

I dunno, maybe... 

MORTY

So ask Elaine there for her number. 

JERRY

I can't. She'll get upset. I never talk about other women with her, especially this one tonight. 

HELEN

How could you still see her if your not interested? 

JERRY

We're friends. 

MORTY

Doesn't sound like you're friends to me. If you were friends you'd-you'd ask her for the number. Do you know where this other one works? 

JERRY

Oh yeah. 

MORTY

Well, go up to the office. 

HELEN

Up to her office? 

MORTY

Go to the building. She goes out to lunch, doesn't she? 

JERRY

I guess. 

MORTY

So, you stand in the lobby, by the elevator, and wait for her to come down for lunch. 

JERRY

You mean stakeout the lobby? 

HELEN

Morty, that's ridiculous. Just ask Elaine for the number! 

MORTY

He doesn't want to ask Elaine for the number. 

HELEN

So you've got him standing by the elevator like a dope! What happens when he sees her? 

MORTY

He pretends he bumped into her! 

JERRY

Y'know what? This is not that bad an idea. 

GEORGE

What does she look like? 

JERRY

I dunno. Hard to say. 

GEORGE

What actress does she remind you of? 

JERRY

Loni Anderson. 

GEORGE

Loni Anderson?! 

JERRY

What, there's something wrong with Loni Anderson? (pause) Hey listen, thanks again for running over here. I appreciate it. 

GEORGE

Yeah, sure. I was showing a condo on 48th street. Besides, you think I wanna miss this? (chuckles) 

JERRY

I'm a little nervous. 

GEORGE

Yeah, me too... 

JERRY

If I see her, what do I say that I'm doing here in the building? 

GEORGE

You came to see me. I work in the building. 

JERRY

What do you do? 

GEORGE

I'm an architect. 

JERRY

You're an architect? 

GEORGE

I'm not? 

JERRY

I don't see architecture comin from you. 

GEORGE

(somewhat annoyed) I suppose you could be an architect. 

JERRY

I never said that I was the architect. Just somethin' else. 

GEORGE

All right, she's not even gonna ask, if we see her, which is remote. 

JERRY

Well whaddaya want me to say, that I just wandered in here? 

GEORGE

We're having lunch with a friend. He works in the building. 

JERRY

What is his name? 

GEORGE

Bert... Har... bin... son. Bert Har-bin-son. 

JERRY

Bert Harbinson? It sounds made up. 

GEORGE

No good? All right, uh how about Art... Cor..... 

JERRY

Art Cor... 

GEORGE

...velay. 

JERRY

Corvelay? 

GEORGE

Yeah, right. 

JERRY

Well, what does he do? 

GEORGE

He's an importer. 

JERRY

Just imports, no exports? 

GEORGE

(annoyed) He's an importer/exporter, okay? (beat) Elaine ever call you back? 

JERRY

No, I guess she's still mad. 

GEORGE

I don't understand, you never talk to her about other women? 

JERRY

Never. (The elevator door opens.) Wait a second. That's her. On the right. 

GEORGE

(anxious) I forgot who I am! Who am I?! 

JERRY

You're you. We're having lunch with Art Corvelay. 

GEORGE

Vandelay! 

JERRY

Corvelay! 

GEORGE

Let me be the architect! I can do it! 

JERRY

Hey, hey. uh Pamela's birthday party, didn't I see you there? Jerry. 

VANESSA

Sure! Hi! 

JERRY

Uh, this is George. (reaches for her name) I'm sorry... 

VANESSA

Vanessa. 

GEORGE

Nice to meet you. 

JERRY

Ah, Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft. 

VANESSA

That's right! Yea, what're you doing here? 

JERRY

Oh, we're meeting a friend of ours for lunch. He works here in the building. 

GEORGE

Yeah, Art Vandelay. 

VANESSA

Really? Which company? 

VANESSA

Importer? 

GEORGE

...And exporter. 

JERRY

He's an importer/exporter. 

GEORGE

(clears his throat) I'm, uh, I'm an architect. 

VANESSA

Really. What do you design? 

GEORGE

Uh, railroads, uh... 

VANESSA

I thought engineers do that. 

GEORGE

They can... 

JERRY

Y'know I'm sorry you had to leave so early the other night. 

VANESSA

Oh, me too. My cousin had to go back to Boston. 

JERRY

Oh, that guy was your cousin! (walking in front of George so he gets the picture to leave) 

VANESSA

Yeah, and that woman was your... 

JERRY

Friend! 

GEORGE

I'll just, uh, get a paper... 

JERRY

So, um, do you date uh immature men? 

VANESSA

Almost exclusively... 

HELEN

Bum bum bum bum... I have no letters... Bum bum bum bum... 

JERRY

(annoyed) Ma, will you go already? 

HELEN

Bum bum bum bum... 

JERRY

What are you doing?! 

HELEN

Wait, I just want to see something. 

JERRY

You can't look in there, we're playing! 

KRAMER

Hi. 

JERRY

Hi. 

MORTY

(cleaning his shoes) Good evening, Mr. Kramer! 

KRAMER

Hey Morty! (to Jerry) Salad dressing? 

JERRY

Look. 

HELEN

'Quo'. Is that a word? 

JERRY

Maybe! 

HELEN

Will you challenge it? 

JERRY

Ma, you can't look up words in the dictionary! (to Morty) Dad, she's cheating! 

KRAMER

'Quo'? That's not a word. 

HELEN

(to Jerry) You're such a stickler... 

JERRY

Well put something down, you're taking twenty minutes on this. So is Uncle Mac and Artie, they're all coming over here before the wedding? 

HELEN

They'll be here at two o'clock. Oh, Elaine called. She said she'd be here at two-thirty. And she says 'Hope your meeting went well with 'Art Vandelay'?' 

JERRY

She said what? 

HELEN

Just what I said, here. 

JERRY

She knows! Oh, I am such a jackass. 

HELEN

She knows what? 

JERRY

She knows the whole stupid thing. Vanessa and the elevator... 

HELEN

No, no, no, that won't do. He may have a 'Z'. 

MORTY

So, how did she find out? 

JERRY

Because, Vanessa probably told Pamela, and Pamela probably told Elaine. 

MORTY

So, what are you? Afraid of her? 

JERRY

Yes. Yes I am! (to Helen) What else did she say on the phone? 

HELEN

Whatever I wrote down. 

JERRY

Yeah, but what was the tone in her voice? How did she sound? 

HELEN

Who am I, Rich Little? 

MORTY

Well, she can't be too mad. She's still coming to the wedding. 

JERRY

Yeah, but now I'm nervous. 

HELEN

Oh, stop it. 

JERRY

'Quone'? 

HELEN

...30...31... 

JERRY

'Quone'? No, I'm afraid that I'm going to have to challenge that. 

HELEN

...32... 

KRAMER

No, you don't have to challenge that. That's a word. That's a definite word. 

JERRY

I am challenging. 

KRAMER

Quone. To quone something. 

JERRY

Uh-huh. 

HELEN

I'm not playing with you anymore. 

MORTY

Quone's not a word. 

JERRY

No good. Sorry. There it is. Get it off. 

HELEN

(to Kramer) Why did you make me put that down? 

KRAMER

Nah, we need a medical dictionary! If a patient gets difficult, you quone him. 

CAROL

You want some funny material, you oughta come down to where I work, now that's a sitcom! 

JERRY

You must have quite a time down there. 

CAROL

We got plenty of time. 

JERRY

Oh, I'm sorry. I'm just waiting for someone. 

MAC

Watch what you say to this guy. He'll put it in his next act! 

JERRY

Yeah, yeah... 

MAC

Jerry, did I tell you that I'm writing a book? An autobiography. 

JERRY

Yeah, Uncle Mac, you mentioned it. 

MAC

It's based on all my experiences! 

JERRY

That's perfect. 

JERRY

Could you excuse me one second? I'm sorry. 

JERRY

How do you do? (introducing himself) Uh, Jerry Seinfeld. 

ELAINE

Oh, how do you do? Elaine Benes. 

JERRY

Um, do you want to do this now, or do you want to wait until we get in the car? 

ELAINE

Oh no, let's do it now. 

JERRY

All right, the whole elevator business, let me just explain- 

ELAINE

Okay. 

ARTIE

Jerry, were you goin' with us? 

JERRY

No, I'm gonna take my car. 

ARTIE

That's why I brought the wagon. Why the hell did I bring the wagon? 

JERRY

Anyway, you know why I didn't ask you, I mean I felt so uncomfortable, and you were so annoyed in the cab. 

ELAINE

Well, Jerry, I never saw you flirt with anyone before. It was quite the spectacle. 

CAROL

Jerry, we'll see you there. Bye, Elaine. 

ELAINE

Oh, bye. Good to see you. 

ARTIE

Oh, we didn't meet. 

JERRY

Oh, I'm sorry. Elaine, this is my cousin, Artie Levine. 

ARTIE

(correcting Jerry) Levine. 

JERRY

(sarcastically) Yeah, 'Levine'. And I'm Jerry Cougar Mellencamp. Anyway, I admit it was a fairly ridiculous thing to do, but I mean, I mean, obviously we have a little problem here. 

ELAINE

Yeah, obviously. 

JERRY

I mean, if we're gonna be friends, we gotta be able to talk about other people. 

ELAINE

Couldn't agree more. 

JERRY

Good. 

ELAINE

Good. 

JERRY

Good. 

ELAINE

Great! 

JERRY

Great? Where do you get 'great'? 

ELAINE

It's great to... talk about... other people... 

JERRY

...Guys? 

ELAINE

Yeah. 

JERRY

Uh-huh. Yeah. So, anybody specific? 

ELAINE

No. A general guy. 

JERRY

Oh really? Elaine Marie Benes... 

ELAINE

What? No, it's not a big deal. 

JERRY

No, that's great! That's terrific! 

ELAINE

No, we just met... 

JERRY

Doesn't matter. What's the young man's name? I would like to meet him. 

ELAINE

Hmmm, I don't think so. 

JERRY

Well, what does he do? Is he an artisan, a craftsman, a labourer of some sort? 

ELAINE

Wall street. 

JERRY

Ah, high finance. Bulls, Bears, people from Conneticut. 

ELAINE

And he happens to be pretty good lookin'. 

JERRY

(pause) All right, sir. 

ELAINE

And... he's hilarious. 

JERRY

Now that's not fair! So where did you meet this guy? 

ELAINE

I staked out his health club. 

JERRY

Uh huh. When you're on a stakeout, do you find it's better to stand up against the wall, or kinda crouch down behind a big plant? 

JERRY

Y'know I think that even if you've had a relationship with someone, or let's say, especially if you've had a relationship with someone and you try to become friends afterwards, it's very difficult. Isn't this? It's hard. Because, you know each other so well, you know all of each others tricks. It's like two magicians, trying to entertain each other. The one goes, 'Look, a rabbit.' The other goes, 'So? I believe this is your card.' 'Look, why don't we just saw each other in half and call it a night, okay?' 

JERRY

Is that it? Got the cue tips, got the mini-umbrella, something boring to read on the plane. (Jerry zips his bag ceremoniously.) That's it. Done! 

ELAINE

(claps her hands) That is the single greatest packing performance I have ever seen. 

JERRY

(proudly) I am...the master packer. 

ELAINE

(laughs) Yeah, right, you're the master packer. 

JERRY

What you must understand, Elaine, (picking up the umbrella) packing is no different than leading men into battle. (Jerry hits his bag rhythmically with his umbrella.) You've gotta know the strengths and weaknesses of every soldier in that platoon. From a collapsible toothbrush to a pair of ordinary black socks. 

ELAINE

(raising her hand) 'Scuse me, master packer... 

JERRY

Yes. 

ELAINE

Just gimme your keys. 

JERRY

All right, sir. (He tosses Elaine his keys. The apartment buzzer goes off; Jerry presses the first button; to the intercom) George? 

GEORGE

(from the intercom) Yeah. 

ELAINE

Okay, so, now, is there anything else I need to know about this place? 

JERRY

Uh, yeah, the, uh, hot water takes a little while to come on. So, the best thing to do is to turn it on, do all your shopping, you come back and take a shower. 

ELAINE

Okay, this is quite a place. 

JERRY

There's more. The refrigerator. 

JERRY

Deduct a minimum of two days off all expiration dates. (He uses the umbrella to point to certain compartments in the fridge.) No meat, no leftovers, no butter. (He closes the fridge.) And I cannot overstate this: No soft cheeses of any kind. Is that clear? 

ELAINE

I'll eat out. 

JERRY

One more thing, Benes, regarding sexual activity: Strictly prohibited, but if you absolutely must, do us all a big favour. Do it in the tub. 

GEORGE

(to Jerry) Ready? 

JERRY

Yeah, one sec. 

GEORGE

Hey, Elaine. 

ELAINE

Hi. 

GEORGE

Coming to the airport with us? 

ELAINE

No, I'm staying here for the weekend. I'm getting a break from my roommate. 

GEORGE

Oh, the actress-waitress? 

ELAINE

No, the waitress-actress. She just got some part in some dinner theater production of 'A Chorus Line'. So, now all day long she's walking around the apartment singing, 'God, I hope I get it, I hope I get it!' She's gonna get it right in her... 

GEORGE

So just kick her out. 

ELAINE

She's on the lease! George you have got to find another place for me. 

GEORGE

Yeah, well...a little rough finding something good in your price-range. (to Jerry) But you, my friend, may be in luck. 

JERRY

I'm not looking. 

GEORGE

No no no, this one's different. This one's a beauty! 

JERRY

Yeah, what's it like? 

GEORGE

I haven't seen it yet, but it's a two-bedroom, it's on the uh, west 83rd, 'bout a half block from the park? 

JERRY

How much? 

GEORGE

Uh, twice what you're payin' here, but it's a great building. It's two bedrooms! 

JERRY

Two bedrooms? Why do I need two bedrooms? I got enough trouble maintaining activity in one. (George gives Elaine a look while Jerry's back is turned. Jerry turns around.) I saw that. 

ELAINE

You oughta at least take a look at it. 

JERRY

Really? Why? 

ELAINE

'Cause then I could move in here. 

JERRY

Ohhhh... 

ELAINE

It's time you got outta here anyway. 

GEORGE

Yeah, tell 'im. But quickly, I'm double parked here. 

ELAINE

Listen, Jerry, this place is falling apart. You have no hot water, you can't have soft cheese... 

GEORGE

Let's not forget the radiator. The steam has been on here for ten years. No human can turn this off. 

ELAINE

Jerry, come on, you're doin' okay now. You should at least take a look at this place. You shouldn't have to live like this. 

JERRY

Like this? You just said you wanted to live here. 

ELAINE

Well, for me it's a step up. It's like moving from Iceland to Finland. 

GEORGE

Jerry, what do you, you wanna, you wanna see the place or not? 

JERRY

I can't think about it now. Come on, I'm going to Minneapolis. I got four shows this weekend. 

JERRY

Elaine. (Jerry puts his bags down, sits down on the couch, picks up the remote control and points it at the spot the TV usually occupies. The TV is not there. He continues to point the remote at random things around the room, searching for the TV.) ELAINE! 

ELAINE

(from the bathroom) JERRY! (Elaine enters the living-room.) Jerry, oh, hi, welcome back. How were the shows? 

JERRY

Great, I had fun. Where's the TV, where's the VCR? 

JERRY

What? 

ELAINE

They were stolen. 

JERRY

Stolen? When? 

ELAINE

A couple a hours ago. The police are coming right over. 

JERRY

Stolen? 

ELAINE

(looking at Kramer) Someone left the door open. 

JERRY

(to Kramer) You left the door open?! 

KRAMER

Uh, Jer, well you know, I was cookin' and I, I uh, I came in to get this spatula...and I left the door open, 'cause I was gonna bring the spatula right back! 

JERRY

Wait, you left the lock open or the door open? 

KRAMER

(guiltily) The door. 

JERRY

The door? You left the door open? 

KRAMER

Yeah, well, I was gonna bring the spatula right back. 

JERRY

Yeah, and? 

KRAMER

Well, I got caught up... watching a soap opera. 'The Bold And The Beautiful'. 

JERRY

So the door was wide open? 

KRAMER

Wide open! 

JERRY

(to Elaine) And where were you? 

ELAINE

I was at Bloomingdale's... waiting for the shower to heat up. 

KRAMER

Look, Jerry, I'm sorry, I'm uh- you have insurance, right buddy? 

JERRY

No. 

KRAMER

(shocked) How can you not have insurance? 

JERRY

Because I spent my money on the Clapgo D-29. It's the most impenetrable lock on the market today. It has only one design flaw. The door... (Jerry pushes the door shut.) ...MUST BE CLOSED!! 

KRAMER

Jerry! I'm gonna find your stuff. I'm gonna solve it, I'm on the case, buddy, I'm on the case. 

JERRY

Yeah, don't investigate, don't pay me back, it was an accident. 

KRAMER

(theatrical) I made a mistake. 

ELAINE

These things happen. 

KRAMER

I'm human. 

JERRY

In your way. 

POLICEMAN

Let's see, that's, one TV, a stereo, one leather jacket, a VCR and a computer...is that 'bout it? 

ELAINE

Answering machine. 

JERRY

(disappointed) Answering machine. (jovially) Oh, I hate the idea of somebody out there returning my calls. 

POLICEMAN

What do you mean? 

JERRY

It's a joke. 

POLICEMAN

I see. Well, mister Seinfeld uh, we'll look into it and uh, we'll let you know if we uh, you know, if we find anything. 

JERRY

You ever find anything? 

POLICEMAN

No. 

JERRY

Well, thanks anyway. 

POLICEMAN

You bet. 

ELAINE

I didn't get that joke either. 

JERRY

The crook has the machine. The messages aren't for him. He's the crook. Why would he answer- (Jerry gives up on the explanation and turns around to see George standing behind him.) How did you get in here? 

JERRY

Again? 

GEORGE

I don't know how you put up with this. 

ELAINE

Yeah, tell 'im George. 

JERRY

(to Elaine) You would still wanna move in here? 

ELAINE

Yes! You don't understand. I'm living with Ethel Merman without the talent. 

JERRY

(to George) Is that uh, other apartment still available? 

JERRY

I got ripped off for about the...18th time? And now, the first couple a times you go through it, it's very upsetting and your first reaction or one of your friends will say, 'Call the police. You really should call the police.' So you think to yourself, you know, you watch TV, you think, 'Yeah, I'm calling the police. Stakeouts, manhunts... I'm gonna see some real action.' Right, you think that. So, the police come over to your house, they fill out: The Report. They give you: Your Copy. Now, unless they give the crook his copy, I don't really think we're gonna crack this case, do you? It's not like Batman, where there's three crooks in the city and everybody pretty much knows, who they are. Very few crooks even go to the trouble to come up with a theme for their careers anymore. It makes them a lot tougher to spot. 'Did you lose a sony? It could be the Penguin. I think we can round him up, he's dressed like a PENGUIN! We can find him, he's a PENGUIN! 

ELAINE

Oh, well, come on. This is an apartment, this is a home! This is a place to live. Oooh, a fireplace, are you kidding me! Does this work? 

GEORGE

I didn't know there was a fireplace. A fireplace, that's incredible. 

JERRY

How do you get all that wood in here? 

ELAINE

They deliver it. 

JERRY

They deliver wood? 

ELAINE

Yeah. 

JERRY

What do you tip a wood guy? 

GEORGE

I didn't know there was a fireplace. 

ELAINE

Look! Look at- look at this! There's a garden. 

GEORGE

A garden! I can't believe there's a garden! 

JERRY

Would I have to get a gardener? 

ELAINE

Yeah, you can get a gardener. 

JERRY

You tip him? 

ELAINE

You can. 

GEORGE

(to Elaine) You don't tip a gardener! 

ELAINE

You can tip a gardener. 

GEORGE

You don't need a gardener. 

ELAINE

Jerry, you can barbecue back here. 

JERRY

They deliver the coal? 

ELAINE

Sure, it's...probably the same guy, who delivers the wood. 

JERRY

Oh, then I gotta tip him. 

ELAINE

Oh, damn, this place is incredible, look at all this great light! 

JERRY

I don't have any plants. 

GEORGE

I have plants. (snorts) 

ELAINE

Jerry, look at this closet! Look at this! I'm walking in it! (Elaine walks into the closet.) It's a walk-in. Can you believe it? I'm nuts about this, what do you think? 

JERRY

I like that. (He opens the closet. Elaine walks out with an angry look.) What do you think, George? 

GEORGE

It's your decision. 

JERRY

I'm takin' it, I'm takin' the place. I'm gonna take it, this is gonna be my new place. I'm livin' here...I'm movin'. 

ELAINE

(laughing with joy) Your movin'? That means I'm movin'. (She hugs Jerry.) Geeeeee (to George) isn't that incredible! 

GEORGE

(unenthusiastic) Congratulations. 

ELAINE

What about the couch? 

JERRY

You like the couch? I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. 

ELAINE

What? 

JERRY

You're movin' in, you're a good friend, I wanna start you off on the right foot. Give me...a hundred and fifty dollars. (Elaine is shocked, Jerry opens the door to the hall.) Get it outta here right now, take it out the door, I don't even wanna see it, go, get it out. 

ELAINE

A hundred and fifty dollars? A hundred and fifty dollars for what? For this couch? 

JERRY

Yeah! 

ELAINE

For this couch?! 

JERRY

Okay, you tell me. What is it worth? 

ELAINE

Okay, uh, I'll tell you what. I could go as high as uh... (She takes a closer look at couch.) I don't know, maybe...twenty dollars? 

JERRY

Yeah? 

GEORGE

(from the intercom) Yeah, it's George. 

JERRY

Come on up. (Jerry presses the second button and opens the apartment door. He walks back to the couch.) Oh, all right, forget it, I'm gonna take it with me now... (He picks up the cushions.) I'm just gonna pack up the cushions right now... 

ELAINE

Okay okay okay okay, you win. Forty dollars. 

JERRY

(continuing unphased) You wanna get the other end, 'cause I wanna get it in the hall. 

ELAINE

Fifty dollars, okay? Fifty dollars, is that all right? 

JERRY

Fifty dollars? 

ELAINE

Uh-huh. 

JERRY

Thank you very much. 

ELAINE

Thank you very much. 

GEORGE

Hey, what's goin' on? 

ELAINE

I just bought Jerry's couch for fifty dollars. 

JERRY

(to George) So did you bring the lease? (George takes the lease from his inside pocket and hands it to Jerry.) All right, gee, three years, that kinda seems like a long time. 

GEORGE

(frantic) Oh, Jerry Jerry Jerry Jerry Jerry, listen, if, if you are feeling uncomfortable about this at all, at all. Do not feel like you have to take it. 

JERRY

Why? 

GEORGE

If you're having second thoughts, if you didn't want it, don't worry about it because uh, you know, I, I...I could take it, you know. 

JERRY

You could take it? You want it? 

GEORGE

No, I don't want it. I want it, if you don't want it. 

JERRY

So you do want it. 

GEORGE

No I, I want it if you don't want it. 

JERRY

You just said you wanted it! 

GEORGE

No, I'm saying, if a situation arose in which you didn't want it, I might take it. 

JERRY

So take it. 

GEORGE

How can I take it? 

JERRY

How can I take it? 

GEORGE

It's your apartment! 

JERRY

How can I want it now, if you want it? 

ELAINE

Excuse me, uh, I don't mean to cause any trouble here, but George, if you take it, can I take your place? 

GEORGE

Yes, but I am not taking it. 

JERRY

I...am not taking it. 

ELAINE

Well, one of you better damn well take it! 

JERRY

Well, whaddaya wanna do here? 

GEORGE

I, I don't know. 

JERRY

Do you wanna flip a coin? 

GEORGE

Who flips? You'll flip, I'll call. 

JERRY

Okay, fine. (Jerry takes a coin from his pocket.) This is the official flip. No crying, no guilt, winner takes all and that's it. Agreed? 

GEORGE

I'm good. 

ELAINE

I don't know, who to root for, George's place has carpeting. 

JERRY

All right, now you call it in the air. 

GEORGE

No catchin'. 

JERRY

No no. 

GEORGE

Flip it. 

GEORGE

Heads! 

JERRY

Tails! 

GEORGE

No, it hit the table, it hit the table. 

JERRY

So what? 

GEORGE

Interference! You can't count that! Come on, are you crazy?! The coin cannot touch anything, it affects it. 

JERRY

You didn't call no interference! 

GEORGE

You don't have to call that! That's a rule! 

JERRY

I don't believe this. 

GEORGE

Oh oh oh, all right, fine, Jerry, you win. Take it, just take it! 

JERRY

I don't wanna win it like this! Elaine, what do you think? 

ELAINE

I'd better not. 

JERRY

Well, I'll tell you what. I'll choose you for it. Straight choose, three takes it, no disputes...that's it, you gotta win three. 

GEORGE

Okay. (They walk around each other.) OK. I'll choose you. Whaddaya want? 

JERRY

Odds. 

GEORGE

I want evens. 

JERRY

Good. 

GEORGE

You got odds. 

JERRY

You got evens. 

GEORGE

Right, ready? 

JERRY

For the apartment. 

BOTH

Once, twice, three, shoot! 

JERRY

Mine! 

BOTH

Once, twice, three, shoot! 

JERRY

Mine! 

BOTH

Once, twice, three, shoot! 

GEORGE

Mine! 

BOTH

Once, twice, three, shoot! 

GEORGE

Congratulations...congratulations. 

JERRY

Thanks. 

GEORGE

I'm just gonna...wash. (George walks to the bathroom; screaming) WHY DID I PUT UP TWO? WHY DID I PUT UP TWO? 

KRAMER

Jerry, I think I'm on to something. I think I found your stuff. You know the Englishman who lives down the hall? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

KRAMER

The last couple a days he's been acting very strange. I think he's avoiding me. 

JERRY

Hard to imagine. 

KRAMER

Yeah! And get this: I just got off the elevator with him and I tested him, I tested him, like I...this is what I said to him, like I, I was like this, I went, 'Oh, by the way, I know about the stuff.' 

KRAMER

..you know, very casually, 

JERRY

Right. 

KRAMER

(cont'd) so that he was gonna take me into his confidence. 

ELAINE

So what did he say? 

KRAMER

'What stuff?' 

JERRY

Ooh, (to Elaine) case closed! 

KRAMER

No, you don't understand, you see, he swallowed. See, the guy, he swallowed. Oh, he was nervous about something! Now, I'm gonna go over there, I'm gonna borrow some tea. If I don't get back in five minutes, maybe you'd better call the police. 

JERRY

Okay, starting...NOW! 

KRAMER

Yeah! 

JERRY

One of the problems in life is that when you're a kid, you have a certain way of working out disagreements. And those laws do not work in the adult world. One of the main ways that kids resolve any dispute is by calling it. One of them says, 'I got the front seat' 'I wanted the front seat!' 'I called it'. And the other kid knows he's got nothing to say: 'He called it. What can I do?' If there was a Kid Court Of Law, it holds up. 'Your Honour, my client did ask for the front seat' And the judge would go, 'Did he call it?' 'Well no, he didn't call-' BANG! (Jerry imitates a judge banging his gavel.) 'He has to call it, case closed. Objection overruled.' 

GEORGE

I love the mirror in that bathroom! I don't know what in the hell it is. I look terrific in that mirror. (George sits.) I don't know if it's the tile or the lighting... I feel like Robert Wagner. 

JERRY

It's a good mirror. (They look at their menus.) So, what are you gettin'? 

GEORGE

I don't know, I can't eat. You, you can't have anything anymore. Look at this, look at this. Eggs: out. Coffee: out. French fries: out. BLT: out! I go to visit my grandparents: three big brisket sandwiches, I'm sittin' here with a carrot! They're closing in on a hundred, I'm sayin' to them, 'How can you eat that stuff?' (They look at their menus again.) I'm so sick about losin' that choose, you don't know. 

JERRY

All right, forget it, forget it. I'm not taking the place! 

GEORGE

What?! 

JERRY

How can I live there? 

GEORGE

Why not?! 

JERRY

Look at you, you're still thinking about it. I'll never feel comfortable. 

GEORGE

Oh, get outta here. 

JERRY

How can I ever have you over? You'll sit there moping. 

GEORGE

I won't mope. 

JERRY

You're already moping! Would you take the place? 

GEORGE

No, impossible! It's your apartment. 

JERRY

You found the place. 

GEORGE

You won the choose. 

JERRY

All right, forget it, it's over, I'm not moving. 

GEORGE

Well, me neither. 

JERRY

Definitely? 

GEORGE

Definitely. 

JERRY

Alright, then just get rid of it. You won't have any problem. 

GEORGE

No, it's not a problem, I can get rid of the apartment this afternoon. 

CAROL

What apartment? 

GEORGE

Oh, it's a great place, it's uh two-bedroom uh, west 83rd 'bout half block from the park. 

CAROL

What's the rent? 

GEORGE

I don't know, what we're doin' here, this is ridiculous. 

JERRY

She wanted to thank us for the apartment. 

ELAINE

I can't believe I lost the deposit on that U-Haul. And I threw out my couch. 

JERRY

If only the coin hadn't hit the table. 

GEORGE

The table is interference, you know it! 

JERRY

It is not! 

GEORGE

It is too! 

ELAINE

My roommate starts rehearsal tonight on 'Carousel'. 

CAROL

Hi. 

GEORGE

Hi, Carol. 

CAROL

I just wanted to introduce you to my husband, this is Larry. 

CAROL

This is George, Elaine and Jerry. These are the guys who got us the apartment. 

LARRY

Oh, you don't know how grateful I am, if there's anything I can ever do to repay you, I, I mean, we're just so thrilled with this place. 

CAROL

It's a dream. 

LARRY

I'm running in the park now, I've lost weight, we're barbecuing every night and the rent is unbelievable. 

GEORGE

We're really glad for you. 

ELAINE

Couldn't be happier. 

JERRY

It's wonderful. 

CAROL

Diane, Diane, come here. 

CAROL

This is my new next door neighbour, Diane. 

CAROL

(to Diane) These are the guys, who turned this place down, can you believe it? (to Jerry, George and Elaine) Diane gave me the greatest backrub today. She's a masseuse! 

DIANE

How, how could you guys have turned this place down, it's such a great location and it's...so close to the park. 

GEORGE

We're aware of the proximity to the park, yes. 

DIANE

Well, it was nice to meet you. 

GEORGE

Nice meeting you. 

JERRY

How late are the stores open? I'm thinking of maybe uh, buying a new TV and smash it over my head. 

ELAINE

What's the rent? 

GEORGE

I had to say something. (chuckles) I had to say something. Everything was going so well. I had to say something. 

JERRY

I don't think you did anything wrong. 

GEORGE

I told her I liked her. Why? Why did I tell her I like her? I have this sick compulsion to tell women how I feel. I like you I don't tell you. 

JERRY

We can only thank God for that. 

GEORGE

I'm outta the picture. I am outta the picture. (laughs) It's only a matter of time now. 

JERRY

You're imagining this. Really. 

GEORGE

Oh, no. No no no no. 

GEORGE

I'll tell you when it happened. When that floss came flying out of my pocket. 

JERRY

What floss? When? 

GEORGE

We were in the lobby during the intermission of the play. I was buying her one of those containers of orange drink, for five dollars. I reached into my pocket to pay for it, I looked down; there's this piece of green floss hanging from my fingers. 

JERRY

Ah, mint. 

GEORGE

Of course. So, I'm looking at it. I look up, I see she's looking at it. Our eyes lock. It was a horrible moment. I just.. 

JERRY

So let me get this straight. She saw the floss, you panicked and you told her you liked her. 

GEORGE

If I didn't put that floss in my pocket, I'd be crawling around her bedroom right now looking for my glasses. 

JERRY

And you're sure the floss was the catalyst? 

GEORGE

Yes, I am. 

JERRY

You don't think it might've had anything to do with that? 

GEORGE

What? You don't like this? 

JERRY

It looks like your belt is digesting a small animal. 

KRAMER

(to the phone) Oh, they've got a cure for cancer. See, it's all big business. Oh hey, Jerry just walked in. Hi, George. (to the phone again) Yeah yeah yeah yeah take my number. 555-8643. Okay, here he is. 

JERRY

(to Kramer) Who is it? 

KRAMER

Take it. 

JERRY

Who is it? 

KRAMER

It's for you. 

JERRY

(to the phone) Hello? (disappointed) Oh, hi Joel. (Jerry hits Kramer with a magazine.) No. Uh, I was out of town. I just got back. Kramer doesn't know anything. He's just my next-door neighbor. Uh, nothing much... Tuesday? Uh, Tuesday, no. I'm meeting somebody... Uh, Wednesday? Wednesday's okay... All right. Uh, I'm a little busy right now. Can we talk Wednesday morning?... Okay... Yeah... Right... Thanks... Bye. (Jerry hangs up; to Kramer) Why did you put me on the phone with him? I hate just being handed a phone. 

KRAMER

Well, it's your phone. He wanted to talk to you. 

JERRY

Maybe I didn't want to talk to him. 

KRAMER

Well, why not? 

JERRY

He bothers me. I don't even answer the phone anymore because of him. He's turned me into a screener. Now I gotta go see him on Wednesday. 

GEORGE

What do you mean Wednesday? I though we had tickets to the Knick game Wednesday. We got seats behind the bench! What happened? We're not going? 

JERRY

We're going. That's next Wednesday. 

GEORGE

Oh. Who is this guy? 

JERRY

His name is Joel Horneck. He lived like three houses down from me when I grew up. He had a Ping Pong table. We were friends. Should I suffer the rest of my life because I like to play Ping Pong? I was ten. I would've been friends with Stalin if he had a Ping Pong table. He's so self-involved. 

KRAMER

That's for me. (to the phone) Kramerica Industries. Oh, hi, Mark. No no no. Forget that. I got a better idea. A pizza place where you make your own pie... 

JERRY

Can you conduct your business elsewhere? 

KRAMER

(ignoring Jerry) No no no. I'm talking about a whole chain of 'em. Yeah. 

GEORGE

I don't know why you even bother with this ping pong guy, I'll tell you that. 

JERRY

I don't bother with him. He's been calling me for seven years. I've never called him once! He's got the attention span of a five-year-old. Sometimes I sit there and I make up things just to see if he's paying attention. 

GEORGE

I don't understand why you spend time with this guy. 

JERRY

What can I do? Break up with him? Tell him, 'I don't think we're right for each other.' He's a guy! At least with a woman, there's a precendent. You know, the relationship goes sour, you end it. 

GEORGE

No no no no, you have to approach this as if he was a woman. 

JERRY

Just break up with him? 

GEORGE

Absolutely. You just tell him the truth. 

JERRY

The Truth. 

JERRY

As a guy I don't know how I can break up with another guy. You know what I mean? I don't know how to say, 'Bill, I feel I need to see other men.' Do you know what I mean? There's nothing I can do. I have to wait for someone to die. I think that's the only way out of this relationship. It could be a long time. See, the great thing about guys is that we can become friends based on almost nothing. Just two guys will just become friends just because they're two guys. That's almost all we need to have in common. 'Cause sports ' sports and women ' is really all we talk about. If there was no sports and no women the only thing guys would ever say is, 'So, what's in the refrigerator?' 

JOEL

...so my shrink wants me to bring my mother in for a session. This guy is a brilliant man. Lenny Bruce used to go to him. And I think, uh, Geraldo. 

JERRY

You know, I read the Lenny Bruce biography, I thought it was really... interesting. He would- 

JOEL

(to the counter of the restaurant) Hey hey hey hey, we're starving here! We've been waiting here for ten minutes already! 

JERRY

(testing Joel) So, I'm thinking about going to Iran this summer. 

JOEL

I have to eat! I mean, I'm hypoglycemic. 

JERRY

Anyway, the Hizballah has invited me to perform. (Joel shakes his head agreeing; Jerry smiles) You know, it's their annual terrorist luncheon. 

JOEL

Yeah. 

JERRY

(cont'd) I'm gonna do it in Farsi. 

JOEL

Do you think I need a haircut? 

CLAIRE

Are you ready? 

JERRY

Yeah, I'll have the egg salad on whole wheat. 

JOEL

(to the waitress) Let me ask you a question. This, uh, this turkey sandwich here, is that real turkey, or is it a turkey roll? I don't want that processed turkey. (to Jerry) I hate it. 

WAITRESS

I think it's real turkey. 

JOEL

Is there a real bird in the back? 

WAITRESS

No, there's not bird but- 

JOEL

Well, how do you know for sure? Look, why don't you do me a favor. Why don't you go in the back and find out, okay? (The waitress leaves.) Unbelievable. 

JERRY

How can you talk to someone like that? 

JOEL

What are you saying? What, you like turkey roll? 

JERRY

Listen, Joel. There's something I have to tell you... 

JOEL

(laughing) Wait, you'll never guess who I ran into. 

JOEL

Howard Metro. 

JOEL

He asked me if I still saw you. I said, 'Sure, I see him all the time. We're still great friends.' Anyway, Howard says hello. (laughs) 

JERRY

Listen, Joel, I don't think we should see each other anymore. 

JOEL

What? 

JERRY

This friendship: It's not working. 

JOEL

Not working? What are you talking about? 

JERRY

We're just not suited to be friends. 

JOEL

How can you say that? 

JERRY

Look, you're a nice guy, it's just that... we don't have anything in common. 

JOEL

(starting to cry) Wai-Wait. What did I do? Tell me. I want to know what I did. 

JERRY

Y-You didn't do anything. It's not you, it's me. It's- this is very difficult. 

JOEL

Look, I know I call you too much, right? I mean, I know you're a very busy guy. 

JERRY

No, it's not that. 

JOEL

(crying) You're one of the few people I can talk to. 

JERRY

Oh, come on. That's not true. 

JOEL

I always tell everybody about you. Tell everybody to (to the rest of the coffee shop) GO SEE HIS SHOW! (to Jerry) I mean, I'm your biggest fan! 

JERRY

I know, I know. 

JOEL

I mean, you're my best friend. 

JERRY

Best friend- I've never been to your apartment. 

JOEL

I cannot believe that this is happening. I can't believe it. 

JERRY

Okay, okay. Forget it. It's okay. I didn't mean it. 

JOEL

Didn't mean what? 

JERRY

What I said. I've been under a lot of stress. 

JOEL

Oh, you've been under a lot of stress. 

JERRY

Just, can we just forget the whole thing ever happend? I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. I took it out on you. We're still friends. We're still friends. Still friends. Okay? Look, I'll tell you what. I've got Knick tickets this Wednesday. Great seats behind the bench. You want to come with me? Come on. 

JOEL

Tonight? 

JERRY

No, next Wednesday. If it was tonight, I would've said tonight. 

JOEL

Do you really want me to go? 

JERRY

(lying) Yes. 

JOEL

Okay. (Jerry gives him some napkins to clean himself up) Yeah, okay. Great! That would be, that'd be great. So, next Wednesday. 

JERRY

Next Wednesday. 

JOEL

Where is that waitress? (to the counter) Hey! 

GEORGE

...she calls me up at my office 

JERRY

Yeah. 

GEORGE

(cont'd) she says, 'We have to talk.' 

JERRY

Ugh, the four worst words in the English language. 

GEORGE

That, or 'Who's bra is this?' 

JERRY

That is worse. 

GEORGE

So we order lunch, and we're talking. Finally, she blurts out how it's 'not working'. 

JERRY

Really. 

GEORGE

So, I'm thinking, as she's saying this, I'm thinking: great, the relationship's over. But the egg salad's on the way. So now I have a decision: Do I walk or do I eat? 

JERRY

Hm. You ate. 

GEORGE

We sat there for twenty minutes, chewing, staring at each other in a defunct relationship. 

JERRY

Someone says, 'Get out of my life,' and that doesn't affect your appetite? 

GEORGE

Have you ever had their egg salad? 

JERRY

It is unbelievable. 

GEORGE

It's unbelievable. You know what else is unbelievable? I picked up the check. She didn't even offer. She ended it. The least she could do is send me off with a sandwich. 

JERRY

How much could you possibly have in there? 

GEORGE

It's my money. What should I do? Throw it out the window? I know a guy who took his vacation on his change. 

JERRY

Yeah? Where'd he go, to an arcade? 

GEORGE

(sarcastically) That's funny. You're a funny guy. 

JERRY

C'mon, move up. 

CUSTOMER

Oh great, Ewing's hurt. 

GEORGE

Ewing's hurt? How long is he going to be out? 

CUSTOMER

A couple of days at the most but... 

GEORGE

Geez. 

JERRY

Oh, God. 

GEORGE

I got scared there for a second. The Knicks without Ewing. 

JERRY

Listen, George, little problem with the game. 

GEORGE

What about it? 

JERRY

The thing is, yesterday, I kind of.. uh.. 

GEORGE

What? 

JERRY

I gave your ticket to Horneck. 

GEORGE

(not believing him) You what?! 

JERRY

Yeah, I'm sorry. I had to give it to Horneck. 

GEORGE

No! My ticket?! You gave my ticket to Horneck? 

JERRY

C'mon, c'mon, go ahead, move up. 

GEORGE

Why did you give him my ticket for? 

JERRY

You didn't see him. It was horrible. 

GEORGE

Oh, c'mon, Jerry. I can't believe this. 

JERRY

I had to do it. 

GEORGE

Oh, please. (to the teller) Can you change this into bills? 

TELLER

I'm sorry, sir. We can't do that. 

JERRY

Do you want to go with him? You go. I don't mind. 

GEORGE

I'm not going with him. I don't even know the guy. (to the teller) Look, they did this for me before. 

TELLER

Look, I can give you these and you can roll them yourself. 

GEORGE

You want me to roll six thousand of these?! What, should I quit my job?! 

JERRY

No, I do not like the bank. I've heard the expression 'Laughing all the way to the bank.' I have never seen anyone actually doing it. And those bank lines. I hate it when there's nobody on the line at all, you know that part, you go to the bank, it's empty and you still have to go through the little maze. (walking on the stage like he is going through a maze) 'Can you get a little piece of cheese for me? I'm almost at the front. I'd like a reward for this please.' 

GEORGE

...thirty-two, thirty-three- 

JERRY

George. 

GEORGE

Not now. 

JERRY

Could you stop the counting? 

GEORGE

Nnnnnnngaaa! 

GEORGE

What?! 

JERRY

Can I make it up to you? I'll give you fifty bucks for the jug. 

GEORGE

Oh, yeah, sure. Keep your money. 

JERRY

Well, then I'm not going to the game either. Okay? I'll give him both tickets. 

GEORGE

Oh geeeee. (George pantomimes sticking a knife in his heart, and twists it.) Go, go! 

JERRY

I- no, I don't want to go. 

GEORGE

He was really crying? 

JERRY

I had to give him a tissue. In fact, let me call his machine now and I'll just make up some excuse why I can't go to the game either. 

GEORGE

Wait a minute. Wait a minute. As long as you're going to lie to the guy, why don't you tell him that you lost both of the tickets, then we can go? 

JERRY

George, the man wept. 

KRAMER

Oh, hey guys. Man, I'm telling you, this pizza idea, is really going to happen. 

GEORGE

This is the thing where you go and you have to make your own pizza? 

KRAMER

Yeah, we give you the dough, you smash it, you pound it, you fling it in the air. And then you get to put your sauce and you get to sprinkle your cheese, and then- you slide it into the oven. 

GEORGE

You know, you have to know how to do that. You can't have people shoving their arms into a six-hundred degree oven! 

KRAMER

It's all supervised. 

GEORGE

Oh, well... 

KRAMER

All of it. You want to invest? 

GEORGE

My money's all tied up in change right now. 

KRAMER

No, I'm tellin' you, people, they really want to make their own pizza pie. 

JERRY

I-I have to say something. With all due respect, I just never- I can't imagine anyone in any walk of life, under any circumstance, wanting to make their own pizza pie... but that's me. Alright 

KRAMER

That's you. 

JERRY

I'm just saying..Alright. 

KRAMER

Okay, okay. I just wanted to check with you guys. 

JERRY

Okay. 

KRAMER

You know, this business is going to be big. I just wanted- okay. 

KRAMER

One day, you'll beg me to make your own pie. 

JERRY

(to the phone) Hi, Joel. This is Jerry. I hope you get this before you- Oh, Hi. Joel... Oh, you just came in... Listen, I can't make it to the game tonight... I, uh, have to tutor my nephew... Yeah, he's got an exam tomorrow... Geometry... You know, trapezoids, rhombus... Anyway, listen, you take the tickets. They're at the Will-Call window... And I'm really sorry... Have a good time... We'll talk next week... Okay... Yeah, I don't... Fine.. Fine... Bye. 

GEORGE

Trapezoid? 

JERRY

I know. I'm really running out of excuses with this guy. I need some kind of excuse rolodex. 

ELAINE

Come on, let's go do something. I don't wanna just sit around here. 

JERRY

Okay. 

ELAINE

Want to go get something to eat? 

JERRY

Where do you want to go? 

ELAINE

I don't care, I'm not hungry. 

JERRY

We could go to one of those uh cappuccino places. They let you just sit there. 

ELAINE

What are we gonna do there? Talk? 

JERRY

We could talk. 

ELAINE

I'll go if I don't have to talk. 

JERRY

Then we'll just sit there. 

ELAINE

Okay. I'm gonna check my machine first. (Elaine sees a pad of paper by the phone; reading) Picking someone up at the airport, jury duty, waiting for cable guy... 

JERRY

Okay, just hand that over, please. 

ELAINE

Oh, what is this? 

JERRY

It's a list of excuses, it's for that guy, Horneck, who's at the game tonight with my tickets. I have that list now so in case he calls, I just consult it and I don't have to see him. (Elaine laughs.) I need it. (Elaine starts writing on the list.) What are you doing? 

ELAINE

I got some for you. 

JERRY

I don't need any more. 

ELAINE

No no no no no, these are good. Listen, listen: You ran out of underwear, you can't leave the house. 

JERRY

(not amused) Very funny. 

ELAINE

How about: You've been diagnosed as a multiple personality. You're not even you. You're Dan. 

JERRY

I'm Dan. Can I have my list back, please? 

ELAINE

Here, here. Jerry Seinfeld, I cannot believe you're doing this. This is absolutely infantile. 

JERRY

What can I do? 

ELAINE

Deal with it. Be a man! 

JERRY

Oh no. That's impossible. I'd rather lie to him for the rest of my life that go through that again. He was crying. Tears. Accompanied by mucus. 

ELAINE

You made a man cry? I've never made a man cry. I even kicked a guy in the groin once and he didn't cry. I got the cab. 

JERRY

Couple of tough monkeys. 

KRAMER

Oh, hi Elaine, hey. (to Jerry) Hey, you missed a great game tonight, buddy! 

JERRY

Game? 

KRAMER

Knick game. Horneck took me. We were sitting two rows behind the bench. We're getting hit by sweat! 

JERRY

Wait. How does Horneck know you? 

KRAMER

Last week. When I, you know, gave you the phone. He's really into my pizza place idea! 

JERRY

This is too much. 

ELAINE

Wait, what pizza place idea? 

JERRY

Oh, no. 

KRAMER

You get to make your own pie! 

ELAINE

Oh, that sounds like a great idea. It would be fun. 

KRAMER

Yea. 

JOEL

(from the hallway) Kramer. 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

JERRY

Perfect. 

JOEL

Hey. 

KRAMER

Okay, who wants meatloaf? 

ELAINE

No thanks. 

KRAMER

(to Joel) It's gonna be hot in a minute. 

JOEL

So, I though you were tutoring your nephew? 

JERRY

Oh, we finished early. 

JOEL

M-hm, I'll bet. So, are you going to introduce me to your 'nephew'? 

JERRY

Elaine Benes, this is Joel Horneck. 

ELAINE

Hi. 

JOEL

Whoa, Nelson! This is Elaine? I though you guys split? 

JERRY

We're still friends. 

JOEL

So, thanks again for those tickets. But next week, I'm going to take you. How about next Tuesday night? (to Elaine) And why don't you come along? 

ELAINE

Oh, no no. Tuesday's uh no good becasue we've got choir practice. 

JERRY

Right. I forgot about choir. 

ELAINE

We-We're doing that evening of Eastern European National Anthems. 

JERRY

Right. You know, the Wall being down and everything. 

JOEL

What about Thursday night? I mean they're playing the Sonics. 

ELAINE

Huh... Thursday is no good because we've got to get to the hospital to see if we qualify as those organ donors. 

JOEL

You know, I should really try something like that. 

JERRY

You really should. 

JOEL

Well, let's just take a look here. 

JOEL

Forty-one home games. Let's see saturday night we've got the Mavericks. If you don't like the Mavericks, next Tuesday: Lakers. I mean, you gotta like Magic, right? Let's see, on the road, on the road, on the road, on the road, back on the fourteenth. They play the Bulls. You can't miss Air Jordan... 

JERRY

You know, I really... I've come to the conclusion that there are certain friends in your life that they're just always your friends, and you have to accept it. You see them, you don't really wanna see them. You don't call them, they call you. You don't call back, they call again. The only way to get through talking with people that you don't really have anything in common with is to pretend you're hosting your own little talk show. This is what I do. You pretend there's a little desk around you. The only problem with this is there's no way you can say, 'Hey, it's been great having you on the show. We're out of time.' 

JERRY

I think Superman probably has a very good sense of humor. 

GEORGE

I never heard him say anything really funny. 

JERRY

But it's common sense. He's got super strength, super speed. I'm sure he's got super humor. 

GEORGE

You would think that, but either you're born with a sense of humor, or you're not. It's not going to change even if you go from the red sun of Krypton all the way to the yellow sun of the Earth. 

JERRY

Why? Why would that one area of his mind not be affected by the yellow sun of Earth? 

GEORGE

I don't know. But he ain't funny. 

ELAINE

I know, I know. I'm sorry I'm late. 

JERRY

No problem. 

ELAINE

I dropped a grape. 

GEORGE

Pardon? 

ELAINE

I dropped a grape in the kitchen and it disappeared. I couldn't find it. I was, I was literally on my knees for ten minutes looking for this stupid grape. I have no idea where it went. 

JERRY

Were you crying? I mean, it's just a grape. You'll find it. 

ELAINE

No, I'm just getting over an allergy attack. This guy I'm going out with... 

JERRY

Robert. 

ELAINE

Robert. Yes. Thank you. He has two cats and I'm allergic to them. You know, I finally meet a normal man, and I can't even go into his apartment, you know. And, of course, my apartment is the actor's studio so we can't go there. It's really causing a lot of problems, you know. He won't even go away for the weekend because of these cats. 

GEORGE

Guys with cats... I don't know. 

JERRY

I've been thinking about asking this girl I'm, uh, seeing- 

ELAINE

Vanessa. 

JERRY

Vanessa, thank you. I've been thinking about asking her to go away for a couple of days. 

GEORGE

Oh, no. No no no no no. I'd have to advise against that. What, do you know this woman a month? Let's see, you're going to be with her seventy-two hours. That's a dating decathlon. 

ELAINE

(balancing a spoon on her nose) Hey, why don't you take her to that place in Vermont I was telling you about? You know, that really charming place with the separate faucets for the hot and cold. She'll love it. 

GEORGE

That's exquisite. Listen, uh, if it's not too much trouble, could you pass me that paper over there? 

JERRY

You better find that grape before it mutates into another life form. There was once a mutant grape that terrorized an entire town in the Texas panhandle. They brought in the army, nobody could stop it. Apparently it had a pit of steel. 

GEORGE

Up again?! This is incredible! I'm.. I'm getting it. 

ELAINE

You're getting what? 

GEORGE

A stock. 

JERRY

What stock? 

GEORGE

Did you ever meet my friend, Simons? 

JERRY

Maybe. 

GEORGE

He knows this guy, Wilkinson. He made a fortune in the stock market. Now he's got some new thing. You know, there's supposed to be a big merger. He wasn't even supposed to say anything. You guys should think about doing this too. 

JERRY

How high's it suppose to go? 

GEORGE

I don't know. But Simons said that if I wanted to get involved, that Wilkinson would tell me the exact right minute to sell. You wanna do it? 

JERRY

Boy... I don't know. 

ELAINE

I'd do it but I don't have any money. 

JERRY

What kind of company is it? 

GEORGE

It's called Sendrax. They've got some new kind of technique for televising opera. 

ELAINE

Televising opera? 

GEORGE

Some sort of electronic thingy. 

JERRY

Well, how much are you going to invest? 

GEORGE

Five thousand... Ten. Ten thousand. Five thousand. 

JERRY

Boy... 

GEORGE

C'mon. Wilkinson's got millions invested in this stock. It's gone up three points since I've been watching it. 

JERRY

What if I lose it? 

GEORGE

C'mon, go for twenty-five hundred. We'll do it together. Come on, come on. We're in it together. 

JERRY

All right. Twenty-five hundred. 

GEORGE

That's it. 

WAITRESS

Yeah, can I take your order? 

GEORGE

(Gesturing to Jerry) Check the raiser. 

JERRY

My bet? All right. I'll open with a tuna sandwich. 

ELAINE

Tuna? 

JERRY

Oh, the dolphin thing? 

ELAINE

They're dying in the nets. 

JERRY

Ohhh... You know, the whole concept of lunch is based on tuna. 

ELAINE

Jerry, can't you incorporate one unselfish act in your daily routine? 

JERRY

Hey, when I'm driving, I let people in ahead of me all the time. I'm always waving everybody in. 'Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.' ...All right. All right. I'll have a chicken salad. 

ELAINE

And I'm going to have an English muffin with margarine on the side and a cup of coffee. 

WAITRESS

Okay. (To George) What about you? 

GEORGE

I'll have the tuna. 

JERRY

I have to say, those people talking behind us really ruined that movie for me. 

VANESSA

Why didn't you do something? 

JERRY

What do you want me to do? I gave the guy the half-turn. (acts like he did in the movie) Then I gave him the full-turn with the eye roll. (does the next look) I mean, beyond that, I'm risking a punch in the mouth. (To a stock boy) Excuse me, do you have these in the puffs? 

BOY

No puffs. Just flakes. 

VANESSA

Yeah, I've been thinking about it. 

JERRY

You know, my friend told me about this great place in Vermont. 

VANESSA

I don't know. I just worry about trips like this. It's a lot of pressure. 

JERRY

It's great! It speeds up the intimacy level. It's like putting the relationship in a time compressor. Where we would be six months from now we accomplish (snaps his fingers) three days. 

VANESSA

Oh, so you want to move our relationship into Phase Two? 

JERRY

Exactly. I love Phase Two. Extra toothbrushes, increased phone call frequency, walking around naked. You know, the presents get a lot better in Phase Two. 

VANESSA

Really? Could we go fishing up there? 

JERRY

Yeah. We can fish. What? Blues, carp, marlin? 

VANESSA

They have marlin in Vermont? 

JERRY

Oh, big fighting marlin. (Jerry acts like he is catching a marlin) 

VANESSA

Jerry, the stock is the same as when you checked it earlier. There are no changes after the market closes. The stock is still down. 

JERRY

Is that my paper? 

KRAMER

Bad news, my friend. 

JERRY

What? What news? 

JERRY

Oh, c'mon! It's down again?! 

KRAMER

Two and a half points. 

JERRY

Oh, I can't believe it. Let me see that. (Jerry takes the paper.) That's four and a half points in three days! That's almost half my money! 

KRAMER

Hey, I told you. 

JERRY

(sarcastic) Yeah, you told me. 

KRAMER

It's all manipulated with junk bonds. You can't win. 

JERRY

There's one thing I don't understand. Why does it please you? (to the phone) George Costanza, please. 

KRAMER

Hey, I don't care. I'm just telling you to (yelling) get rid of that stock, now! 

JERRY

(to the phone) George, what's going on?! 

KRAMER

Sell it, just say I'm selling! 

JERRY

(to the phone) Well, where is the guy?!... Nothing?! Almost half my money's gone... Well, call me right back. (Jerry hangs up.) Nobody can reach Wilkinson. He hasn't been home or in his office in the past three days! 

KRAMER

You know, I can't believe you put your money in that Sendrax. And you could've invested in my roll-out tie dispenser. 

JERRY

Roll-out tie dispenser? What was that one? 

KRAMER

Okay, you're in a restaurant. You've got a very big meeting coming up... 

JERRY

Okay... 

KRAMER

(looks at his shirt as if he had a tie on) Oh man, you got mustard on your tie! 

JERRY

(going along with it) Oh No! 

KRAMER

You just (makes the tearing sound) tear it off, and vvvvrrrpppp you got a new one right here. Then you're gone. 

JERRY

You're gone all right. 

KRAMER

(Looking at map) Hey, where, where are you going? You gonna take a trip? The map... what... 

JERRY

Yeah, I'm going to Vermont with uh Vanessa for a few days. 

KRAMER

Hey, can I use your place? I got a bunch of friends coming over this weekend. 

JERRY

What friends? 

KRAMER

Well, it's just some people I met at a rock concert. (Phone rings.) Do you mind if they use your bed? (Jerry give Kramer a look.) 'Cause they're really good people, Jerry. I'm telling you. You know, they're anarchists. They're.. they're.. they're.. huge. 

JERRY

George- What?! You're kidding... Well, what's wrong?... So, what are we gonna do?... Great!... All right, I'll speak to you later. (He hangs up.) Wilkinson, the guy who's supposed to tell us when to sell the stock, he's in the hospital. 

JERRY

So you don't know what's wrong with him? 

GEORGE

All Simons was able to find out is that he's in the hospital. 

JERRY

Okay, fine. Has Simons been in touch with him? 

GEORGE

Of course he's been in touch with him. He's left two messages. He just hasn't heard back yet, that's all. 

JERRY

Well, this is it. I'm selling. 

GEORGE

Just give it a little more time. 

JERRY

I never should've gotten involved in this. I'm a nervous wreck. I'm not cut out for investing. 

GEORGE

All right, all right. That's it. I'm gonna go down there. 

JERRY

Where? 

GEORGE

To the hospital. 

JERRY

The hospital? 

GEORGE

I'm going to find out what's going on. All right? 

JERRY

Are you nuts? You don't even know the guy. 

GEORGE

So what? I'll start talking to him, you know, casual, and I'll work my way around to it. 

JERRY

What if he's in an iron lung or something? What are you gonna do? (Jerry knocks on imaginary glass.) 'How you feeling, Mr. Wilkinson?' (He makes a hissing sound.) 'By the way, what's happening with Sendrax?' 

GEORGE

Maybe he's resting. 

JERRY

Who goes to the hospital to rest? 

GEORGE

What are you, a doctor? 

JERRY

Okay, fine, fine. When are you going down there? 

GEORGE

Today. I'm going today. Just don't do anything until you hear from me. 

JERRY

All right. 

GEORGE

(to the woman) Boy, I have to get to a bathroom. 

CLEANER

(to Jerry) May I help you? 

JERRY

Yeah. I picked up this shirt here yesterday. It's completely shrunk. There's absolutely no way I can wear it. 

CLEANER

When did you bring it in? 

JERRY

What's the difference? Look at it! Do you see the size of this shirt?! 

CLEANER

You got a receipt? 

JERRY

I can't find the receipt. 

CLEANER

You should get the receipt. 

JERRY

Look, forget about the receipt, all right? Even if I had the receipt- look at it! It's a hand puppet. What am I gonna do with this?! 

CLEANER

Yes, but how do I know we did the shirt? 

JERRY

What do you think this is a little scam I have? I take this tiny shirt all over the city conning dry cleaners out of money? In fact, forget the money. I don't even want the money. I just once, I would like to hear a dry cleaner admit that something was their fault. That's what I want. I want an admission of guilt. 

CLEANER

Maybe you asked for it to be washed. 

JERRY

No! Dry-cleaned. 

CLEANE

Let me explain to you something, okay? With certain types of fabrics, different chemicals can react, causing- 

JERRY

You shrunk it! You know you shrunk it! Just tell me that you shrunk it! 

CLEANER

(looks around making sure not too many people are listening) I shrunk it. 

JERRY

I think the only reason we go to the dry cleaner is so I can say to the dry cleaner, 'Well, it's ruined.' And of course, the dry cleaner can respond, 'It's not our fault. We're not responsible. We just ruin the clothes. That ends our legal obligation.' You see, the whole problem with dry cleaning is that we all believe that this is actually possible. Th-Right? They're cleaning our clothes, but they're not getting anything wet. It's all dry. I know there's gotta be some liquids back there, some fluids that they're using. There's no such thing as dry cleaning. When you get something on your shirt, ever get something on your shirt and try to get it off like that (Jerry brushes off his shirt.) That's dry cleaning. I don't think that's what they're doing back there. They don't have eighty guys going, 'Come on, hurry up! There's a lot of shirts today!' 

JERRY

Bless you. 

ELAINE

Thank you. What evidence is there that cats are so smart, anyway? Huh? What do they do? Because they're clean? I am sorry. My Uncle Pete showers four times a day and he can't count to ten, so don't give me hygiene. 

ELAINE

I don't know. I can't think of any solution, unless of course they should meet with some unfortunate accident. What do you think a hit man would charge to rub out a couple of cats? 

JERRY

Well, it couldn't be too expensive. Thirteen, fourteen bucks a cat? 

ELAINE

What do you think, Jerry? You wanna make twenty-eight bucks? 

JERRY

I'm no cat killer. 

ELAINE

How about we go over there right now and we shave them? 

JERRY

I'd really like to go, Elaine. But, George is coming back from the hospital. I gotta wait for him. But otherwise I would definitely go. 

ELAINE

He actually went to the hospital? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

ELAINE

Oh man, he's nuts. 

JERRY

Yeah, he's nuts. You wanta bump off a couple of cats. (Enter Kramer, holding a paper up to Jerry.) I know, I know. It's down again. 

KRAMER

How much are you down altogether? 

JERRY

I don't know.. fifteen hundred dollars. 

KRAMER

Wow. 

JERRY

You don't have to say 'Wow.' I know it's 'Wow.' (Kramer smiling) And there's that smile again. Well, what is that? (Intercom buzzes.) It's George. 

KRAMER

Oh, look at this one by the bus stop. Jerry, come here. Take a look at this. 

JERRY

I really don't need to look. 

KRAMER

What a body. Yeeaahh. That's for me. 

JERRY

Yeah, and you're just what she's looking for too ' a stranger leering through a pair of binoculars ten floors up. 

KRAMER

I'm gonna go down there and try and talk to her. 

JERRY

What? What? Did you go down there? (George nods.) Did he tell you what's gonna happen? (George shakes his head.) How long were you there? 

GEORGE

Fifteen seconds. 

JERRY

You told him you knew Simons? 

GEORGE

Yeah, I mentioned Simons. Next thing I know, I'm in the parking lot. Perhaps they had some sort of a falling out. I'll tell you one thing. I don't know what he's got. But for a sick guy, he's very strong. 

JERRY

Well, that's it. Look, I'm going to Vermont. I don't want to think about this. I'm selling. 

ELAINE

Didn't work, huh? 

GEORGE

(laughs) Not quite. 

ELAINE

We-Well, what are you gonna do about the stock? 

GEORGE

I'm keeping it. I'm going down with the ship. 

JERRY

So I know this guy. I'm getting all my sneakers at a discount now. 

VANESSA

I know. You mentioned it. 

JERRY

Oh yeah, right. 

JERRY

(thinking) Oh God. Get me out of here. What a mistake. What made me think this would work? And I've still got another day! I've got nothing left to say. Wait... wait... Got one. (to Vanessa) That's a nice watch. Do you wind it? 

VANESSA

No, it's got a little battery. 

JERRY

Well, that's good. 

JERRY

(thinking) Well, the drive home should be a delight. I'm speeding the whole way. Let them throw me in jail. I don't care. (to Vanessa) That's the manager? Do you want me to see if we can get another room? 

VANESSA

No, it's okay. 

JERRY

So, I guess you don't find the separate faucets for the hot and cold, charming? 

VANESSA

Not especially. 

JERRY

Well, what do you want to do this afternoon? 

VANESSA

What can we do? It's raining. 

JERRY

We cold play 'Sorry!' We cold play 'Steal the Old Man's Bundle.' (Vanessa not amused; Jerry thinking) Maybe I can get an extension cord and hang myself. (to Vanessa) What kind of perfume is that you're wearing? 

VANESSA

Oh, you've never heard of it. 

JERRY

No, what? What kind is it? 

VANESSA

I can't tell you. 

JERRY

(thinking) Yeah, that's normal. (to a man nearby) Excuse me, sir. Could I have a look at that business section? 

VANESSA

That stock? I thought you got out of that? 

JERRY

I did. I'm just curious. It's been almost a week. I want to check it out. (He finds the stock.) Six points? (to Vanessa) It's up six points! 

VANESSA

I told you not to sell. 

JERRY

You did not tell me not to sell. 

VANESSA

I said the market fluctuates. Remember? 

JERRY

Look, Vanessa, of course the market fluctuates. Everybody knows that. I just got fluctuated out of four thousand dollars! 

VANESSA

That's probably why we're- 

JERRY

What? 

VANESSA

Forget it. 

JERRY

No, what? 'That's probably why..' 

VANESSA

That's probably why we're staying here, because you lost money on the stock. 

JERRY

(thinking) So, what am I looking at here? Twenty-nine hours to go. Well, at least I got plenty of time to find out the name of that perfume... 

GEORGE

(laughing) Have something else. C'mon, have a little dessert? 

GEORGE

Elaine, get something! It's all taken care of. 

ELAINE

I'm kinda full. 

GEORGE

So don't finish it. 

JERRY

(acidly) She's full. So, Big Daddy. I'm just curious. How much did you clear on your little transaction there, all told? 

GEORGE

I don't like to discuss figures. 

JERRY

How much? 

GEORGE

I don't know, what? Eight thousand. It's a Hyundai. Get out of here. I told you not to sell. Simons made money, Wilkinson cleaned up. 

JERRY

So, Wilkinson's out of the hospital now? 

ELAINE

Oh god. 

JERRY

Is that still from the cats? 

ELAINE

No, I just have a cold. 

JERRY

So, what ever happened with that? 

ELAINE

I gave him an ultimatum. 

GEORGE

He chose the cats? 

ELAINE

They're very clean animals. 

JERRY

I gotta say, that's pretty sad. Losing out to a cat. 

ELAINE

Almost as bad as losing out to a perfume. 

GEORGE

I told you those trips were relationship killers. Too bad you can't get your buddy Superman to fly around the Earth at super speed and reverse time. You'd get all the money back, you could have avoided the whole trip to Vermont... 

ELAINE

Superman can go back in time? 

JERRY

We went over that. 

GEORGE

Pst. (moves in close with Elaine and Jerry) Wilkinson's got a bite on a new one. Petramco Corp. Out of, uh Springfield. I think. They're about to introduce some sort of a robot butcher. 

JERRY

A robot butcher? 

GEORGE

Shhhhh. If you want to get in, there's very little time. (calling to the waitress) Sweetheart.. (Waitress approaches and tears off a check. George stops her.) No, no, no. That ought to cover it. (He hands her some money; she turns to leave; George stops her.) Just a second. Just a... let me jus-peek... (He looks at the check, then takes some money out of her hand. George urges Jerry and Elaine to eat.) Come on, come on, come on... 

JERRY

I'm not an investor. People always tell me, you should have your money working for you. I've decided I'll do the work. I'm gonna let the money relax. You know what I mean? 'Cause you send your money out there ' working for you ' a lot of times, it gets fired. You go back there, 'What happened? I had my money. It was here, it was working for me.' 'Yeah, I remember your money. Showing up late. Taking time off. We had to let him go.' 

GEORGE

She can't kill me right? 

JERRY

No, of course not. 

GEORGE

People break up all the time. 

JERRY

Everyday. 

GEORGE

It just didn't work out. What can I do? I wanted to love her. I tried to love her. I couldn't. 

JERRY

You tried. 

GEORGE

I kept looking at her face. I'd go, 'C'mon, love her. Love her!' 

JERRY

Did you tell her you loved her? 

GEORGE

Oh, I had no choice. She squeezed it out of me! She'd tell me she loved me. All right, at first, I just look at her. I'd go, 'Oh, really? Or uh, Boy, that's, that's something.' But, eventually you have to come back with, 'Well, I love you.' You know, you can only hold out for so long.' 

JERRY

You're a human being. 

GEORGE

And I didn't even ask her out. She asked me out first. She called me up. What was I supposed to do? Say no? (laughs) I can't do that to someone. 

JERRY

You're too nice a guy. 

GEORGE

I am. I'm a nice guy. And she seduced me! We were in my apartment, I'm sitting on the couch, she's on the chair. I get up to go to the bathroom, I come back, she's on the couch. What am I supposed to do? Not do anything? I couldn't do that. I would've insulted her. 

JERRY

You're flesh and blood. 

GEORGE

I had nothing to do wtih any of this! I met all her friends, I didn't want to meet them. I kept trying to avoid it. I knew it would only get me in deeper. But they were everywhere! They kept popping up all over the place. 'This is Nancy, this is Susan, this is Amy, this is my cousin, this is my brother, this is my father...' It's like I'm in quicksand. 

JERRY

I told you when I met her. 

GEORGE

My back is killing me. 

JERRY

You gotta go to my chiropractor, he's the best. 

GEORGE

Oh yeah, everybody's guy is the best. 

JERRY

I'm gonna make an appointment for you. We'll go together. 

GEORGE

Please. They don't do anything. Look, do I have to break up with her in person? Can't I do it over the phone? I-I have no stomach for these things. 

JERRY

You should just do it like a Band-Aid. One motion! Right off! 

ELAINE

Hi. 

JERRY

Hi. 

ELAINE

Hey, what are you doing? 

GEORGE

I'm letting you in. 

ELAINE

Oh no. No. I don't want to sit in the back. I'll be left out of the conversation. 

GEORGE

No, you won't. 

ELAINE

Yes, I will, George. I'll have to stick my chin on top of the seat. 

GEORGE

Okay. 

ELAINE

Why can't you sit in the middle? 

GEORGE

Please, it doesn't look good. Boy, boy, girl. 

ELAINE

You're afraid to sit next to a man. You're a little homophobic, aren't ya? 

GEORGE

Is it that obvious? 

ELAINE

Hello, Jerry. 

JERRY

Hello. 

ELAINE

Did you get a haircut? 

JERRY

No, shower. So, where are we eating? 

ELAINE

Tell me if you think this is strange. There's this guy who lives in my building, who I was introduced to a couple of years ago by a friend. He's a uh teacher, or something. Anyway, after we met, whenever we'd run into each other on the street, or in the lobby, or whatever, we would stop and we would chat a little. Nothing much. Little pleasantries. He's a nice guy, he's got a family. Then after a while, I noticed there was not more stopping. Just saying hello and continuing on our way. And then the verbal hellos stopped, and we just went into these little sort of nods of recognition. So, fine. I figure, that's where this relationship is finally gonna settle: polite nodding. Then one day, he doesn't nod. Like I don't exist?! He went from nods to nothing. 

GEORGE

(singing; imitating Tony Bennett) 'You know, I'd go from nods to nothing...' 

ELAINE

And now, there's this intense animosity whenever we pass. I mean, it's like we really hate each other. It's based on nothing. 

JERRY

A relationship is an organism. You created this thing and then you starved it so it turned against you. Same thing happened in 'The Blob'. 

GEORGE

I think you absolutely have to say something to this guy. Confront him. 

ELAINE

Really? 

GEORGE

Yes. 

ELAINE

You would do that? 

GEORGE

If I was a different person. 

JERRY

Hello... Hello. Is Glen there?... I'm sorry. Is this 805-555-3234?... Yes, I know I have the wrong number, but I just want to know if I dialed wrong or if... 

KRAMER

(to the intercom) Come on up. 

JERRY

(to the phone) Oh, it's you again. See, now if you had answered me, I wouldn't have had to do this. Now that's two long distance calls I made to you why can't you... (The guy hangs up on Jerry again; to nobody) Why? Why do they just hang up like that? Thank you very much. 

KRAMER

Taste this. 

JERRY

No, I just had a sandwich. 

KRAMER

No, taste it. Taste it. 

JERRY

I don't want cantaloupe now. 

KRAMER

You've never had cantaloupe like this before... 

JERRY

I only eat cantaloupe at certain times... 

KRAMER

...Jerry. This is great cantaloupe. 

JERRY

...all right! 

KRAMER

Uh-huh. It's good? 

JERRY

It's very good. 

KRAMER

Good, huh? 

JERRY

Good. 

KRAMER

I got it at Joe's. 

JERRY

Uh-huh. 

KRAMER

Forty-nine cents a pound. That's practically half than what you're paying at the supermarket. I don't know why you don't go to Joe's. 

JERRY

It's too far. 

KRAMER

It's three blocks further. You can use my shopping cart.. 

JERRY

I'm not pulling a shopping cart. What, am I suppose to wear a kerchief? Put stockings on and roll 'em down below my knee? 

KRAMER

See, the other thing is, if you don't like anything, he takes it right back. 

JERRY

I don't return fruit. Fruit is a gamble. I know that going in. 

GEORGE

I'm outta there. I did it! It's over. 

JERRY

You did it? What happened? 

GEORGE

I told her. In the kitchen ' which was risky 'cause it's near all the knives. I started with the word 'Listen.' 

JERRY

Uh-huh... 

GEORGE

I said, 'Listen Marlene,' and then the next thing I know, I'm in the middle of it. And there's this voice inside of me going, 'You're doing it! You're doing it!' And then she started to cry, and I weakened a bit. I almost relented, but the voice, Jerry, the voice said, 'Keep going, keep going. You're almost out!' It's like I was making a prison break, you know, and I'm heading for the wall, and I trip and I twist my ankle, and they throw the light on you, you know. So, somehow I get though the crying and I keep running. Then the cursing started. She's firing at me from the guard tower. 'Son of a bang! Son of a boom!' I get to the top of the wall ' the front door. I opened it up, I'm one foot away, I took one last look around the penitentiary, and I jumped! 

JERRY

See, it's never as bad as you imagine. 

KRAMER

I liked Marlene. What's her number? 

GEORGE

Uh, no, I, I don't think so. 

JERRY

(to Kramer) Could you stop that smacking? 

KRAMER

George, I want you to taste this cantaloupe. 

GEORGE

Oh no, thank you. 

KRAMER

It's the best cantaloupe I ever had. 

GEORGE

No, really. No, no, thanks. 

KRAMER

Jerry, tell him how good this cantaloupe is. 

JERRY

It's very good cantaloupe. (Kramer leaves; to George) So that's it? You're out? 

GEORGE

Except for one small problem. Hah, I left some books in her apartment. 

JERRY

So, go get them. 

GEORGE

Oh, no no, I can't go back there. Jerry, it's so awkward and, you know, it could be dangerous sexually. Something could happen, I'd be right back where I started from. 

JERRY

So forget about the books. Did you read them? 

GEORGE

Well, yeah. 

JERRY

What do you need them for? 

GEORGE

I don't know. They're books. 

JERRY

What is this obsession people have with books? They put them in their houses like they're trophies. What do you need it for after you read it? 

GEORGE

They're my books. 

JERRY

So you want me to get the books? Is that it? 

MARLENE

...so, it must've been ninety-five degrees that night, and everyone's just standing around the pool with little drinks in their hands. I was wearing my old jeans and t-shirt. And I don't know, I was just in one of those moods. So I said to myself, 'Marlene, just do it.' And I jumped in. And as I'm getting out, I feel all these eyes on me, and I look up and everyone is just staring at me. 

JERRY

So what'd you do? 

MARLENE

Well, nothing. It's no skin off my hide if people like to look. I just didn't see what the big attraction was. 

JERRY

Well, I have a general idea what it was. I could take a guess. 

MARLENE

Hey, you know, Jerry, just because George and I don't see each other anymore, it doesn't mean we shouldn't stay friends. 

JERRY

No. 

MARLENE

Good enough. I'm really glad we got that settled. 

JERRY

I don't know how this happened. 

GEORGE

Jerry, it's not my fault. 

JERRY

No, no. It's not your fault. 'Books, books, I need my books.' Have you re-read those books yet, by the way? You know the great thing? When you read Moby Dick the second time, Ahab and the whale become good friends. You know, it's not like Marlene's a bad person or anything, but, my God! I mean, we've had like three lunches and a movie, and she never stops calling. (George nods.) And it's these meaningless, purposeless, blather calls. She never asks if I'm busy or anything. I just pick up the phone, and she's in the middle of a sentence! 

GEORGE

It's standard. Has she left you one of those messages where she uses up the whole machine? 

JERRY

(disgusted) Ohh! You know, and sometimes she'll go, (imitates Marlene) 'Hello, Jerry?' And I'll go, 'Oh, hi Marlene.' And then it's 'Jerry...' 

GEORGE

'I dunno sometimes...' 

GEORGE

What trying to get off the phone? 

JERRY

(more disgusted) Ohhhh! You can't! It's impossible! There's no break in the conversation where you can go, 'All right then...' You know, it just goes on and on and on without a break in the wall. I mean, I gotta put a stop to this. 

GEORGE

Just do it like a Band-Aid. One motion. Right off! (beat) She is sexy though. Don't you think? 

JERRY

Yeah. Yes, she is. 

RECEPTIONIST

Mr. Costanza? 

GEORGE

Yeah. 

RECEPTIONIST

The doctor will see you now. 

GEORGE

(to Jerry, sarcastically) Yeah, doctor. I'm going to have to wait in that little room all by myself, aren't I? (He picks up a crossword puzzle.) I better take this. I hate the little room. (George walks into the hallway that leads to the doctor's office.) 'Oh, hello, Doctor.' 

JERRY

The waiting room. I hate when they make you wait in the room. 'Cause it says 'Waiting Room.' There's no chance of not waiting. 'Cause they call it the waiting room, they're gonna use it. They've got it. It's all set up for you to wait. And you sit there, you know, and you've got your little magazine. You pretend you're reading it, but you're really looking at the other people. You know, you're thinking about about them. Things like, 'I wonder what he's got. As soon as she goes, I'm getting her magazine.' And then, they finally call you and it's a very exciting moment. They finally call you, and you stand up and you kinda look around at the other people in the room. 'Well, I guess I've been chosen. I'll see you all later.' You know, so you think you're going to see the doctor, but you're not, are you? No. You're going into the next waiting room ' the littler waiting room. But if they are, you know, doing some sort of medical thing to you, you want to be in the smallest room that they have, I think. You don't wnat to be in the largest room that they have. You know what I mean? You ever see these operating theaters, that they have, with like, stadium seating? You don't want them doing anything to you that makes other doctors go, 'I have to see this! Are you kidding? Are they really gonna do that to him? Are there seats? Can we get in?' Do they scalp tickets to these things? 'I got two for the Winslow tumor, I got two...' 

JERRY

So, how was it? 

GEORGE

I was in there for two minutes. He didn't do anything. Touch this, feel that ' seventy-five bucks! 

JERRY

Well, it's a first visit. 

GEORGE

What's seventy-five bucks?! What, am I seeing Sinatra in there?! Am I being entertained? I don't understand this. I'm only paying half. 

JERRY

You can't do that. 

GEORGE

Why not? 

JERRY

He's a doctor. You gotta pay what he says. 

GEORGE

Oh, no no no. I pay what I say. 

MARLENE

Are you feeling weird? 

JERRY

No, I'm fine. 

MARLENE

Nothing really happened. 

JERRY

Yeah, I know. 

MARLENE

We just kissed a little. People kiss. 

JERRY

Yeah. 

MARLENE

Well... night. 

JERRY

(belated) Good night. 

KRAMER

Hey. 

JERRY

Hey. 

KRAMER

I got it! This time, I got it! 

KRAMER

Hips! See, it's all hips. 

JERRY

Uh-huh. 

KRAMER

You gotta come through with the hips first. 

JERRY

That is out there. 

KRAMER

Joe's? 

JERRY

No, supermarket. 

KRAMER

Well, is it good? 

JERRY

It's uh okay. 

KRAMER

Let me taste it. 

KRAMER

See, that stinks. You can't eat that. You should take that back. 

JERRY

I'm not taking it back. 

KRAMER

All right, I'll take it back. I'm going by there. 

JERRY

I don't care about it. 

KRAMER

Jerry, you should care. Cantaloupe like this should be taken out of circulation. 

JERRY

All right. Take it back. 

MESSAGE

'Leave a message, I'll call you back.' 

MARLENE

(from the phone) Jerry, have you ever taken a bath in the dark? If I'm not talking into the soap right now, call me back. 

KRAMER

Well? 

JERRY

Marlene. 

KRAMER

(smiles) Oh. Oh, Marlene... 

JERRY

Yeah, I took her home one night ' we kinda started up a little bit in the car. 

KRAMER

I thought you were trying to get rid of her? 

JERRY

I was. But, she's got me, like, hypnotized. 

KRAMER

Does George know? 

JERRY

No, he'd go nuts. 

KRAMER

Yeah, no kidding. 

JERRY

I feel terrible. (Kramer smiling) I mean, I've seen her a couple of times since then, and I know I can't go any further, but... She's just got this like, psychosexual hold over me. I just want her, I can't breathe. It's like a drug. 

KRAMER

Whoa, psychosexual. 

JERRY

I don't know how I'm going to tell him. 

KRAMER

Man, I don't understand people. I mean, why would George want to deprive you of pleasure? Is it just me? 

JERRY

It's partially you, yeah. 

KRAMER

You're his friend. Better that she should sleep with someone else? Some jerk that he doesn't even know? 

JERRY

Well, he can't kill me, right? 

KRAMER

You're a human being. 

JERRY

I mean, she called me. I haven't called her. She started it. 

KRAMER

You're flesh and blood. 

JERRY

I'm a nice guy. 

ELAINE

Hi. 

JERRY

(excited) Oh, my little airplane lamp. 

ELAINE

You know, you have the slowest elevator in the entire city. That's hard to get used to when you're in so many other fast ones. 

JERRY

Well, the apartment elevators are always slower than the offices, because you don't have to be home on time. 

ELAINE

Unless you're married to a dictator. 

JERRY

Yeah... Because they would be very demanding people. 

ELAINE

Right. Exactly. So I imagine at some point somebody's going to offer me some cantaloupe? 

KRAMER

Nope. No good. 

JERRY

Well, you know what they say. Lucky in love, Unlucky with fruit. 

KRAMER

Well, I'm taking this back. 

ELAINE

So, I had what you might call a little encounter this morning. 

JERRY

Really? That guy who stopped saying hello? 

ELAINE

Yes. 

JERRY

You talked to him? 

ELAINE

Yes. I spotted him getting his mail. And at first, I was just going to walk on by, but then I thought, 'No no no. No. Do not be afraid of this man.' 

JERRY

Right. 

ELAINE

So, I walked up behind him and I tapped him on the shoulder. And I said, 'Hi, remember me?' And he furrows his brow, as if he's really trying to figure it out. So I said to him, I said, 'You little phony. You know exactly who I am.' 

JERRY

You said 'you little phony'? 

ELAINE

I did. I most certainly did. And he said, he goes, 'Oh, yeah. You're Jeanette's friend. We did meet once.' And I said, 'Well, how do you go from that to totally ignoring a person when they walk by?' 

JERRY

This is amazing. 

ELAINE

And he says, he says, 'Look, I just didn't want to say hello anymore, All right?' And I said, 'Fine. Fine. I didn't want to say hello anymore either, but just I wanted you to know that I'm aware of it!' 

JERRY

You are the Queen of Confrontation. You're my new hero. In fact, you've inspired me. I'm gonna call George about something right now. 

ELAINE

This cantaloupe stinks. 

GEORGE

(considers for a second) I don't care. 

JERRY

You're kidding. 

GEORGE

No, I don't care. 

JERRY

You mean that? 

GEORGE

Absolutely. 

JERRY

You don't care? 

GEORGE

No. 

JERRY

How could you not care? 

GEORGE

I don't know. But I don't. I'm actually almost happy to hear it. 

JERRY

I thought you'd be upset. 

GEORGE

I guess I should be, but I'm not. 

JERRY

Am I a bad person? Did I do something terrible? 

GEORGE

You're a fine person. You're a humanitarian. She's very sexy. 

JERRY

That voice. That voice. She's driving me crazy. 

GEORGE

I know. I know. 

JERRY

So I can see her tonight, and you don't care? 

GEORGE

See her tonight. See her tomorrow. Go. Knock yourself out. She's too crazy for me. 

JERRY

All right. As long as you're okay. Because I can't stop thinking about her. 

GEORGE

I'm okay. I'm fine. I'm wonderful. I never felt better in my whole life. 

JERRY

Good. And I'll tell you what... You don't have to pay me back the thirty-five I gave to the chiropractor for the rest of your bill. 

GEORGE

(shocked and angry) You paid that crook?! 

JERRY

I had to. 

GEORGE

He didn't do anything, Jerry. It's a scam! Who told you to do that? 

JERRY

It was embarrassing to me. 

GEORGE

Oh, I was trying to make a point. 

JERRY

Why don't you make a point with your own doctor? (George gulps.) What's wrong? 

GEORGE

(gasping) I think I swallowed a fly! I swallowed a fly! What do I do? (He turns to a coffee shop patron at the counter.) What can happen?! 

JERRY

So, you wanna come up for a few minutes? 

MARLENE

I'm sorry, Jerry. I just don't think this is gonna work. 

JERRY

Really? I thought... 

MARLENE

I know, I'm sorry. 

JERRY

Gee, I just didn't expect it from the way you've been acting. 

MARLENE

You sure you want to talk about this? 'Cause I sure don't. 

JERRY

Of course I want to talk about it. 

MARLENE

Well, okay. I guess things changed for me on Tuesday night. 

JERRY

Tuesday night? What happened Tuesday night? 

MARLENE

I saw your act. 

JERRY

My act? Wha-What does that have to do with anything? 

MARLENE

Well, to be honest, it just didn't make it for me. It's just so much fluff. 

JERRY

I can't believe this. So what are you saying? You didn't like my act, so that's it? 

MARLENE

I can't be with someone if I don't respect what they do. 

JERRY

You're a cashier! 

MARLENE

Look, Jerry, it's just wasn't my kind of humor. 

JERRY

You can't go by the audience that night. It was late. They were terrible. 

MARLENE

I heard the material. 

JERRY

I have other stuff. Y-You should come see me on the weekend. 

JERRY

Women need to like the job of the guy they're with. If they don't like the job, they don't like the guy. Men know this. Which is why we make up the phony, bogus names for the jobs that we have. 'Well, right now, I'm the regional management supervisor. I'm in development, research, consulting...' Men on the other hand ' if they are physically attracted to a woman ' are not that concerned with her job. Are we? Men don't really care. Men'll just go, 'Really? Slaughterhouse? Is that where you work? That sounds interesting. So whaddaya got a big cleaver there? You're just lopping their heads off? That sounds great! Listen, why don't you shower up, and we'll get some burgers and catch a movie.' 

HELEN

You have so many nice jackets. I don't know why you had to bring this jacket. Who wears a jacket like this? What's wrong with that nice gray one? You have beautiful clothes. They sit in your closet. Morty, you can't wear this! 

MORTY

Are you getting that? 

HELEN

I thought you were getting it. 

MORTY

Should I pick up? 

HELEN

You want me to get that? 

MORTY

I'll get it! 

HELEN

I'll get it! 

HELEN

Hello?... Hello? 

JERRY

Hi. 

HELEN

Hi. 

JERRY

(to Morty) Would you make this thing lower! I can hear it on the street! 

MORTY

So, how'd you do? 

JERRY

We won. I made an incredible play in the field! There was a tag-up at third base and I threw the guy out from left field on a fly! We'll be in the championship game Wednesday because of me. It was the single greatest moment in my life. 

HELEN

This is your greatest moment? A game? 

JERRY

Well, no. Sharon Besser, of course. 

MORTY

You know what my greatest moment was, don't you? Nineteen-forty-six. I went to work for Harry Flemming and I came up with the idea for the beltless trenchcoat. 

HELEN

Jerry, look at this sport jacket. Is this a jacket to wear to an anniversary party? 

JERRY

Well, the man's an individualist ' he worked for Harry Flemming. He knows what he's doing. 

HELEN

But it's their 50th anniversary. 

MORTY

Your mother doesn't like my taste in clothing. 

HELEN

You know, I spoke to Manya and Isaac on the phone today. They invited you again. I think you should go. 

JERRY

First of all, I made plans with Elaine. 

HELEN

So bring her. 

JERRY

I don't even know them. What is she, your second cousin? I mean, I've met them three times in my life. 

MORTY

I don't know her either. (gesturing to Helen) She makes me fly all the way from Florida for this, and then she criticizes my jacket. 

HELEN

At least come and say hello, have a cup of coffee, then you'll leave. 

MORTY

How come he gets to leave? 

JERRY

If I wind up sitting next to Uncle Leo, I am leaving. He's always grabbing my arm when he talks to me. I guess it's because so many people have left in the middle of his conversation. 

MORTY

And it's always about Jeffrey, right? 

JERRY

Yeah. He talks about him like he split the atom. The kid works for the Parks Department. 

KRAMER

Morty, are you coming in? 

MORTY

Oh, yeah. I forgot all about it. 

KRAMER

(to Jerry) Hey, how'd you do? 

JERRY

We won. We're in the finals on Wednesday. 

KRAMER

Yeah! 

JERRY

(to Kramer and Morty) What is this about? 

KRAMER

I'm completely changing the configuration of the apartment. You're not gonna believe it when you see it. A whole new lifestyle. 

JERRY

What are you doing? 

KRAMER

Levels. 

JERRY

Levels? 

KRAMER

Yeah, I'm getting rid of all my furniture. All of it. And I'm going to build these different levels, with steps, and it'll all be carpeted with a lot of pillows. You know, like ancient Egypt. 

JERRY

You drew up plans for this? 

KRAMER

No no. It's all in my head. 

MORTY

I don't know how you're going to be comfortable like that. 

KRAMER

Oh, I'll be comfortable. 

JERRY

When do you intend to do this? 

KRAMER

Ohh... should be done by the end of the month. 

JERRY

You're doing this yourself? 

KRAMER

It's a simple job. Why, you don't think I can? 

JERRY

Oh, no. It's not that I don't think you can. I know that you can't, and I'm positive that you won't. 

KRAMER

Well, I got the tools. I got the pillows. All I need is the lumber. 

MORTY

Hey, that's some big job. 

JERRY

I, don't see it happening. 

KRAMER

Well, this time, this time you're wrong. C'mon. I'll even bet you. 

JERRY

Seriously? 

HELEN

I don't want you betting. Morty, don't let him bet. 

KRAMER

A big dinner with dessert. But I've got till the end of the month. 

JERRY

I'll give you a year. 

KRAMER

No no no. End of the month. 

JERRY

It's a bet. 

JERRY

(to Elaine) Seriously, do you wanna switch chairs? 

ELAINE

No, no. I'm fine. 

LEO

Jerry, are you listening to this? 

JERRY

Yeah, Uncle Leo. 

LEO

So, so, now the parks commissioner is recommending Jeffrey for a citation. 

JERRY

Right. For the reducing of the pond scum? 

LEO

No, for the walking tours. 

JERRY

Oh, yeah. Where the people eat the plant life. The edible foliage tour. 

LEO

That's exactly right. He knows the whole history of the park. For two hours he's talking and answering questions. But you want to know something? Whenever he has a problem with one of these high-powered big shots in the Parks Department, you know who he calls? 

JERRY

Mickey Mantle? 

ELAINE

(saving Jerry from Leo) Jerry, Jerry. Did you taste these peas? (to Manya) These peas are great! 

JERRY

(eating a forkful) These peas are bursting with country fresh flavor. 

ELAINE

Mmm... phenomenal peas. 

MORTY

Are you ready for dessert? 

JERRY

Well, actually, we do have to kind of get going. 

MANYA

(surprised) You're going? 

ELAINE

Oh uh, I don't really eat dessert. I'm dieting. 

JERRY

Yeah, I can't eat dessert either. The sugar makes my ankles swell up, and I can't dance. 

HELEN

He's kidding, Manya. 

MANYA

Is that a joke? 

HELEN

So, did you hear Claire's getting married? 

MANYA

Yeah, yeah.. 

HELEN

I hear the fella owns a couple of racehorses. You know, trotters, like at Yonkers. 

JERRY

Horses? They're like big riding dogs. 

ELAINE

What about ponies? What kind of abnormal animal is that? And those kids who had their own ponies... 

JERRY

I know, I hated those kids. In fact, I hate anyone that ever had a pony when they were growing up. 

MANYA

(angry) I had a pony. 

JERRY

Well, I didn't uh really mean a pony, per se... 

MANYA

When I was a little girl in Poland, we all had ponies. My sister had pony, my cousin had pony... So, what's wrong with that? 

JERRY

Nothing. Nothing at all. I was just merely expressing... 

HELEN

Should we have coffee? Who's having coffee? 

MANYA

He was a beautiful pony! And I loved him. 

JERRY

Well, I'm sure you did. Who wouldn't love a pony? Who wouldn't love a person that had a pony? 

MANYA

You! You said so! 

JERRY

No, see, we didn't have ponies. I'm sure at that time in Poland, they were very common. They were probably like compact cars.. 

MANYA

That's it! I had enough! 

ISAAC

Have your coffee, everybody. She's a little upset. It's been an emotional day. 

JERRY

I didn't know she had a pony. How was I to know she had a pony? Who figures an immigrant's going to have a pony? Do you know what the odds are on that? I mean, in all the pictures I saw of immigrants on boats coming into New York harbor, I never saw one of them sittin' on a pony. Why would anybody come here if they had a pony? Who leaves a country packed with ponies to come to a non-pony country? It doesn't make sense. Am I wrong? 

JERRY

I'll drive you to the airport. 

HELEN

No, we're taking a cab. 

JERRY

I just hope that whole pony incident didn't put a damper on the trip. 

HELEN

Don't be ridiculous. It was a misunderstanding. 

MORTY

Hey, I agree with him. Nobody likes a kid with a pony. 

JERRY

Well, if you ever talk to her, tell her I'm sorry. Elaine too. She feels terrible. 

HELEN

You know, you should give Manya a call. 

JERRY

Maybe I will. 

KRAMER

Oh, hi. I uh just came to say goodbye. 

KRAMER

Need any help with those? 

MORTY

It's nothing. I got it. So, how are your levels coming along? 

KRAMER

Oh, well... I decided I'm not gonna do it. 

JERRY

(laughing) Really? What a shock. 

HELEN

Goodbye, Jerry. 

JERRY

Take care. 

HELEN

We'll call you. 

MORTY

Bye, Jer. 

JERRY

Bye, Dad. Take it easy. 

MORTY

Bye, Mr. Kramer. 

KRAMER

Yeah. So long, Morty. 

JERRY

So, when do I get my dinner? 

KRAMER

There's no dinner. The bet's off. I'm not gonna do it. 

JERRY

Yes, I know you're not gonna do it. That's why I bet. 

KRAMER

Ya well, there's no bet if I'm not doing it. 

JERRY

That's the bet! That you're not doing it! 

KRAMER

Yeah, well, I could do it. I don't wanna do it. 

JERRY

We didn't bet on if you wanted to. We bet on if it would be done. 

KRAMER

And it could be done. 

JERRY

Well, of course it could be done! Anything could be done! But it only is done if it's done! Show me the levels! The bet is the levels! 

KRAMER

I don't want the levels! 

JERRY

That's the bet! (The phone rings; Jerry answers it.) Hello?... No- oh, hi... (Kramer leaves) no, they just left... Oh, my God... hang on a second. Maybe I can still catch 'em. (Jerry goes over to the window and opens it; calling out the window) Ma! Ma! Up here! Don't get in the cab! Manya died! Manya died!! 

HELEN

Who did you talk to? 

JERRY

Uncle Leo. 

HELEN

And when's the funeral? 

JERRY

I don't know. He said he'd call back. 

MORTY

You know what this means, don't you? We lost the Supersaver. Those tickets are non-refundable. 

HELEN

She just had a check-up. The doctor said she was fine. Unless... 

JERRY

What? 

HELEN

What? Nothing. 

JERRY

You don't think... What? The pony remark? 

HELEN

Oh, don't be ridiculous. She was an old woman. 

JERRY

You don't think that I killed her? 

MORTY

You know what the flight back'll cost us? 

JERRY

It was just an innocent comment! I didn't know she had a pony! 

MORTY

Maybe we can get an army transport flight. They got a base in Sarasota, I think. 

JERRY

The whole thing was taking out of context. It was a joke. (The phone rings.) That's probably Uncle Leo. 

HELEN

Hello?... Yes, I know... Well, it's just one of those things... Sure, sure, we'll see you then. 

HELEN

The funeral's Wednesday. 

JERRY

Wednesday? What, what Wednesday? 

HELEN

Two o' clock, Wednesday. 

JERRY

Ah 

HELEN

What? 

JERRY

I've got the softball game on Wednesday. It's the championship. 

HELEN

So? You're not obligated. Go play in your game. 

JERRY

I didn't even know the woman. 

HELEN

So don't go. 

JERRY

I mean I met her three times. I don't even know her last name. 

HELEN

Jerry, no one's forcing you. 

JERRY

I mean, who has a funeral on a Wednesday? That's what I want to know. I mean, it's the championship, I'm hitting everything. 

HELEN

I don't have a dress to wear. (to Morty) And you. You don't have anything. 

MORTY

I got my sport jacket. 

HELEN

You're not wearing that to a funeral. 

MORTY

What's wrong with it? 

HELEN

It looks ridiculous. 

MORTY

What? I'm gonna buy a new sport jacket now? 

JERRY

I don't know what to do. 

MORTY

(depressed) You know what this funeral's gonna wind up costing me? Oh boy! 

JERRY

We don't understand death. And the proof of this is that we give dead people a pillow. And, uh, I mean, hey, you know. I think if you can't stretch out and get some solid rest at that point, I don't see how bedding accessories really make the difference. I mean, they got the guy in a suit with a pillow. Now, is he going to a meeting, or is he catching forty winks? I mean, let's make up our mind where we think they're going. 

ELAINE

I actually like ponies. I was just trying to make conversation. What time's your game? 

JERRY

Two Forty-Five. 

ELAINE

And what time's the funeral? 

JERRY

Two o' clock. 

ELAINE

How long does a funeral take? 

JERRY

Depends on how nice the person was. But you gotta figure, even Oswald took forty-five minutes. 

ELAINE

So you can't do both? 

JERRY

You know, if the situation were reversed and Manya had some mah-jongg championship or something, I wouldn't expect her to go to my funeral. I would understand. 

ELAINE

How can you even consider not going? 

GEORGE

You know, I've been thinking. I cannot envision any circumstances in which I'll ever have the opportunity to have sex again. How's it gonna happen? I just don't see how it could occur. 

ELAINE

You know, funerals always make me think about my own mortality and how I'm actually gonna die someday. Me, dead. Imagine that. 

GEORGE

They always make me take stock of my life. And how I've pretty much wasted all of it, and how I plan to continue wasting it. 

JERRY

I know, and then you say to yourself, 'From this moment on, I'm not gonna waste any more of it.' But then you go, 'How? What can I do that's not wasting it?' 

ELAINE

Is this a waste of time? What should we be doing? Can't you have coffee with people? 

GEORGE

You know, I can't believe you're even considering not playing. We need you. You're hitting everything. 

ELAINE

He has to go. He may have killed her. 

JERRY

Me? What about you? You brought up the pony. 

ELAINE

Oh, yeah, but I didn't say I hated anyone who had one. 

GEORGE

(to Jerry) Who's going to play left field? 

JERRY

Bender. 

GEORGE

Bender? He can't play left. He stinks. I just don't see what purpose is it gonna serve your going? I mean, you think dead peole care who's at their funeral? They don't even know they're having a funeral. It's not like she's hanging out in the back going, 'I can't believe Jerry didn't show up.' 

ELAINE

Maybe she's there in spirit. How about that? 

GEORGE

If you're a spirit, and you can travel to other dimensions and galaxies, and find out the mysteries of the universe, you think she's gonna wanna hang around Drexler's funeral home on Ocean Parkway? 

ELAINE

George, I met this woman. She is not traveling to any other dimensions. 

GEORGE

You know how easy it is for dead people to travel? It's not like getting on a bus. One second. (snaps his fingers) It's all mental. 

JERRY

Fifty years they were married. Now he's moving to Pheonix. 

ELAINE

Phoenix? What's happening with his appartment? 

JERRY

I don't know. They've been in there since, like, World War II. The rent's three hundred a month. 

ELAINE

Three hundred a month? Oh, my God. 

EULOGIST

Although this may seem like a sad event, it should not be a day of mourning. For Manya had a rich, fulfilling life. She grew up in a different world ' a simpler world ' with loving parents, a beautiful home in the country, and from what I understand, she eve had a pony. (Jerry throws up his hands.) Oh, how she loved that pony. Even in her declining years, whenever she would speak of it, her eyes would light up. It's lustrous coat, it's flowing mane. It was the pride of Krakow. 

JERRY

Well, the game's starting just about now. 

HELEN

It was good that the two of you came. It was a nice gesture. 

NEPHEW

I'm not a doctor yet, Uncle Morty. I'm just an intern. I can't write a note to an airline. 

MORTY

You've got your degree. They don't care. They just want to see something. 

JERRY

I just wanted to say how sorry I was... 

LEO

Jerry, you wanna hear something? Your cousin, Jeffrey, is switching parks. They're transferring him to Riverside - so he'll completely revamp that operation, you understand? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

LEO

He'll do in Riverside what he did in Central Park. More money. So, that's your cousin. 

MORTY

You don't understand, I've never paid a full fare. 

JERRY

Once again, I just want to say how sorry I am about the other night. 

ELAINE

Oh, me too. 

ISAAC

Oh, no no no. She forgot all about that. She was much more upset about the potato salad. 

ELAINE

So, I understand you're moving to Phoenix? 

ISAAC

Yeah, my brother lives there. I think Manya would've liked Phoenix. 

ELAINE

Mmm, gorgeous, exquisite town. So, what's happening with your apartment? 

ISAAC

Of course it's very hot there. I'll have to get uh air conditioner. 

ELAINE

Oh, you can have mine. I'll ship it out to you. (Isaac isn't listening to Elaine) But what about that big apartment on West End Avenue? 

ISAAC

Although they say it's a dry heat. 

ELAINE

Dry, wet... (trying to get through to him) what's happening with your apartment? 

ISAAC

I don't even know if I should take my winter clothing. 

ELAINE

I have an idea. Leave the winter clothing in the apartment, and I'll watch it for you and I'll live there and I'll make sure that nothing happens to it. 

ISAAC

Oh, the apartment. Jeffrey's taking the apartment. 

ELAINE

Oh, Jeffrey. 

JERRY

You know Jeffery? 

HELEN

It's raining. 

JERRY

It's raining? It's raining. The game will be postponed. We'll play tomorrow. 

MORTY

Believe me, I wouldn't bother you if the army hadn't closed that base in Sarasota. Here, scribble a little something here. 

NEPHEW

I can't. I'll get in trouble. 

MORTY

Oh, for God's sake! 

GEORGE

Who gets picked off in softball? It's unheard of. 

JERRY

It's never happened to me before. 

ELAINE

I remember saying to myself, 'Why is Jerry so far off the base?' 

JERRY

I'll have to live with this shame for the rest of my life. 

GEORGE

And then in the fifth inning, why did you take off on the pop fly? 

JERRY

I thought there were two outs. 

ELAINE

I couldn't believe it when I saw you running. (laughing) I thought maybe they had changed the rules or something. 

GEORGE

(smiling) What about Sharon Besser? 

JERRY

Oh, well, of course. Nineteen-seventy-three. 

ELAINE

Makes you wonder, though, doesn't it? 

JERRY

Wonder about what? 

ELAINE

You know... (looking up) the spirit world. 

JERRY

You think Manya showed up during the game and put a hex on me? 

ELAINE

I never saw anyone play like that. 

JERRY

But I went to the funeral. 

ELAINE

Yeah, but that doesn't make up for killin' her. 

GEORGE

Maybe Manya missed the funeral because she was off visiting another galaxy that day. 

JERRY

Don't you think she woulda heard I was there? 

GEORGE

Not necessarily. 

JERRY

Who figures and immigrant's gonna have a pony? 

JERRY

What is the pony? What is the point of the pony? Why do we have these animals, these ponies? What do we do with them? Besides the pony ride. Why ponies? What are we doing with them? I mean, police don't use them for, you know, crowd control. (Jerry crouches down, and makes like he's riding a pony.) 'Hey, uh, you wanna get back behind the barricades. Hey! Hey, little boy. Yeah, I'm talking to you. Behind the barricades!' So somebody, I assume, genetically engineered these ponies. Do you think they could make them any size? I mean, could they make them like the size of a quarter, if they wanted? That would be fun for Monopoly, though, wouldn't it? Just have a little pony and you put him on the... 'Baltic, that's two down, go ahead. Hold it. Right there. Baltic. Yeah, that's it. Fine. Right there, hold it right there.' 

SALESMAN

Well, I might have something in the back. 

ELAINE

The back? They never find anything in the back. If they had anything good in the back, they'd put it out in the front. 

JERRY

Why don't they open up an entire store for the back? Call it, 'Just Back.' All back; No front. You walk in the front, you're immediately in the back. (Jerry picks up a tie display, and shakes it rhythmically from left to right.) Look, Elaine, tie carwash. 

CUSTOMER

Oh, I just read that. That's terrific. 

JERRY

(pointing to Elaine) Her father wrote that. 

CUSTOMER

Alton Benes is your father? 

ELAINE

Yeah. 

CUSTOMER

I always felt he deserved a wider audience. 

ELAINE

I'm not so sure he wants one. 

ELAINE

Hey, don't forget Sunday, okay? You and George are coming, right? Hotel Westbury, eight o'clock. 

JERRY

I guess I'm coming. I mean... 

ELAINE

What? What, you don't want to go now? 

JERRY

No, I'll go. I'm going. 

ELAINE

No, Jerry, you have to. I need a buffer. You know, I haven't seen my father in a while and... you know... 

JERRY

I'm worried I won't be able to talk to him. He's such a great writer. Frankly, I prefer the company of nitwits. 

ELAINE

So, that's why we're not together anymore. 

JERRY

What is this? 

JERRY

This is beautiful. These jackets never fit me right. 

ELAINE

Try it on. 

ELAINE

Wow, this is soft suede. 

JERRY

This may be the most perfect jacket I have ever put on. 

JERRY

How much is it? 

ELAINE

(shocked) Oh my God. 

JERRY

Bad? (Elaine nods.) Very bad? 

ELAINE

You have no idea. 

JERRY

I have some idea. 

ELAINE

No idea. 

JERRY

I've got a ballpark. 

ELAINE

There is no park and the team has relocated. 

JERRY

Let me see that. (Jerry looks at the tag.) That is high. 

ELAINE

Oh man, that is a beautiful jacket, though. 

JERRY

What's with the pink lining and the candy stripes? 

ELAINE

Well, it's just a lining. You can always have it changed. 

JERRY

Should I get it? I hate these moments. I'm hearing the dual voices now, you know, 'What about the money?' 'What's money?' 

SALESMAN

It looks wonderful on you. 

JERRY

Hey. 

KRAMER

Hey. New jacket? 

JERRY

What do you think? 

KRAMER

It's beautiful. 

JERRY

Is it me? 

KRAMER

That's definitely you. 

JERRY

Really? 

KRAMER

That's more you than you've ever been. Hey, what is with the pink lining? 

JERRY

I don't know. It's got a pink lining. 

KRAMER

Oh... So, what did you pay for this? 

KRAMER

How much? 

JERRY

What's the difference? 

KRAMER

What, you're not gonna tell me? 

JERRY

I'd rather not say it out loud. It's embarrassing. 

KRAMER

Over three hundred? 

JERRY

Yes, but let's just stop it right there. 

KRAMER

It's over four hundred? 

KRAMER

Is it over four hundred? 

JERRY

Would you? 

KRAMER

Woah, Nelson! 

JERRY

I know, I know. 

KRAMER

What are you gonna do with the leather one? 

JERRY

I don't know. 

KRAMER

Well, are you gonna wear it? 

JERRY

Maybe. 

KRAMER

You're not going to wear this. 

JERRY

Do you want it? 

KRAMER

Well, yeah. Okay. I'll take it. I like the jacket. 

JERRY

Okay, take it. 

KRAMER

Heey, good karma for you. (Kramer puts on Jerry's old jacket and stands next to Jerry, looking in the mirror.) Oh baby. 

GEORGE

(singing) 'Master of the house/Doling out the charm/Ready with a handshake and an open palm/Tells a saucy talk/Loves to make a stir/Everyone appreciates a...' 

JERRY

What is that song? 

GEORGE

Oh, it's from Les Miserables. I went to see it last week. I can't get it out of my head. I just keep singing it over and over. It just comes out. I have no control over it. I'm singin' it on elevators, buses. I'm singin' it in front of clients. It's taken over my life. 

JERRY

You know, Schumann went mad from that. 

GEORGE

Artie Schuman? From Camp Hatchapee? 

JERRY

No, you idiot. 

GEORGE

What are you, Bud Abbott? What are you callin' me an idiot? 

JERRY

You don't know Robert Schumann? The composer? 

GEORGE

Oh, Schumann. Of course. 

JERRY

He went crazy from one note. He couldn't get it out of his head. I think it was an A. He kept repeating it over and over again. He had to be institutionalized. 

GEORGE

Really? (Jerry nods his head) Well, what if it doesn't stop? Oh, that I really needed to hear. That helps a lot! All right, just say something. Just start talking. Change the subject. Let's just go, All right? I can't believe we're having dinner with Alton Benes. 

JERRY

I know exactly what's gonna happen tonight. I'm gonna try and act like I'm not impressed, he's gonna see right through it. 

GEORGE

Yeah, he'll be looking at us like he's backstage at a puppet show. 

JERRY

Let me just get my jacket. 

GEORGE

(singing) : 'Master of the house/Keeper of the inn...' (Jerry re-enters the living room and modestly models his new jacket for George. George is impressed.) This is huge! When did this happen? 

JERRY

Wednesday. This jacket has completely changed my life. When I leave the house in this, it's with a whole different confidence. Like tonight, I might've been a little nervous. But, inside this jacket, I am composed, grounded, secure that I can meet any social challenge. 

GEORGE

Can I say one thing to you? And I say this with an unblemished record of staunch heterosexuality. 

JERRY

Absolutely. 

GEORGE

It's fabulous. 

JERRY

I know. 

GEORGE

And I'll tell you something else, I'm not even going to ask you. I want to know. But I'm not gonna ask. You'll tell me when you feel comfortable. So what was it? Four hundred? Five hundred? Did you pay five hundred for this? (Jerry coyly ignores George's questions, while George grows increasingly serious.) Over six? Can't be seven. Don't tell me you paid seven hundred dollars for this jacket! Did you pay seven hundred dollars for this jacket? Is that what you're saying to me? You are sick! Is that what you paid for this jacket? Over seven hundred? What did you pay for this jacket?! I won't say anything. I wanna know what you paid for this jacket! Oh my God! A thousand dollars?! You paid a thousand dollars for this jacket?! All right, fine. (George heads for the door.) I'm walking outta here right now thinking you paid a thousand dollars for this jacket, unless you tell me different. (Jerry remains silent.) Oh, ho! All right! I'll tell you what, if you don't say anything in the next five seconds, I'll know it was over a thousand. 

KRAMER

(to Jerry) Hey. Hey, would you do me a solid? 

JERRY

Well, what kind of solid? 

KRAMER

I need you to sit in the car for two minutes while it's double-parked. I gotta pick up some birds. 

JERRY

Birds? 

KRAMER

Yeah. A friend of mine, he's a magician. He's going away on vacation. He asked me to take care of his doves. 

JERRY

So take a cab. 

KRAMER

They won't take a cage full of birds. 

JERRY

I can't. I'm on my way out. There's no way I can do it. 

KRAMER

George, do me a solid? Two minutes. 

GEORGE

Well, I'm going with him. I'd like to... I've never done a 'solid' before. 

KRAMER

All right... Yeah. All right, have a good one. 

JERRY

(scoffs) Two minutes. Believe me, I know his two minutes. By his conception of time, his life will last over two thousand years. 

GEORGE

(singing) 'Master of the House/Quick to catch your eye/Never wants a passerby to pass him by...' 

JERRY

Schumann. (George stops himself, frightened. Jerry looks around the lobby.) Where are they? 

GEORGE

Maybe he didn't show up. 

JERRY

What, you don't want to do this? 

GEORGE

I don't think there's ever been an appointment in my life where I wanted the other guy to show up. (George notices an elderly man in a leather chair.) Wait a second, is that him? 

JERRY

Yeah, I think it is. (They walk toward the man. Jerry hesitates.) Where's Elaine? 

GEORGE

I'm nervous. 

JERRY

(to the man) Excuse me. Mister Benes? 

ALTON

Yeah? 

JERRY

I'm Jerry, Elaine's friend, and this is George. 

GEORGE

It's a great thrill to meet you, Sir. 

ALTON

Sit down. Want a drink? 

JERRY

Sure. 

ALTON

What'll you have? 

JERRY

(to waiter) I'll have a cranberry juice with two limes. 

GEORGE

And, I'll have a club soda with no ice. 

BENES

I'll have another Scotch with plenty of ice. 

GEORGE

You like ice? 

ALTON

Huh? 

GEORGE

I said, do you like ice? 

ALTON

Like it? 

GEORGE

Don't you think you get more without it? 

ALTON

Where's Elaine? 

JERRY

Well, we thought she was meeting you earlier. She's usually pretty punctual. Don't you find that, George? 

GEORGE

Yeah, yeah. She's punctual... and uh she's been late, sometimes. 

JERRY

Yeah, yeah. Sometimes she's on time, and... sometimes she's late. 

GEORGE

I guess... (chuckles) today she's late. 

JERRY

It appears that way. 

GEORGE

Yup. 

JERRY

Yup. 

ALTON

Looks like rain. 

GEORGE

I know, I know, that's what they said. 

ALTON

Who said? 

GEORGE

The weather guy, Dr. Waldo. 

ALTON

I don't need anybody to tell me it's gonna rain. 

GEORGE

No, of course not. I didn't- 

ALTON

All I have to do is stick my head out the window. (The waiter returns with the drinks, and distributes them to the men.) Which one's suppose to be the funny guy? 

GEORGE

(pointing at Jerry) Oh, he's the comedian. 

JERRY

I'm just a regular person. 

GEORGE

No, no. He's just being modest. 

ALTON

We had a funny guy with us in Korea. Tailgunner. They blew his brains out all over the Pacific. There's nothing funny about that. 

JERRY

Would you excuse me a minute? I'm gonna go to the bathroom. I'll be right back. 

GEORGE

I just wanted to tell you that I really enjoyed Fair Game. I thought it was just brilliant. 

ALTON

Drivel. 

GEORGE

Yea, well, maybe some parts. 

ALTON

(defensive) What parts? 

GEORGE

The... drivel... parts. Oh my gosh, I just realized ' I have to make a phone call. I-I can't believe- Would you- 

GEORGE

Thank you for leaving me alone with him! 

JERRY

That was brutal. I can't go back out there. 

GEORGE

Well, let's just leave. 

JERRY

Elaine'll kill me. 

GEORGE

Where is she? 

JERRY

She's gotta be here soon. 

GEORGE

How could she leave us alone with this lunatic? Ten more minutes, and that's it! I'm leaving. I have to tell you, this guy scares me. 

JERRY

The waiter was trembling! 

GEORGE

If she doesn't show up, we can't possibly have dinner with him alone. 

JERRY

How are we gonna get out of it? 

GEORGE

We'll say we're frightened and we have to go home. 

JERRY

Yeah, that's good. He'd clunk our heads together like Moe. 

GEORGE

I don't know. Just start scratching. Tell him you have the crabs. He was in the military. He'll understand that. 

JERRY

All fathers are intimidating. They're intimidating because they are fathers. Once a man has children, for the rest of his life, his attitude is, 'To hell with the world, I can make my own people. I'll eat whatever I want, I'll wear whatever I want, and I'll create whoever I want.' 

ALTON

(to George) Who'd you call? 

GEORGE

(improvising) My uh uncle is having an operation. I just wanted to see how he was. 

ALTON

What kind of operation? 

GEORGE

Bone marrow. 

MANAGER

Mister Benes? 

ALTON

Yes? 

MANAGER

A message for you. 

ALTON

From Elaine. She got tied up. She'll be here in thirty minutes. 

ALTON

Yeah, they should've taken care of Castro when they had the chance. Like we did in Guatamala in 'fifty-three. 

JERRY

Well, Guatamala... 

GEORGE

Sure, Guatamala... 

ALTON

All right, you boys get yourselves together. We'll head up to the restaurant. I'll leave a note for Elaine. I'm going to the bathroom. 

GEORGE

Come on, let's go! 

JERRY

What about Elaine? 

GEORGE

To hell with Elaine! 

JERRY

She'll be furious. 

GEORGE

We're dying here! 

JERRY

That's her! She's here! 

ELAINE

I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Where is Dad? 

GEORGE

(contemptuously, imitating Alton's voice) He's in the bathroom. 

JERRY

(to Elaine) Where have you been?! 

ELAINE

Kramer! That... Kramer! I'm just about to leave, he calls me up. He begs me to sit in his car for two minutes, so he can pick up these birds... 

JERRY

Oh, you didn't... 

ELAINE

Well, he said he'd drive me here right after. So, I am sitting in his car twenty minutes! He doesn't come down. I am freezing. Then a cop comes by, tells me to get out of the car. He's a city marshal. He's towing the car away. Kramer owes thousands of dollars in back tickets. He was going to tow it with me in the car! So, they tow the car. Now, I am standing outside, and I am freezing, but I cannot leave because I have to tell him what happened to the car. So, finally, he finally comes down with his giant cage filled with doves. He said he was getting special instructions, that each dove has a different diet... So, we're wandering around trying to get a cab, when two of these doves fly out! Now we're running down the street after these doves; I almost got hit by a bus! (Elaine sits in Alton's chair and takes a deep breath.) So how's everything going over here? 

JERRY

Great. 

GEORGE

Couldn't be better. 

ELAINE

Good. 'Cause Dad can make some people a little uncomfortable. 

JERRY

Oh, no, no. 

GEORGE

Get outta here.. 

ELAINE

Man, Kramer! I could kill him! 

JERRY

I can't believe it. You know better than to get involved with Kramer. 

JERRY

Ah, the lift. Like the lure of the siren's song. Never what it seems to be, yet who among us can resist? 

GEORGE

Where do you come up with this stuff? 

ALTON

Well, look who's here. 

ELAINE

Oh, hi, Dad. 

ALTON

Hello, dear. 

ALTON

Who's the lipstick for? 

ELAINE

No one. 

ALTON

How's your mother? 

ELAINE

Fine. 

ALTON

How about you? Are you working? 

ELAINE

Yeah, I'm reading manuscripts for Pendant Publishing. I told you ten times. 

ALTON

Pendant! Those bastards. Well all right, boys. We'll go to that Pakistani restaurant on 46th Street. You're not afraid of a little spice, are you? 

GEORGE

(singing) 'Master of the house/Doling out the charm/Ready with a handshake and an open...' 

ALTON

Pipe down, chorus boy. 

ELAINE

Ohh... it's snowing. It's beautiful. 

JERRY

(to George) Snow. Snow, that can't be good for suede, can it? 

GEORGE

I wouldn't think so. 

JERRY

What should I do? (to Alton) Uh, we're taking a cab, aren't we? 

ALTON

Cab? It's only five blocks. 

GEORGE

(to Jerry) Why don't you just turn it inside out? 

JERRY

Inside out! Great. 

ALTON

Wait a minute. What the hell do you call this? 

JERRY

Oh, I turned my jacket inside out. 

ALTON

Well, you look like a damn fool! 

JERRY

Well, it's a new suede jacket. It might get ruined. 

ALTON

Well, you're not going to walk down the street with me and my daughter dressed like that. That's for damn sure. 

GEORGE

It's uh, it's only a few blocks. 

JERRY

(to the intercom) Elaine? 

ELAINE

Yeah. 

JERRY

Come on up. 

KRAMER

Hey. 

JERRY

Hey. 

KRAMER

I've gotta feed the birds. 

JERRY

So? 

KRAMER

You got any of those mini Ritzes? 

JERRY

I can't believe I do. 

KRAMER

Yeah! Well, are you going out? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

KRAMER

Hey, where's your new jacket? (Jerry points to the jacket hanging in the bathroom. It's ruined.) What? (Kramer enters the bathroom, and sees the garment.) Ohhh. What did you do to it? 

JERRY

I was out in the snow last night. 

KRAMER

Don't you know what that does to suede? 

JERRY

I have an idea. (Elaine enters; to Elaine) We can make the nine-thirty at Cinema Three. 

ELAINE

Okay. (to Kramer) Hello. (to Jerry) Listen, thanks again for coming last night. Dad said he had a great time. 

JERRY

Is he still in town? 

ELAINE

No, he's driving back to Maryland tonight. 

KRAMER

So, uh... what are you gonna do with that one now? 

JERRY

I don't know. 

KRAMER

(smiling) Well... 

ELAINE

(to Jerry) I didn't want to tell you this, but usually he hates everyone. 

JERRY

Really? 

KRAMER

You gonna throw this out? 

JERRY

Well, I can't wear it. 

ELAINE

Yeah, he like you though. Said you reminded him of somebody he knew in Korea. 

KRAMER

(to Jerry) Well, if you're just gonna throw it out, you know, I could take it. 

JERRY

Yeah, go ahead, take it. 

ELAINE

Dad thinks George is gay. 

JERRY

Oh, because of all the singing? 

ELAINE

No, he pretty much thinks everyone is gay. 

KRAMER

Hey, see, I like it like this. 

ELAINE

Isn't that...? (Jerry nods.) Oh, is this from the snow last night? (Jerry nods.) Ugh... you know what you should've done? You should've turned it inside out. 

JERRY

I'll try and remember that. 

KRAMER

Boy, it's too bad you gave me this one too. 

JERRY

Yeah, too bad. 

KRAMER

I'm gonna have to do something about this lining. 

ALTON

(singing) 'Master of the house/Doling out the charm/Ready with a handshake and an open palm...' 

JERRY

I had a leather jacket that got ruined. Now, why does moisture ruin leather? I don't get this. Aren't cows outside most of the time? I don't understand it. When it's raining do cows go up to the farmhouse, 'Let us in, we're all wearin' leather. Open the door! We're gonna ruin the whole outfit here!' 'Is it suede?' 'I am suede, the whole thing is suede, I can't have this cleaned. It's all I got!'&nbsp; 

GEORGE

(excited) So then, as we were leaving, we were just kind of standing there, and she was sort of smiling at me, and I wasn't sure if she wanted me to ask her out, because when women smile at me I don't know what it means. Sometimes I interpret it like they're psychotic or something and I don't know if I'm supposed to smile back, I don't know what to do. So I just stood there like ' remember how Quayle looked when Benson gave him that Kennedy line? That's what I looked like. 

JERRY

So you didn't ask? 

GEORGE

No, I froze. 

JERRY

Counter. 

GEORGE

Oh yeah. So wait, wait. A half-hour later I'm back in the office, I tell Lloyd the whole story. He says, 'So why don't you call her?' I says, 'I can't.' I couldn't, I couldn't do it right then. For me to ask a woman out I gotta get into a mental state like the karate guys before they break the bricks. So Lloyd calls me a wuss. 

JERRY

He said wuss? 

GEORGE

Yeah. Anyway, he shamed me into it. 

JERRY

So you called. 

GEORGE

Right. And, and to cover my nervousness I started eating an apple, because I think if they hear you chewing on the other end of the phone, it makes you sound casual. 

JERRY

Yeah. Like a farm boy. 

GEORGE

Right. So I call her up, I tell her it's me, she gives me an enthusiastic 'Hi!' 

JERRY

Wow. The enthusiastic hi. That's beautiful. 

GEORGE

Oh, I don't get the enthusiastic hi, I'm outta there. 

JERRY

All right, so you're chewing your apple, you got your enthusiastic hi... Go ahead. 

GEORGE

So, we're talking, and I don't like to go too long before I ask them out, I wanna get it over with right away, so I just blurt out, 'What are you doing Saturday night?' 

JERRY

And? 

GEORGE

She bought. 

JERRY

Great day in the morning. 

GEORGE

Then I got off the phone right away. 

JERRY

Sure, it's like robbing a bank. You don't loiter around in front of the teller holding that big bag of money. You come in, you hit and get out. 

GEORGE

It's amazing. We, we both have dates on the same night. I can't remember the last time that happened. 

GEORGE

I can't stand doing laundry. That's why I have forty pairs of underwear. 

CAROL

You do not. 

GEORGE

Absolutely. Because instead of doing a wash, I just keep buying underwear. My goal is to have over three hundred and sixty pair. That way, I only have to do wash once a year. 

JERRY

(in an attempted Scottish accent) Come on, try it. Let me hear you try a Scottish accent. 

DONNA

That's Irish. 

JERRY

Irish, Scottish, what's the difference, lassie? 

CAROL

So, uh, thanks for dinner. It was great. 

GEORGE

Yeah. (clears his throat) We should do this again. 

CAROL

Would you like to come upstairs for some coffee? 

GEORGE

Oh, no, thanks. I can't drink coffee late at night, it keeps me up. 

CAROL

(confused by his response) So, um, okay. 

GEORGE

Okay. 

CAROL

Goodnight. 

GEORGE

Yeah, take it easy. 

DONNA

Thanks again for the movie. 

JERRY

You're welcome. 

DONNA

I'd invite you up, but the place is being painted. 

JERRY

Oh, that's okay. 

DONNA

Unless you want to go to your place. 

JERRY

Okay... but there's no cake or anything, if that's what you're looking for. 

GEORGE

(frustrated) Take it easy! Huh! Take it easy! 

JERRY

I think if one's going to kill oneself, the least you could do is leave a note. It's common courtesy. I don't know. That's just the way I was brought up. 

DONNA

Values are very important. 

JERRY

Oh, so important. So what are you doing uh Thursday night? You wanna have dinner? 

DONNA

Thursday's great. 

JERRY

Tan pants. Why do I buy tan pants, Donna? I don't feel comfortable in them. 

DONNA

Are those Cotton Dockers? 

JERRY

Oh, I can't begin to tell you how much I hate that commercial. 

DONNA

Really? I like that commercial. 

JERRY

You like that commercial? 

DONNA

Yeah, it's clever. 

JERRY

Now wait a second, you mean the one where the guys are all standing around, supposedly being very casual and witty? 

DONNA

Yeah, that's the one. 

JERRY

What could you possibly like about that? 

DONNA

I don't know. I like the, guys. 

JERRY

Yeah, they're so funny and so comfortable with each other, and I could be comfortable too, if I had pants like that. I could sit on a porch and wrestle around, and maybe even be part of a real bull session. 

JERRY

Even if the dialogue did ring true. (Donna starts to get annoyed that Jerry won't let the conversation go) Even if somehow somewhere men actually talk like that, what does that have to do with the pants? Doesn't that bother you? 

DONNA

(annoyed) That's the idea. That's what's clever about it, that they're not talking about the pants. 

JERRY

But they're talking about nothing. 

DONNA

That's the point. 

JERRY

I know the point. 

DONNA

No one is telling you to like it. 

JERRY

I mean, all those quick shots of the pants. Just pants, pants, pants, pants, pants, pants, pants. What is that supposed to be? 

JERRY

What's brutal about the date is the scrutiny that you put each other through. Because whenever you think about this person in terms of the future, you have to magnify everything about them. You know, like the guy'll be like, 'I don't think her eyebrows are even. Could I look at uneven eyebrows for the rest of my life?' And of course the woman's looking at the guy, thinking, 'What is he looking at? Do I want somebody looking at me like this for the rest of my life?' 

JERRY

I'm supposed to see her again on Thursday, but can I go out with someone who actually likes this commercial? 

ELAINE

I once broke up with a guy because he didn't keep his bathroom clean enough. 

JERRY

No kidding. Did you tell him that was the reason? 

ELAINE

Oh yeah, I told him all the time. You would not have believed his tub. Germs were building a town in there ' they were constructing offices. Houses near the drain were going for a hundred and fifty thousand dollars. 

ELAINE

Hi. 

JERRY

You're still thinking about this? 

GEORGE

She invites me up at twelve o'clock at night, for coffee, and I don't go up. 'No thank you. I don't want coffee. It keeps me up. Too late for me to drink coffee.' I said this to her. People this stupid shouldn't be allowed to live. I can't imagine what she must think of me. 

JERRY

She thinks you're a guy that doesn't like coffee. 

GEORGE

She invited me up. Coffee's not coffee, coffee is sex. 

ELAINE

Maybe coffee was coffee. 

GEORGE

Coffee's coffee in the morning. It's not coffee at twelve o'clock at night. 

ELAINE

Well some people drink coffee that late. 

GEORGE

Yeah, people who work at NORAD, who're on twenty-four hour missile watch. Everything was going along so great. She was laughing, I was funny... I kept saying to myself, 'Keep it up, don't blow it, you're doing great.' 

ELAINE

It's all in your head. All she knows is she had a good time. I think you should call her. 

GEORGE

I can't call her now. It's too soon. I'm planning a Wednesday call. 

ELAINE

Oh, why? I love it when guys call me the next day. 

GEORGE

Of course you do, but you're imagining a guy you like, not a guy who goes, 'Oh no, I don't drink coffee late at night.' If I call her now, she's gonna think I'm too needy. Women don't wanna see need. They want a take-charge guy ' a colonel, a Kaiser, a tsar. 

ELAINE

All she'll think is that you like her. 

GEORGE

That's exactly what I'm trying to avoid! 

ELAINE

Well, she wants you to like her. 

GEORGE

Yes, she wants me to like her, if she likes me. But she doesn't like me! 

ELAINE

I don't know what your parents did to you. 

KRAMER

Hey, I just thought of a really funny thing for your act. All right, you're up there, you're on the stage and you go, 'Hey, you ever notice how cars here in New York, they never get out of the way of ambulances anymore. Someone's in a life-and-death situation, and we're thinking, 'Well, sorry buddy, you should've thought of that when you were eating cheese omelettes and sauages for breakfast every morning for the last thirty years.' 

KRAMER

So you gonna use it? 

KRAMER

It's funny. 

ELAINE

It is funny. 

JERRY

I like to use my own material. 

KRAMER

That's as good as anything you do. 

GEORGE

All right, I gotta make a call. Everybody out, come on. 

JERRY

Why do we have to leave? 

GEORGE

Because I can't call a woman with other people in the room. Come on, let's go. 

ELAINE

Oh, see, this is the problem. 

JERRY

You're kicking me out of my house? 

GEORGE

Yes. 

ELAINE

(encouraging) Don't forget. 

GEORGE

(to Elaine) Right, alright. (to Jerry) Oh Jerry, do you have any apples? 

JERRY

Don't do the apples. It's enough already with the apples. 

CAROL

(from the phone; a recorded message) Hi, it's Carol, I'll get back to you. 

GEORGE

Um, hi, it's George, George Costanza, remember me? The guy that didn't come up for coffee. You see, I didn't realise that coffee didn't really mean... well, whatever. Anyway, it was fun. It was... it was fun, so... oh boy, um, so... You call me back. If you want. It's up to you, you know, whatever you wanna do. Either way. The ball's in your court. So uh, take it easy. 

JERRY

I'm just gonna get my jacket, I'll meet you downstairs. What's the matter, did you call? 

GEORGE

Got her machine. I'm dead, I'm a dead man. That's it. I'm dead, I'm a dead man. Dead man. 

JERRY

What did you say? 

GEORGE

I don't know what the hell I said. I gave her an ultimatum and there's nothing I can do. It's a machine. The little light is blinking right now, 'Come and listen to the idiot. Hey everybody, the idiot's on!' 

JERRY

After one date you try and improvise on her machine? 

GEORGE

Now I'm in the worst position of all. 

ELAINE

Y'know, my brother-in-law once left a message on this guy's machine, and he blurted out some business information he wasn't supposed to, and it would have cost him fifteen thousand dollars, so he waited outside the guy's house and when the guy came home he went upstairs with him and he switched the tape. 

GEORGE

He did that? 

ELAINE

Yeah. 

GEORGE

Somebody did that? 

JERRY

She'll call you back. You're overreacting. 

JERRY

Not once. 

DONNA

Never? 

JERRY

I have never seen one episode of I Love Lucy in my life, ever. 

DONNA

That's amazing. 

JERRY

Thank you. 

DONNA

Is there anything else about you I should know? 

JERRY

Yes, I'm lactose intolerant. 

DONNA

Really? 

JERRY

I have no patience for lactose. And I won't stand for it. Um, I'll be right back. 

GEORGE

Wait till you hear this! (George sees Donna and no Jerry.) Whoa, ah, I'm sorry, I didn't, I had no idea. 

DONNA

Wait, wait. He's in the bathroom. 

GEORGE

I just wanted to talk to him for a minute, but I'll come back. 

DONNA

You don't have to leave. 

GEORGE

You sure? 

DONNA

Yes. 

GEORGE

Okay. 

DONNA

I'm Donna. 

GEORGE

Donna. Oh, you're the one that likes that commercial! 

DONNA

He told you about that? 

GEORGE

(back-pedalling) No, he, he didn't actually tell me that, uh, we were talking about that commercial ' in fact I think I brought it up because I like that commercial. No, he, he would never tell me anything. He never discusses anything. He's, he's like a clam. You're not gonna mention this, to him... 

DONNA

(to Jerry) So you go around telling your friends I'm not hip because I like that commercial. 

JERRY

What? (to George) What did, what did you say? 

GEORGE

Say? What? Nothing, I... 

DONNA

You told him how I like the commercial. 

JERRY

Well, so what if I said that? 

DONNA

Well, so, you didn't have to tell your friends. 

JERRY

No, I had to tell my friends ' my friends didn't have to tell you. 

GEORGE

(to Donna) Why did you have to get me in trouble? 

DONNA

I don't like you talking about me with your friends behind my back. 

GEORGE

Boy oh boy. 

JERRY

I said I couldn't believe you liked that commercial. So what? 

DONNA

I asked some friends of mine this week, and all of them liked the commercial. 

JERRY

Boy, I bet you got a regular Algonquin round table there. 

KRAMER

Hey. 

JERRY

Oh uh, Kramer, this is Donna. 

KRAMER

Oh. Cotton Dockers! 

GEORGE

Hello! All right, we should be going. Come on... 

KRAMER

What? Where are we going? 

GEORGE

Come on! 

DONNA

Don't bother, I'm leaving. 

JERRY

Donna, really, you're making too much of this. 

KRAMER

'One hundred percent Cotton Dockers. If they're not Dockers, they're just pants' 

JERRY

Please, Donna... 

DONNA

I don't wanna hear it. 

GEORGE

I can't believe I said that. You know me, I'm a vault. 

JERRY

Don't worry about it, it wasn't working anyway. 

KRAMER

What happened there? 

JERRY

I'll tell you later. 

GEORGE

You are not gonna believe what's going on with this woman. 

GEORGE

Okay, so you remember I made the initial call Sunday, she doesn't call back. I call again Monday, I leave another message. I call Tuesday, I get the machine again, 'I know you're there, I don't know what your story is.' Yesterday, I'm a volcano ' I try one more call, the machine comes on, and I let fly like Mussolini from the balcony, 'Where the hell do you get the nerve? You invite me up for coffee and then you don't call me back for four days? I don't like coffee, I don't have to come up. I'd like to get one more shot at the coffee just so I could spit it in your face.' 

JERRY

You said that? 

GEORGE

I lost it. 

JERRY

I can't blame you. I can't believe she never called you back. 

GEORGE

She did. Today. 

JERRY

What? 

GEORGE

She called my office. She said she's been in the Hamptons since Sunday. She didn't know if I was trying to get in touch with her. Her machine broke, and she's been using her old machine and she doesn't have the beeper for it. 

JERRY

So she didn't get the messages. 

GEORGE

Exactly, but they're on there ' waiting. She said she can't wait to see me, we're having dinner tonight. She's supposed to call me as soon as she gets home. 

JERRY

But what about the messages? 

JERRY

Elaine's thing? How you gonna get in? 

GEORGE

I'll meet her outside the building. 

JERRY

But you know as soon as she gets in the apartment she's going right for that machine. 

GEORGE

Unless she goes for the bathroom. That's my only chance. (George crumbles. He drops the cassette on the table.) Who am I kidding? I can't do this, I can't do this. I don't even know how to work those stupid machines. 

JERRY

There's nothing to it. You lift the lid, it comes right out. 

GEORGE

You do it for me. 

JERRY

What? 

GEORGE

Come on, it'll be so much easier. 

JERRY

How you gonna get me up there? 

GEORGE

I'll tell her I bumped into you, I'm giving you a ride uptown. 

JERRY

And who makes the switch? 

GEORGE

You do. 

JERRY

I do. 

JERRY

I can't get involved in this. 

GEORGE

I think I may be in love with this woman. 

JERRY

What if she sees me? 

GEORGE

Oh, you are such a wuss. 

JERRY

A wuss? 

GEORGE

Yeah. 

JERRY

Did you call me a wuss? 

GEORGE

Well there is traffic. It might take her till eight-fifteen. 

JERRY

I got one problem. You're keeping her busy in the other room. Now, what if she somehow gets away from you and is coming in? You have to signal me that she's coming. 

GEORGE

A signal, right, um, okay, uh, okay, the signal is, I'll call out tippy-toe! 

JERRY

Tippy Toe? I don't think so. 

GEORGE

You don't like tippy toe? 

JERRY

No tippy toe. 

GEORGE

All right, uh, okay, I got it, um, I'll sing. 

JERRY

What song? 

GEORGE

'How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria?' 

JERRY

What is that? 

GEORGE

Oh, it's a lovely song. (singing) 'How do you solve a problem like Maria?...' 

JERRY

Anything else? 

GEORGE

You pick it. 

JERRY

'Lemon Tree.' 

GEORGE

Peter, Paul and Mary. 

JERRY

No, Trini Lopez. 

GEORGE

(singing) 'Lemon tree, very pretty and a lemon flower...' 

GEORGE

Alright ok. You got the tape? 

JERRY

Standard. Micro. 

GEORGE

How do you feel? Confident? 

JERRY

Feel good. 

GEORGE

You nervous? 

JERRY

Not at all. 

GEORGE

Get up, get up, it's her! Oh, the hell with this, I'm scared to death, just walk away, it's off, cancel everything, go! 

CAROL

Hey! What are you doing here? I thought I was supposed to call you when I got home. 

GEORGE

I, I couldn't wait. I was too anxious to see you. 

CAROL

Oh, that's so sweet. 

GEORGE

Oh, this is my friend, Jerry Seinfeld. I just bumped into him around the corner. Isn't that a coincidence? The funny thing is, I see him all the time. 

JERRY

All the time. 

CAROL

It's nice to meet you. 

JERRY

Hi. 

CAROL

So, I'm starving. Where are we gonna eat? 

GEORGE

You know, we could go uptown, and that way we could give Jerry a ride home. 

CAROL

Okay. Let's go, I'm ready, where'd you park? 

GEORGE

Don't you wanna go upstairs first? 

CAROL

No, what for? I'll just give my bag to the doorman. 

JERRY

You know, I really need to use the bathroom. 

CAROL

Oh well there's a bathroom in the coffee shop just next door. 

GEORGE

Yes, yes, but uh, I have to make a call, so... 

CAROL

Well they have a phone. 

GEORGE

I know Jerry. He has this phobia about public toilets. I think we really should go upstairs. 

CAROL

(aloud) You know, I think I will go upstairs. I can check my machine. 

GEORGE

Right, right. 

CAROL

The bathroom's on the hall to the right. 

JERRY

Uh, you know, why don't you go first, you just had a long trip. 

CAROL

No, I'm fine. 

JERRY

Um, you know, it's the damnedest thing. It went away. 

CAROL

Oh, that's weird. 

GEORGE

No, no that can happen. I've, uh, I've read about that in medical journals. It's a freak thing, but... 

CAROL

Well, let me just check my messages, and we'll go. 

GEORGE

Uh, Carol, can I talk to you for a second? Right now? 

CAROL

Sure. 

GEORGE

Please, this is very, very important. 

GEORGE

(from other room) Uh, tippy toe! Tippy toe! Lemon tree! 

CAROL

(to Jerry) Now I know who you are! You're a comedian. I've seen you, it's driving me crazy. 

JERRY

Right. I am. 

GEORGE

Carol, that's so rude. Please, I'm serious, just for a moment, if you wouldn't mind. And then we'll talk to Jerry. 

JERRY

(calls) Hey you two. I'm ready to go. 

CAROL

That's what you had to tell me? Your father wears sneakers in the pool? 

GEORGE

(to Jerry) Don't you find that strange? 

JERRY

Yes. 

CAROL

Well, I'll just check my machine and we'll go. 

CAROL

No, nothing here, let's go. (Carol, George and Jerry head for the door. Carol opens it.) Oh, I forgot to tell you. After I talked to you today my neighbour called me and played my messages to me over the phone. 

GEORGE

Oh, uh... 

CAROL

Yours were hilarious, we were both cracking up. I just love jokes like that. 

JERRY

I love my phone machine. I wish I was a phone machine. I wish if I saw somebody on the street I didn't want to talk to, I could go, 'Excuse me, I'm not in right now. If you would just leave a message, I could walk away.' I also have a cordless phone, but I don't like that as much, because you can't slam down a cordless phone. You get mad at somebody on a real phone ' 'You can't talk to me like that!' Bang! You know. You get mad at somebody on a cordless phone ' 'You can't talk to me like that!' 

JERRY

What did you do? 

KRAMER

Mousse. I moussed up. 

ELAINE

I guess it was just a matter of time. 

KRAMER

You know, I should've done this years ago. I mean, I feel like I've had two lives. My pre-mousse. And now, I begin my post-mousse. Hey, tell me the truth, have you ever seen a better looking guy? 

JERRY

Well, looks are so subjective. 

ELAINE

I don't mean to interrupt or anything, but on Sunday, my friend is having a brunch for the New York Marathon. 

KRAMER

(annoyed that he forgot) Oh, I keep forgetting to enter that! 

ELAINE

She lives right above First Avenue, says she has a perfect view of the race. And she said I can invite some friends. 

JERRY

Maybe. 

HAROLD

(O.S.) No, I'm not going up there. 

JERRY

(to Elaine) Harold and Manny. 

HAROLD

I'm not going. 

JERRY

Boys, boys. 

HAROLD

Oh, Jerry. 

JERRY

I slid the rent under your door, Harold. Did you get it? 

HAROLD

Yeah, yeah... Hey, Jerry, would you like anything from Mrs. Hudwalker's apartment? 

MANNY

(in Spanish) You can't give him anything from there! 

HAROLD

I was only joking. (to Jerry) He thinks I'm gonna give you Mrs. Hudwalker's things. 

MANNY

(in Spanish) You offered them to him. 

HAROLD

(to Jerry) We have to go up there now and clean the apartment. It's a good thing her rent was overdue. She'd be rotting up there for a month. 

JERRY

She died? Mrs. Hudwalker died? 

HAROLD

Ninety-four years old. I found her yesterday. She didn't have her wig on. It was horrifying. 

MANNY

(in Spanish) Harold, Come on, hurry up! 

HAROLD

(to Manny) What's the matter with you? I'm talking! So, Jerry, you know anyone who needs an apartment? 

JERRY

Are you kidding? You know my friend Elaine? 

HAROLD

Oh yeah, I like her. She always says hello to me. 

JERRY

It's not promised to anybody? 'Cause she'd take it in a second. 

HAROLD

Well, Manny wanted it for his brother, but he got deported. 

MANNY

(in spanish) What do you mean deported? It was a misunderstanding with the Department of Immigration. 

HAROLD

What's the difference? It's true! 

JERRY

So, it's okay? I could just tell her she can have it? 

HAROLD

Sure, sure. She's getting a bargain, too. It's only four hundred dollars a month. 

MANNY

(in Spanish) Four hundred dollars? What are you nuts? Someone will pay more. 

HAROLD

Okay... 

HAROLD

Okay! 

KRAMER

Hey, Harold, what do you think? 

HAROLD

Manny, look. Kramer put mousse in his hair. 

MANNY

(in Spanish) It looks worse. 

KRAMER

(not understanding him) Hey, thanks. 

ELAINE

What was that all about? 

JERRY

(coyly) Oh, nothing important. 

ELAINE

What's going on? What is that look? 

JERRY

What look? Nothing. 

ELAINE

Something's going on here. 

JERRY

I don't know if you should sit for this or not. Sitting is good if you faint, but standing is good for jumping up and down. I can't decide. 

ELAINE

Jumping up and down? What are you talking about? C'mon. Cough it up. 

JERRY

Oh, Elaine. You know the way I am ' rarely ever thinking of myself. My only concern is the welfare and happiness of those close to me. Sure, it hurts sometimes to give, and give, and give... 

ELAINE

Would you please? 

JERRY

What would you say if I told you that... 

ELAINE

Told me what?! 

JERRY

...I got you an apartment in this building. 

ELAINE

(dumbfounded) No. 

JERRY

Yes. 

ELAINE

No. 

JERRY

Yes. 

ELAINE

You didn't. 

JERRY

I did. 

ELAINE

You got me an apartment in the building?! 

JERRY

I got you an apartment in the building. 

ELAINE

How did you... 

JERRY

Remember Mrs. Hudwalker? The ninety-four-year-old woman who lived above me? 

ELAINE

No. 

JERRY

She died. 

ELAINE

(thrilled) She died?! 

JERRY

She died. 

ELAINE

She died! 

JERRY

And the rent is only four hundred dollars a month! 

ELAINE

Get out! 

ELAINE

Four hundred a month? Only four hundred a month?! 

JERRY

Four hundred a month. 

ELAINE

And I'll be right upstairs? 

JERRY

Right upstairs. 

ELAINE

Right above you? 

JERRY

Right above me. 

ELAINE

Oh, we're neighbors. I'll be here all the time! 

JERRY

All the time. 

ELAINE

(overly excited) We can exchange keys so we can come in and out. Oh, this is going to be great! 

JERRY

All the time. 

JERRY

The problem with talking is that nobody stops you from saying the wrong thing. I think life would be a lot better if it was like you're always making a movie. You mess up, somebody just walks on the set, and stops the whole shot. You know what I mean? Think of the things you wish you could take back. You're out somewhere with people, 'Gee, you look pregnant.. are you?' 'Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, that's not gonna work at all. Walk out the door, and come back in. Let's take this whole scene again. People, think about what you're saying!' 

GEORGE

Thanks, see you later, Donna. 

GEORGE

What happened to you? 

JERRY

You can't believe what I just did. 

GEORGE

What? What did you do? 

JERRY

I could tell you what I did, but you wouldn't believe it. It's not believable. 

GEORGE

What did you do? 

JERRY

How could I have done that? 

GEORGE

Done what? 

JERRY

I told Elaine about an apartment opening up in my building. She's going to move in. 

GEORGE

Elaine's moving into your building? 

JERRY

Yes. Right above me. 

GEORGE

Right above you? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

GEORGE

You're gonna be neighbors. 

JERRY

I know. Neighbors. 

GEORGE

She's right above you? 

JERRY

Right above me. 

GEORGE

How could you do that? 

JERRY

'Cause I'm an idiot! You may think you're an idiot, but with all due respect, I'm a much bigger idiot than you are. 

GEORGE

Don't insult me, my friend. Remember who you're talking to. No one's a bigger idiot than me. 

JERRY

Did you ever ask an ex-girlfriend to move into your building? 

GEORGE

Did you ever go to a singles weekend in the Pocono's? 

JERRY

She's right in my building! Right above me! Every time I come in the building, I'm gonna have to sneak around like a cat burglar. 

GEORGE

You're doomed. You're gonna have to have all your sex at women's apartments. It'll be like a permanent road trip. Forget about the home bed advantage. 

JERRY

But I need the home bed advantage. 

GEORGE

Of course. We all do. 

JERRY

Come in for two minutes and sit with me. 

GEORGE

I was just in there. It's embarrassing. 

JERRY

Oh, who's gonna know? 

GEORGE

They saw me walk out. 

JERRY

Two minutes. 

JERRY

My censoring system broke down. You know that little guy in your head who watches everything you say? Makes sure you don't make a mistake? He went for a cup of coffee. And in that second ruined my life. 

GEORGE

My censor quit two years ago. He checked into a clinic. Emotionally exhausted. 

JERRY

So, is there any way out of this Elaine thing? 

GEORGE

Tough. 

JERRY

You know, the water pressure's terrible in my building. And she loves a good shower. 

GEORGE

I never heard of anyone would turned down an apartment because of a weak shower spray. 

JERRY

If they were fanatic about showers, they might. 

GEORGE

For that rent, she'd take a bath in the toilet tank if she had to. 

JERRY

Look at that woman feeding her baby greasy, disgusting, coffee shop corned beef hash. Isn't that child abuse? 

GEORGE

I'd like to have a kid. Of course, you have to have a date first... Remember my friend, Adam, from Detroit? 

JERRY

Yeah, the guy with the flat head. 

GEORGE

He's a cube. Anyway, he got married six months ago. He told me ever since he's been wearing a wedding band, women have been coming on to him everywhere he goes. 

JERRY

Yeah, I've heard that about wedding bands. 

GEORGE

I wonder if that's really true. 

JERRY

That would be an interesting sociological experiment. You know, Kramer has his father's band. He'd loan it to you. 

GEORGE

Thanks a lot. I'll give it back to you in a week. 

KRAMER

You know, I don't even know why you're fooling around with this ring. I've been telling you, get yourself some plugs. Or a piece. 

GEORGE

I'm not doing that. 

KRAMER

Oh, man. You know, you're crazy. You're a good looking guy. What do you want to walk around like that for? 

GEORGE

No, I'll put half a can of mousse in my head like you. 

HAROLD

I told you I don't like these sponges, they're too small! I want a big sponge! 

HAROLD

You can't pick up anything with these! There's no absorption! 

JERRY

Boys, boys. 

HAROLD

Hi, Jerry. 

MANNY

Hello, Jerry. (in spanish to Harold) You tell him. 

HAROLD

Okay 

MANNY

(in spanish to Harold again) You tell him. 

HAROLD

Your friend can't have the apartment, Jerry. 

JERRY

What? 

HAROLD

Because somebody offered Manny five thousand dollars for the apartment. I don't want to do it. Manny wants to do it. 

MANNY

(in spanish) Why are you telling him it's my fault? 

HAROLD

Because it's true! Why shouldn't I tell him? 

JERRY

Hey, hey. I understand. You're businessmen. 

MANNY

(in spanish) Tell him that if his friend can come up with the same money then she can have the apartment. 

HAROLD

Oh, now, he says that if your friend has five thousand dollars, we'll give it to her. 

JERRY

Well, that's a lot of money. But, if that's the way it's gotta be, that's the way it's gotta be. 

JERRY

You know, I used to think that the universe is a random, chaotic sequence of meaningless events, but I see now that there is reason and purpose to all things. 

GEORGE

What happened to you? 

JERRY

Religion, my friend, that's what happened to me. Because, I have just been informed that it's going to cost Elaine the sum of five thousand dollars to get the apartment upstairs. 

GEORGE

(jubilant) Five thousand dollars? She doesn't have five thousand dollars! 

JERRY

Of course she doesn't have five thousand dollars! 

GEORGE

So, she can't get the apartment. 

JERRY

Can't get it. 

GEORGE

So, she doesn't move in. 

JERRY

No move. So, you see, it's all part of a divine plan. 

GEORGE

And how does the baldness fit into that plan? 

JERRY

(to the intercom) Elaine? 

ELAINE

Yeah. 

JERRY

(to George) All right, this is going to require some great acting now. I have to pretend I'm disappointed. You're going to really see me being a phony, now. I hope you can take this. Maybe you should go in the other room. 

GEORGE

Are you kidding? I lie every second of the day. My whole life is a sham! 

JERRY

'Cause you know, I love Elaine. 

GEORGE

Of course you do. 

JERRY

But you know... not in the building. Really, I feel terrible about this. My intentions were good. What can I do? Tell me. 

ELAINE

(to someone in the hallway) No, I'll be seeing you. (She enters the apartment; singing) 'Good morning, good morning..' (to Jerry and George) Have you ever gotten up in the morning and felt it's great to be alive? That every breath is a gift of sweet life from above? 

ELAINE

Oh, and before I forget, I have the checks for the first month, last month's security deposit. (laughs) I have seventy-five dollars left in my account. 

JERRY

Well... there's a little bit of a problem. 

ELAINE

Oh, I know. There's a weak shower spray, I know. I've already thought about it, and I'm switching to baths. As Winston Churchill said, 'Why stand when you can sit?' Maybe I'll get some rubber duckies. 

JERRY

Uh, no uh, someone offered Harold and Manny five thousand for the apartment. I'm sure they'd just as soon give it to you, but you'd have to come up with that money. 

ELAINE

Five thousand dollars? I don't have five thousand dollars. 

JERRY

I know. 

ELAINE

(disappointed) How am I going to get five thousand dollars? 

JERRY

I have no idea. 

KRAMER

(to Elaine) Hey, my new neighbor! 

ELAINE

I'm not moving in. 

KRAMER

What? 

ELAINE

They want five thousand dollars now. 

KRAMER

So, okay uh what's the problem? 

ELAINE

I don't have five thousand dollars. 

KRAMER

C'mon, you can come up with five thousand dollars. (to Jerry) Jerry, you don't have five thousand dollars you can led her? Come on. 

JERRY

Yeah, well, I didn't- Is that something you want to borrow? 

ELAINE

No, that's too much money to borrow. 

KRAMER

Loan her the money. You can afford it. 

JERRY

She doesn't wanna borrow the money. 

KRAMER

Oh, c'mon. She'll pay you back. What's five grand between friends? 

ELAINE

Of course I'd pay you back.. 

KRAMER

Yeah, so what's the problem? 

JERRY

Who said there's a problem? 

KRAMER

Hey see He said he'd loan you the money. 

ELAINE

Well Jerry, it might take a while for me to pay you back. Maybe a few years. How do you feel about that? 

KRAMER

That's okay. He doesn't care. 

ELAINE

Well, you know, money can sometimes come between friends. 

KRAMER

Get outta here. 

ELAINE

Let me think about it. 

KRAMER

What's to think about? 

ELAINE

I don't know... I don't know. Five thousand... let me just take one more look at it. 

JERRY

(to Kramer) It was all over! Taken care of. Done! Finished. Five thousand. Where's she gonna get five thousand? She doesn't have five thousand. Clean. Good bye. She's gone. Then you come in, 'Why don't you loan her five thousand? What do you care? You've got five thousand. Give her five thousand!' 

KRAMER

You didn't want her in the building? 

JERRY

No, I didn't! 

KRAMER

Well, then what did you loan her the five thousand for? Oh, look, maybe she won't take it. I mean, she did say that she was gonna think about it. 

JERRY

People don't turn down money. It's what separates us from the animals. 

KRAMER

I still don't understand what the problem is having her in the building. 

JERRY

Let me explain something to you. You see, you're not normal. You're a great guy, I love you, but you're a pod. I, on the other hand, am a human being. I sometimes feel awkward, uncomfortable, even inhibited in certain situations with the other human beings. You wouldn't understand. 

KRAMER

Because I'm a pod? 

ELAINE

I'll take it! 

ROXANNE

Hi, Elaine. 

ELAINE

Oh, hi, Roxanne. Nice to be here. These are my friends. This is George, and this is Jerry. 

JERRY

Hi 

ELAINE

Jerry's the one who got me my new apartment. 

ROXANNE

So, you're Elaine's hero. 

JERRY

Yes, it's my life's work. 

ROXANNE

There are so few true heroes left in this world. 

GEORGE

Yeah, my wife couldn't make it today. She's got something with her mother... Who knows what's going on with her. Don't let any one kid you, it's tough. 

JERRY

Well, better load up on some carbos before the race. 

ROXANNE

Oh, the marathon is great, isn't it? 

JERRY

Oh, yes. Particularly if you're not in it. 

ROXANNE

I wish we had a view of the finish line. 

JERRY

What's to see? A woman from Norway, a guy from Kenya, and twenty thousand losers. 

GEORGE

...yeah, my wife started getting on me about the lawn today. I'm tellin' you, it's one thing after another. 

RITA

Is she here? 

GEORGE

Uh no no, she's working. 

RITA

What does she do? 

GEORGE

She's an... etymologist. You know, bees, flies, gnats. W-What about you? 

RITA

I work for the Director of Madison Square Garden. It's great! I can get free tickets to any sporting in New York. Anyway, she's a very luck woman. Enjoy the race. 

GEORGE

(calling after her) But.. 

ROXANNE

Hi Stan. Joanne. 

ELAINE

Jerry, this is Joanne, and this is Stan. They're in my short story class with Roxanne and me. 

JERRY

Hi how are ya? 

ELAINE

Hey, Jerry just got me a great apartment in his building! 

JOANNE

Well, Jerry, it'll be nice having a close friend nearby. 

JERRY

(no amused) Fantastic. 

STAN

She can pop in whenever she wants. 

JERRY

I know. 

JOANNE

She doesn't even need to knock! 

JERRY

It's tremendous. 

STAN

Anytime of day. 

JERRY

I'm in heaven. 

ELAINE

Oh, Rita come here. This is Jerry. He's the one who got me the apartment. 

RITA

Oh, hi. (calling to someone) Bob, this is the guy who got Elaine the apartment. 

GEORGE

I'm sorry, I don't see the big deal about being a matador. The bull charges, you move the cape, what's so hard? 

SUSIE

So uh, are you really married? Because, I've actually heard of single guys who wear wedding bands to attract women. 

GEORGE

(laughs) You'd have to be a real loser to try something like that. 

SUSIE

That's too bad, because I really have a thing for bald guys with glasses. 

RITA

Hey everybody! Here come the runners! 

ELAINE

(to Jerry) So you and Roxanne are hitting it off, huh? 

JERRY

Oh, I wouldn't quite say that. 

ELAINE

Really? From a distance, you seemed to be coming on to her. 

JERRY

I'm a guy ' it always looks like that. 

ELAINE

Because, I was thinking... are you at all concerned that living in the same building will, y'know... cramp our styles? 

JERRY

Nah... 

ELAINE

Because, I was worried that there might be a situation in which one of us come home with somebody, it could get a little uncomfortable. But, as long as you're okay with it, it's fine with me. 

JANICE

I've never been able to be with just one person. I can, however, carry on strictly physical relationships which can last for years and years. It's a shame you're married. 

GEORGE

Umm, I'm not. It's just a sociological experiment! 

JANICE

Please... 

JERRY

You have no idea what an idiot is. Elaine just gave me a chance to get out and I didn't take it. (pointing to himself) This is an idiot. 

GEORGE

Is that right? I just threw away a lifetime of guilt-free sex, and floor seats for ever sporting event in Madison Square Garden. So please, a little respect. For I am Costanza: Lord of the Idiots! 

ROXANNE

(yelling out the window) You're all winners! 

GEORGE

But suddenly, a new contender has emerged... 

JERRY

George, I didn't sleep at all last night. I decided I have to tell her. I'm just going to be honest. That's all... Yes, I'm nervous... Are you listening to me?... Just put some soap on your finger. It'll slide right off... Then try axle grease... (Kramer enters; to the phone) I'll call you back after I talk to her... Bye. 

KRAMER

Well, it's all taken care of. Everything's cool. 

JERRY

What? What's cool? 

KRAMER

Elaine. 

JERRY

What are you talking about? 

KRAMER

I just found a guy who's willing to pay ten thousand dollars for the apartment. 

JERRY

You what?! Get out! (pushes Kramer) Ten thousand? 

KRAMER

Cash. 

JERRY

Who would pay that much? 

KRAMER

He's in the music business. 

JERRY

Elaine would never borrow that much money! (Jerry hugs Kramer, then grabs him by the cheeks.) Kramer, my God, man! This is beautiful! I think I'm in the clear here. Elaine's not moving in. I don't have to confront her. She has no idea I never wanted her to move in. I'm golden! 

KRAMER

Well, occasionally I like to help the humans. 

ELAINE

Wow. You're right. That is loud. 

JERRY

It's just unbelievable. 

ELAINE

They rehearse all the time? 

JERRY

All the time. I've been up there six times. They refuse to stop. I can't live like this. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I'm heading for breakdown! (to Harold) Can't you do something? 

HAROLD

I'm not going up. It stinks up there. 

JERRY

Manny... 

MANNY

(in Spanish) They're allowed to play until eleven o'clock! 

HAROLD

I'm not the one who said eleven o'clock. He makes up his own rules. 

ELAINE

Boy, too bad. If I was up there, you'd never hear a peep out of me. I'm as quiet as a mouse. 

KRAMER

Oh, I love the one they do right after this one! (Starts dancing) 

JERRY

I don't know. What do you do when a neighbor is making, like, a lot of noise at three o'clock in the morning? I mean, can you knock on someone's door and tell them to keep it down? You're really altering your whole self-image. I mean, what am I, Fred Mertz now? What's happening to me? Can I do this? Am I a shusher? I used to be a shushee. There's a lot of shushing going on in movie theaters. People are always shushing. 'Shh... shh... shhh... shhh...' Doesn't work, 'cause nobody knows where a shush is coming from. They just hear a shh. 'Was that a shush? I think somebody just shushed me.' Some people you can't shush in a movie theater. There's always that certain group of people, isn't it? They're talking and talking, and everyone around them is shushing them, and shushing them. They won't shush. They're the unshushables. 

JERRY

(to Kramer) To the right. 

GEORGE

That took awhile. 

JERRY

Don't get up. 

GEORGE

I'd like to help, but my neck.. 

GEORGE

So how long has it been in the basement? 

JERRY

Since my grandfather died. I was suppose to send it down to my parents in Florida, but they didn't want it. They told me to get rid of it, but I felt funny and then I sort of forgot about it. And it's been sitting down there for three years until he saw it. (to Kramer) All right, so, just take what you want and let's get it out of here. 

GEORGE

What's in it? 

JERRY

Grandpa clothes, I can't wear 'em. 

KRAMER

You want these? Knee socks. You don't wear knee socks. 

JERRY

No, go ahead. Look at this place. I can't wait to get it cleaned. 

GEORGE

I know someone who'll do it. She's good. She's honest. 

JERRY

No, Elaine's got this writer friend from Finland, Rava. Her boyfriend goes to Columbia grad school, and he's suppose to do it. 

GEORGE

Students can't clean. It's anathema. (explaining) They don't like it. 

JERRY

How long have you been waiting to squeeze that into a conversation? 

KRAMER

Now this I like. 

GEORGE

Wait a second. (George gets up and heads for the statue in Kramer's hands.) I can't believe this! Let me see this. 

KRAMER

Wait, wait, wait... 

GEORGE

Let me just see it. 

KRAMER

Come on... 

GEORGE

Let me just see it for a second. 

GEORGE

Oh my God, it's exactly the same! 

JERRY

What? 

GEORGE

When I was ten years old, my parents had this very same statue on the mantle of our apartment. Exactly. And, one day, I grabbed it, and I was using it as a microphone. I was singing, 'MacArthur Park', and I got to the part about, 'I'll never have that recipe again,' and it slipped out of my hand and it broke. My parents looked at me like I smashed the ten commandments. To this day, they bring it up. It was the single most damaging experience in my life, aside from seeing my father naked. 

KRAMER

C'mon, George. I saw it first. 

GEORGE

No, Kramer. I have to have this statue. 

KRAMER

No, I got dibs! 

GEORGE

What? No dibs! I need this statue. C'mon, give it! 

JERRY

Spread out, spread out you numbskulls. Why don't you just settle it like mature adults? 

KRAMER

Potato man! 

GEORGE

No, no, no potato man. Inka-dink. 

KRAMER

Okay...yea well uh start with me. 

GEORGE

Yeah, good, good. 

JERRY

Inka-dink, a bottle of ink, the cork fell out, and you stink. 

JERRY

Not because you're dirty, not because you're clean ' just because you kissed the girl behind the magazine... 

JERRY

And you are it! 

KRAMER

What?! Wait a minute. No, no, no. What are you doing? No, no, oh, oh, okay. He's out. I get it. 

GEORGE

No, no, no, no, I'm It. I win. 

JERRY

No, he's It. He wins. It is good. 

KRAMER

Do over ' start with him. 

JERRY

No, no, no, come on, Kramer. Now, you got the socks. 

KRAMER

All right, you can have it. (Kramer tosses the statue to George.) 

GEORGE

(not expecting the statue to be thrown) Dit. 

KRAMER

Okay, I'm gonna take the suit, and the shoes, and the hat. 

JERRY

All right, c'mon. Let's go. 

KRAMER

Hey, I look like Joe Friday in Dragnet. 

GEORGE

I can't believe I won at Inka-dink. 

JERRY

Come on, let's go. 

GEORGE

Yea. 

JERRY

Aren't you gonna take it? 

GEORGE

No, no, no, I don't want to carry it around all night. I'll pick it up later. 

GEORGE

(to Kramer) What about your stuff? 

KRAMER

Oh, uh, well - okay. 

JERRY

All right, let's go. Hey, you know, you owe me one. 

GEORGE

What? 

JERRY

The Inka-dink.. You were It. 

GEORGE

It's bad? 

JERRY

It's very bad. 

RAVA

Well, if they don't let you be my editor on this book, I'll go to another publisher. It's that simple. 

ELAINE

You told them that? 

RAVA

Of course. 

ELAINE

(excited) This is so fantastic. I don't know how to thank you. 

JERRY

(to Rava) So, where's this boyfriend of yours? I can't wait much longer. I've got a flight. 

ELAINE

Oh, probably caught in traffic. 

RAVA

Or maybe he's dead. 

JERRY

So what do you write, children's books? 

RAVA

That's Ray. 

RAY

Ah, greetings, greetings, and salutations. I beg your forgiveness. My tardiness was unavoidable. Rava, my love. Elaine, my dear friend. And you must be Jerry. Lord of the manor. Ah, my liege. A pleasure to serve you. 

JERRY

All right... 

RAVA

And we have to get back to work. 

JERRY

I gotta get to the airport. 

RAY

Your palace shall sparkle like the stars in heaven upon your save arrival, Sire. 

JERRY

The uh toilet brush is under the sink. 

JERRY

I don't really feel that comfortable with a maid, either, because there's that guilt when you have someone cleaning your house. You know, you're sitting there on your sofa, and they go by with the vacuum, 'I'm really sorry about this. I don't know why I left that stuff over there.' And that's why I could never be a maid, because I'd have an attitude. I'd find them, wherever they are in the house, 'Oh, I suppose you couldn't do this? No, don't get up, let me clean up your filth. No, you couldn't dust. No, this is too tough, isn't it?' 

JERRY

He really did an amazing job. Look! He uncoagulated the top of the dishwashing liquid! (Jerry opens refrigerator.) He cleaned out the bottom of the little egg cups! Come here, look at this. (He gets on his knees and points.) He cleaned the little one-inch area between the refrigerator and the counter. How did he get in there?! He must be like Rubber Man! 

ELAINE

There's no Rubber Man. 

JERRY

Why did I think there was a Rubber Man? There's Elastic Man... Plastic Man... 

ELAINE

I'm leaving. 

JERRY

Where are you going? 

ELAINE

To Rava's house. I've gotta pick up her manuscript. 

JERRY

Oh wait. I'll go with you. 

JERRY

Elaine, he Windexed the little peep hole! 

ELAINE

(to Rava) So, the meeting with Lippman is all set. He's the editor-in-chief! I think because of your request- 

RAVA

Demand. 

ELAINE

They're going to promote me to editor. 

RAVA

Daantotin. (There is a sound of the front door being unlocked.) There's Ray... late as usual. 

RAY

Well, this is an unexpected surprise ' and delight! The once and future king of comedy, Jerry the First, gracing our humble abode. Rava, we're in the presence of royalty. 

JERRY

Hey, Ray, listen, you really did a tremendous job cleaning that apartment. 

RAY

But I didn't just clean your apartment. It was a ritual, a ceremony, a celebration of life. 

JERRY

Shouldn't you be out on a ledge somewhere? 

RAVA

The water is boiling. Are you having tea? 

RAY

Yes. 

ELAINE

Jerry? Jerry! 

JERRY

What? 

RAVA

(from the kitchen) Ray, would you give me a hand? 

RAY

Yeah, I'm coming! 

JERRY

I think that's the statue from my house. That looks like the statue from my house! 

ELAINE

What statue? 

JERRY

I had a statue! 

ELAINE

You have a statue? I never saw a statue. 

JERRY

My grandfather gave me a statue! 

ELAINE

Since when? 

JERRY

What's the difference?! That's the one! He ripped me off! This guy ripped me off! 

RAY

Do you take sugar? 

ELAINE

Uhh... no. 

JERRY

I can't believe it! This guy ripped me off! 

ELAINE

Do you realize what you're saying? 

JERRY

Yes! This guy ripped me off! He stole that statue right out of my house! 

RAY

Lemon? 

ELAINE

Uh... sure/yeah.. 

ELAINE

Are you sure? 

JERRY

Pretty sure! Ninety-nine percent sure. 

ELAINE

Ninety-nine percent sure?! 

RAY

Ah, sweet elixir. It's fragrant nectar a soothing balm for the soul. 

RAVA

Ah those are the pastries, Ray take care of that, I'm going to get Elaine the manuscript. 

RAY

Ah, the pastries! 

ELAINE

Maybe it just looks the same. Maybe it's just a coincidence. 

JERRY

Coincidence? This guy's in my apartment and then, just by coincidence, he has the same exact statue in his apartment? 

ELAINE

I never saw the statue. 

JERRY

I had a statue! What should I do? 

ELAINE

I don't know. 

JERRY

I'll call Kramer. He can check my house. 

ELAINE

Oh Jerry, don't blow this for me. 

JERRY

Don't worry. (whispering into the phone) Kramer! Kramer!... It's Jerry!... Jerry!... From next door!... Never mind where I am!... Yes, Jerry Seinfeld!... 

JERRY

Ma, I told you, just dip the bread in the batter, and put in right in the pan... Okay, bye. (Jerry hangs up; to Rava) My mother. She forgot how to make French toast. You know how mothers are. 

RAVA

My mother left us when I was six years old. All seven of us. We never heard from her again. I hope she's rotting in an alley somewhere! 

JERRY

My mom's down in Florida. She's got uh one of those condos. Hot down there in the summer. You ever been down there? 

RAY

I love these pastries. You know, in Scandinavian mythology, the pastries were the food of the gods. 

JERRY

Listen, uh I just remembered... I'm... uh, getting a facial. 

ELAINE

Oh, see you tomorrow morning. 

RAY

How about dinner? 

JERRY

No, I don't eat dinner. Dinner's for suckers. 

JERRY

Uh huh... Yeah... Okay, thanks anyway... Bye. 

JERRY

Nope, the cop says it's my word against his. There's nothing they can do. 

KRAMER

Let's go get him. 

JERRY

Yeah, right. 

GEORGE

We can't just let him get away with this. 

JERRY

Do you realize how crazy he had to be to do something like this? He knew I was gonna know it's missing, and he took it! And of all things to take! I left my watch, tape recorder, stereo. He's crazy. 

KRAMER

You wanna go get him? 

ELAINE

Well, then, if he's crazy you should just forget it. 

GEORGE

Forget it? I already called my parents. I told them to expect the surprise of a lifetime. My mother's making her roasted potatoes! 

ELAINE

George, do you realize that Rava has asked me to edit her book? 

GEORGE

Who is this Rava? 

KRAMER

I say we get him. 

ELAINE

No! 

GEORGE

Let me just call him. 

JERRY

I'll call him. (Jerry picks up the cordless phone. He points to the rotary phone on the coffee table. Kramer, George, and Elaine struggle for it.) Hello, Ray?... Hi, Ray, this is Rava's friend, Elaine's friend, Jerry... The King of Comedy, right. Listen, you know that statue on your mantle, the one with the blue lady? (He covers the reciever and yells at Kramer and George.) Would you shut up?! (to the phone) Yeah, you don't want to talk about it over the phone?.. You don't want Rava to hear?... Yeah, I understand... You know that coffee shop near my house, Monk's?... All right, tomorrow... One o' clock... Great, okay, bye. 

ELAINE

All right, look, look, look. Let's say he stole it. 

GEORGE

Oh, he stole it! 

ELAINE

C'mon, you can't do anything about it. The cops won't do anything. What, are you going to fight him? Why don't you just forget it? 

GEORGE

No. 

GEORGE

I thought you said one o'clock. 

JERRY

Relax, he's late. He's always late. It's part of his M.O. 

GEORGE

Remember, don't take any crap. 

JERRY

Yeah, yeah. Don't worry about it. 

GEORGE

I'll be right here. 

JERRY

That's comforting. Shh. He's coming. (to Ray) Ray? 

RAY

Oh, Jerry. I can't believe you asked me about that statue. Do you know how much trouble you could've got me into? 

JERRY

Well, I didn't... 

RAY

Rava was standing right next to me. I never told her where I got the statue. 

GEORGE

(muttering to himself) I wonder why. 

JERRY

Well, just give it back, and I won't say anything. 

RAY

Give it back? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

RAY

What are you talking about? 

JERRY

What are you talking about? 

GEORGE

What is he talking about? 

RAY

I'm talking about the statue. 

JERRY

Yeah, me too. 

RAY

Give it back to whom? 

JERRY

Me. 

GEORGE

Yeah, him. 

RAY

You? 

JERRY

Yeah. Me. 

RAY

I'm not getting this. 

GEORGE

You already got it. 

JERRY

Ray, I had a statue in my house. You were in my house ' and then I saw it in your house. 

RAY

What are you saying? 

JERRY

What am I saying? 

GEORGE

Take a wild guess. 

RAY

Are you saying I stole your statue? 

GEORGE

What a mind. 

JERRY

Well, I... 

RAY

I can't believe what I'm hearing. 

JERRY

I can't believe what I'm hearing. 

GEORGE

I can't believe what I'm hearing. 

RAY

For your information, I got that statue in a pawn shop. 

GEORGE

Pawn shop? 

JERRY

A pawn shop? 

RAY

Yes. In Chinatown with the money I earned cleaning people's apartments. 

GEORGE

Cleaning them out. 

JERRY

Oh, excuse me... Look, Ray, you were the only person in my house. 

RAY

What's behind this? It's Rava, isn't it? 

GEORGE

Again with the Rava. 

RAY

You want her. 

JERRY

No, she's a little too cheery for me. 

RAY

She's from Finland, for crying out loud. Finland! Do you understand?! 

JERRY

I know Finland. They're neutral. 

RAY

Is it me? Do I rub you the wrong way? 

JERRY

No, I actually find you quite charming. A bit verbose at times... 

GEORGE

'Oh, I find you so charming.' You wuss. 

JERRY

(to George) Did you call me a wuss? 

RAY

What did you say? 

JERRY

I said luss. I'm at a luss. 

RAY

I would just love to take you down to the shop where I got it. 

JERRY

That's not necessary. (George slams his menu down on the table repeatedly.) You know, maybe it's not that bad an idea. 

RAY

And I would love to. Nothing would please me more. But, unfortunately, the guy retired and moved to Singapore. 

GEORGE

Singapore?! Do you hear this? 

RAY

If you really want, maybe I can contact the guy in Singapore and have him make a photostat of the receipt and send it over. 

GEORGE

That's it! That's it! I can't take it. I can't take it anymore! You stole the statue! You're a theif! You're a liar! 

JERRY

George... 

RAY

Who is this? 

GEORGE

I'm the judge and the jury, pal. And the verdict is guilty! 

RAY

What's going on here? 

GEORGE

GUILTY! 

RAY

Your friend is crazy. 

GEORGE

Oh, I'm crazy! 

JERRY

George, george... 

RAY

I've got to get going. I have a class. 

GEORGE

Oh ho! Class, huh? At Columbia? Let me tell you something, pal. I called the registrar's office. I checked you out. They have no record of a Ray Thomas at that school! You liar! 

RAY

Well, that's because I'm registered under my full legal name, Raymond Thomas Wochinski. Ray Thomas is my professional name. 

GEORGE

You mean alias. 

RAY

You are starting to make me angry! 

GEORGE

Well, that was bound to happen. 

RAY

(to Jerry) I hope you think about what you've done here today. And if you want to call and apologize, you know where to reach me. 

JERRY

Hey, Ray. 

RAY

Yes? 

JERRY

How did you get the goop out of the top of the dishwashing liquid? It was like a brand-new nozzle! 

ELAINE

Nervous? 

RAVA

Why should I be? 

ELAINE

Yeah. Right. 

RAVA

Your notes are very insightful. 

ELAINE

The book is great. Did you go out last night? 

RAVA

No. We made love on the floor like two animals. Ray is insatiable. 

ELAINE

They all are. 

RAVA

Was Jerry? 

ELAINE

I can't remember. 

RAVA

You know, Ray is very upset over these accusations. 

ELAINE

Oh, well, I'm staying out of this one. This is between them. I am not getting involved. 

RAVA

So you think he stole it?! 

ELAINE

Well, you have to admit... the circumstantial evidence... 

RAVA

I admit nothing! 

MAN

Will you put that cigarette out, please? 

ELAINE

Well, I mean, he was in the apartment, and then it's gone and it's in your apartment. 

RAVA

Maybe you think we're in cahoots. 

ELAINE

No, no. But it is quite a coincidence. 

RAVA

Yes, that's all: a coincidence! 

ELAINE

A big coincidence. 

RAVA

Not a big coincidence. A coincidence! 

ELAINE

No, that's a big coincidence. 

RAVA

That's what a coincidence is! There are no small coincidences and big coincidences! 

ELAINE

No, there are degrees of coincidences. 

RAVA

No, there are only coincidences! Ask anyone! 

RAVA

Are there big coincidences and small coincidences, or just coincidences? Well?! Well?! 

MAN

Will you put that cigarette out?! 

RAVA

Maybe I put it out on your face! (To Elaine) It's just like Ray said. You and Jerry are jealous of our love. You're trying to destroy us. 

ELAINE

Shouldn't you be out on a ledge somewhere? 

GEORGE

Ma, will you stop?... It's just a statue!... How is it my fault?!... It was stolen. I didn't even touch it this time... Okay, fine... I don't see why this should affect to potatoes!... Okay... Goodbye. (George hangs up.) She doesn't react to disappointment very well. Unlike me. 

KRAMER

I'm not happy about this. 

ELAINE

Why don't we just throw a Molotov cocktail through their window? 

GEORGE

There's just no justice. This experience has changed me. It's made me more cynical, more bitter, more jaded. 

JERRY

Really? 

GEORGE

(casually) Sure, why not. 

ELAINE

Well, how do you think I feel? Instead of editing the first novel of a major young writing talent, I am proofreading a food allergy cookbook. 

JERRY

Can't you talk to your boss? 

ELAINE

I did. He loves Rava. Worse, he loves Ray. And he didn't think you're funny at all. 

KRAMER

(talking to himself) I'm not happy about this. 

JERRY

Well, perhaps we can take comfort in the knowledge that in the next world, Ray will be the recipient of a much larger and more harsh brand of justice.. 

GEORGE

Yeah, he'll have my parents. 

KRAMER

(from the other side of the door) Police! Open up! 

RAY

Police? 

KRAMER

Freeze, mother! 

RAY

Hey. 

KRAMER

Shut up. Spread 'em. I said spread 'em! (looks around) You're in big trouble son. Burglary, grand larceny, possession of stolen goods... and uh, uh... murder. 

RAY

Murder?! 

KRAMER

Shut up! Keep 'em spread! Just make love to that wall, pervert! 

RAY

I think you have me confused with somebody else. 

KRAMER

Is your name Ray? 

RAY

Yeah. 

KRAMER

Yeah, you're the punk I'm looking for! 

RAY

Hey, hey, are you a cop? 

KRAMER

Yeah, I'm a cop. I'm a good cop. I'm a damn good cop! (On that line, Kramer points to Ray, and Ray turns back to the wall. Kramer heads for the door.) Today's your lucky day, junior, 'cause I'm gonna let you off with a warning. Any more of this criminal activity, and you'll be sorry. You got me? 

RAY

Got you? I don't even know what the hell you're talking about. 

KRAMER

Good, good. Let's uh keep it that way. 

JERRY

All right, all right. What's the big hubbub, bub? 

GEORGE

Kramer, I can't believe it. Oh, you're my hero! 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

JERRY

Kramer, what did you do? 

KRAMER

Well, let's just say I didn't take him to People's Court. 

GEORGE

I feel like a huge weight's been lifted off my shoulders. I... I... I feel happy! Kramer, I don't know how to thank you! 

KRAMER

Well, I'll think of something. 

JERRY

People are going to steal from you. You can't stop them. But, everybody has their own little personal security things. Things that they think will foil the crooks, you know? In your own mind, right? You go to the beach, go in the water, put your wallet in the sneaker, who's gonna know? What criminal mind could penetrate this fortress of security? I tied a bow. They can't get through that. I put the wallet down by the toe of the sneaker. They never look there. They check the heel, they move on. 

LEVITAN

(on the phone) Ha ha, she was great. You don't want to know. Hey Breaky, remind me to tell you what we did in Lake George. (laughing) Get this...I got it all on video. (laughing)  

GEORGE

That's it. This is it. I'm done. Through. It's over. I'm gone. Finished. Over. I will never work for you again. Look at you. (laughing) You think you're an important man? Is that what you think? You are a laughingstock. You are a joke. These people are laughing at you. You're nothing! You have no brains, no ability, nothing! (knocking object over on desk) I quit!  

KRAMER

Hey.  

JERRY

Hey.  

KRAMER

Boy, I have really had it with Newman. He wakes me up again last night at three o'clock in the morning to tell me he's going up onto the roof to kill himself.  

JERRY

Well, what'd you say?  

KRAMER

I said ' Jump.' Well, he's been threatening to do this for years. I said ' Look, if you're gonna kill yourself do it already and stop bothering me.' At least I'd respect the guy for accomplishing something.  

JERRY

What's his problem?  

KRAMER

No job. No women.  

JERRY

He called the right guy.  

KRAMER

Well, what am I supposed to tell him? How much there is for him to live for? Why should I lie to him?  

JERRY

All right, I'm leaving. I going to the laundry.  

KRAMER

Why don't you use the machines down in the basement?  

JERRY

Fluff and Fold. The only way to live. (snapping fingers in tune with words) I drop it off. I pick it up. It's a delight.  

KRAMER

How 'bout if I put a few things --  

JERRY

Wait a sec. I don't wanna do --  

KRAMER

Well, you're going over there.  

JERRY

I don't wanna mix in everything! My guys don't know your guys. You can't just lock 'em all in the same machine together. They'll start a riot.  

KRAMER

Have you ever met my guys?  

JERRY

No. I can't say as I have.  

KRAMER

Well!  

JERRY

All right. Put 'em on top.  

KRAMER

Ah!  

JERRY

Oh, beautiful.  

JERRY

This stuff on top is my friends. Could I get it done in a separate machine?  

VIC

I'll have to charge you for another machine.  

JERRY

Whatever it costs. In fact, I would prefer it if the machines are not even touching each other. Because something could, you know, jump across.  

GEORGE

Guess what.  

JERRY

How did you know I was here?  

GEORGE

Kramer. Guess what.  

JERRY

I don't know.  

GEORGE

I quit my job.  

JERRY

Get outta here.  

GEORGE

I couldn't take it anymore.  

VIC

You can have this on Monday. (hands Jerry a ticket) 

JERRY

What happened? Levitan?  

GEORGE

I go in to use his private bathroom, everybody uses it, and then I get a memo - a memo - telling me to use the men's room in the hall. Well, (laughing) I mean we share it with Pace Electronics. It's disgusting!  

JERRY

You and your toilets.  

GEORGE

I snapped! It was the last straw. (sighs)  

JERRY

So, what are you gonna do now? Are you gonna look for something else in real estate?  

GEORGE

Nobody's hiring now. The market's terrible.  

JERRY

So what are you gonna do?  

GEORGE

I like sports. I could do something in sports.  

JERRY

Uh-huh. Uh-huh. In what capacity?  

GEORGE

You know, like the general manager of a baseball team or something.  

JERRY

Yeah. Well, that - that could be tough to get.  

GEORGE

Well, it doesn't even have to be the general manager. Maybe I could be like, an announcer. Like a color man. You know how I always make those interesting comments during the game.  

JERRY

Yeah. Yeah. You make good comments.  

GEORGE

What about that?  

JERRY

Well, they tend to give those jobs to ex-ballplayers and people that are, you know, in broadcasting.  

GEORGE

Well, that's really not fair.  

JERRY

I know. Well, okay. Okay. What else do ya like?  

GEORGE

Movies. I like to watch movies.  

JERRY

Yeah. Yeah.  

GEORGE

Do they pay people to watch movies?  

JERRY

Projectionists.  

GEORGE

That's true.  

JERRY

But you gotta know how to work the projector.  

GEORGE

Right.  

JERRY

And it's probably a union thing.  

GEORGE

(scoffs) Those unions. (sighs) Okay. Sports,...movies. What about a talk show host?  

JERRY

Talk show host. That's good.  

GEORGE

I think I'd be good at that. I talk to people all the time. Someone even told me once they thought I'd be a good talk show host.  

JERRY

Really?  

GEORGE

Yeah. A couple of people. I don't get that, though. Where do you start?  

JERRY

Well, that's where it gets tricky.  

GEORGE

You can't just walk into a building and say ' I wanna be a talk show host.'  

JERRY

I wouldn't think so.  

GEORGE

It's all politics.  

JERRY

All right. Okay. Sports, movies, talk show host. What else?  

GEORGE

This could have been a huge mistake.  

JERRY

Well, it doesn't sound like you completely thought this through.  

GEORGE

(sighs) Guess not. What should I do?  

JERRY

Maybe you can just go back.  

GEORGE

Go back?  

JERRY

Yeah. Pretend like it never happened.  

GEORGE

You mean just walk into the staff meeting on Monday morning like it never happened?  

JERRY

Sure. You're an emotional person. People don't take you seriously.  

GEORGE

Just..go back. Pretend the whole thing never happened.  

JERRY

Never happened.  

GEORGE

I was just blowin' off a little steam. So what?  

JERRY

So what? You're entitled.  

GEORGE

I'm emotional.  

JERRY

That's right. You're emotional.  

GEORGE

Never happened.  

JERRY

Never happened.  

JERRY

To me the most annoying thing about the couple of times that I did work in an office. Is that when you go in, in the morning you say Hi to everyone and for some reason throughout the day you have to continue to greet these people all day every time you see them. I mean you walk in 'morning Bill, morning Bob, how you doing? fine' Ten minutes later you see him in the hall, 'How ya doin'?' Every time you pass you gotta come up with another little greeting. You know you start racking your brains you know you do the little eyebrow 'Hey' You start coming up with nicknames for them. 'Jimbo.' 

GEORGE

How ya doin'?  

GLENDA

What are you doing here?  

GEORGE

What? I work here.  

GLENDA

I thought you quit.  

GEORGE

What quit? (laughing) Who quit?  

DAN

Bill, how was your weekend?  

BILL

Oh, excellent weekend. What about your weekend?  

DAN

Fine weekend.  

GEORGE

Yeah. Good weekend.  

DAN

Went up to the Cape. Took the kids sailing. (laughing) Lisa was a little scared at first, but that kids' gonna be a good sailor someday.  

GEORGE

Aw, she's gonna be a fine sailor.  

LEVITAN

Ava, what happened to you Friday afternoon?  

AVA

Oh, I got a little tied up.  

LEVITAN

I'll bet you did.  

LEVITAN

I wanna remind everyone that the tenth anniversary party for Rick Barr Properties is gonna be Wednesday afternoon at four o'clock in Lasky's Bar, on Madison 48th. I want all of you to be there. This really means a lot to me. Is that Costanza over there? What are you doing here?  

GEORGE

What?  

LEVITAN

Am I crazy, or didn't you quit?  

GEORGE

When?  

LEVITAN

Friday.  

GEORGE

Oh, what? What? That? Are you kidding? I didn't quit. What? You took that seriously?  

LEVITAN

You mean, laughingstock? All that stuff?  

GEORGE

Come on. Will you stop it.  

LEVITAN

No brains? No ability?  

GEORGE

Teasing.  

LEVITAN

Okay. I want you outta here.  

GEORGE

I don't know where you're getting this from. I....you're serious aren't you? Oh, (laughing) you see? You see, you just don't know my sense of humor. Dan, don't I joke around all the time? 

DAN

I wouldn't say all the time. 

LEVITAN

You can't win. You can't beat me. That's why I'm here and you're there. Because I'm a winner. I'll always be a winner and you'll always be a loser.  

GEORGE

' I'll always be a winner and you'll always be a loser.' This is what he said to me.  

JERRY

Well, so that's that.  

GEORGE

No. That's not that.  

JERRY

That's not that?  

GEORGE

No.  

JERRY

Well, if that's not that, what is that?  

GEORGE

I've got some plans. I got plans.  

JERRY

What kind of plans?  

GEORGE

What's the difference?  

JERRY

You don't wanna tell me?  

GEORGE

I'm gonna slip him a mickey.  

JERRY

What? In his drink? Are you outta your mind? What are you Peter Lorre?  

GEORGE

You don't understand. He's got this big party coming up. He's been looking forward to this for months. This is gonna destroy the whole thing.  

JERRY

What if you destroy him?  

GEORGE

No. No. No. No. No. Don't worry. It's perfectly safe. I researched it. He'll get a little woozy. He might keel over.  

JERRY

Well, wha - what does that do? Big deal.  

GEORGE

This is what they would do in the movies! It's a beautiful thing! It's like a movie! I'm gonna slip him a mickey!  

JERRY

You've really gone mental.  

GEORGE

Nah.  

JERRY

Where are you gonna get this mickey? I can't believe I'm saying 'mickey'!  

GEORGE

I got a source.  

JERRY

You got a mickey source?  

GEORGE

And Elaine is gonna keep him busy.  

JERRY

Elaine? How did you rope her into this?  

GEORGE

I told her what a sexist he is. How he cheats on his wife.  

JERRY

She knew that.  

GEORGE

But she didn't know he doesn't recycle.  

JERRY

What is the point of all this?  

GEORGE

Revenge.  

JERRY

Oh, the best revenge is living well.  

GEORGE

There's no chance of that.  

JERRY

Did you get your laundry?  

KRAMER

Yeah.  

JERRY

What's with you?  

KRAMER

He jumped.  

JERRY

What?  

KRAMER

Yeah. Newman jumped.  

JERRY

Did he call you last night?  

KRAMER

Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  

JERRY

What did you say?  

KRAMER

I said ' Wave to me when you pass my window.'  

JERRY

Whew. Did he wave?  

KRAMER

No! He jumped from the second floor. Mr. Papanickolous saw him from across the street. He's lying out there faking. See, he's trying to get back at me.  

JERRY

(realizing something) Oh, my god!  

KRAMER

What's the matter?  

JERRY

(tearing through his laundry bag) Well, on Thursday when I came home I had $1500 on me. For some reason I decided to hide it in my laundry bag and then I completely forgot about it...and then I took the laundry in on Friday! Oh, come on, let's go.  

KRAMER

Where? Where?  

JERRY

To the Laundromat.  

VIC

I never saw it.  

KRAMER

Okay. Come on. Give the guy his money. What -- what are you doing?  

VIC

Hey, you see that sign right there? (Points to a sign saying 'Not Responsible for Valuables' 

JERRY

Oh, I see. So, you put up a sign so you can do whatever you want? You're not a part of society.  

VIC

Yea that's right, 'cuz this place is my country and I'm the president, and that's my constitution. I'm not responsible.  

JERRY

So, anybody leaves anything here, you can just take it? You have a license to steal? You are like the James Bond of laundry?  

VIC

You ever hear of a bank?  

JERRY

Come on. Let's go.  

KRAMER

No. You can't let him get away with this.  

ELAINE

Which one is he?  

GEORGE

That's him over there. The one that looks like a blowfish.  

ELAINE

Oh, yeah. I see him.  

GEORGE

Yeah. Hey, thanks for doing this.  

ELAINE

Why pass up the opportunity to go to prison?  

GEORGE

This is by far the most exciting thing I've ever done.  

ELAINE

Yeah. It is kind of cool.  

GEORGE

First time in my life I've ever gotten back at someone.  

ELAINE

I can't believe we're doing this. This is the kind of thing they do in the movies.  

GEORGE

That's exactly what I told Jerry!  

ELAINE

Really?  

GEORGE

Yes! (both laugh) God, I've never felt so alive!  

JERRY

Maybe we should call this off.  

KRAMER

Come on. What's the big deal? Just gonna put a little concrete in the washing machine.  

JERRY

And what's gonna happen?  

KRAMER

Well, it'll gonna mix up with the water, and then by the end of the cycle it'll be a solid block!  

JERRY

If only you could put your mind to something worthwhile. You're like Lex Luthor.  

KRAMER

You keep him busy.  

KRAMER

Whoa!  

GEORGE

You go over there -  

ELAINE

Yeah.  

GEORGE

You start flirting with him and I'll come by and, while you're keeping him busy, I'll slip it in his drink.  

ELAINE

Wouldn't it be easier just to punch him in the mouth?  

LEVITAN

Come on! They're terrible. They got no infield.  

ELAINE

Oops! (bumps into Levitan) 'Scuse me.  

LEVITAN

Yeah.  

GREENY

I'm gonna get some food. You want some?  

LEVITAN

Nah.  

ELAINE

Hi.  

LEVITAN

Hi.  

ELAINE

(sneezes)  

LEVITAN

God bless you.  

ELAINE

Oh! Thank you. Thank you very much. (blowing nose) Really. I mean that. I am not one of those people who give insincere thank you's. No sir. No sir. When I thank someone I really thank them. So, thank... yoooou!  

LEVITAN

(confused) You're welcome.  

ELAINE

People don't say ' God bless you ' as much as they used to. Have you noticed that?  

LEVITAN

No.  

ELAINE

(having trouble getting him to pay attention) So, I'm going to a nudist colony next week.  

LEVITAN

(interested) Nudist colony?  

ELAINE

Oh, yeah. Yeah. I love nudist colonies. They help me..unwind. Aah!  

LEVITAN

(laughing) I'd never been to a nudist colony.  

ELAINE

Oh, really? Oh, you should go. They're great. They're great. Of course, when it's over, it's - it's hard to get used to all this clothing, you know. So, a lot of times, I'll just lock the door to my office and I'll just sit there naked.  

LEVITAN

Seriously?  

ELAINE

Oh, yeah. I usually work naked a...couple hours a day.  

GEORGE

(whispering) Glenda, can I ask you a favor? Can I have this seat?  

GLENDA

(loud) What do you have to sit here for? There are plenty of other seats.  

GEORGE

(whispering) I can't explain. It's very important that I sit here.  

GLENDA

(loud) What are you doing here anyway? I thought you were fired.  

GEORGE

(whispering angrily) Okay. Okay. Fine.  

ELAINE

I cook naked, I clean....I clean naked, I drive naked. Naked. Naked. Naked.  

LEVITAN

Who are you?  

ELAINE

Oh, you don't wanna know, mistah. I'm trouble. Big trouble.  

JERRY

(trying to divert Vic's attention) What about the gentle cycle? You ever use that?  

JERRY

Do you think it's effeminate for a man to put clothes in a gentle cycle?  

JERRY

What about fine fabrics? How do you deal with that kind of temperament?  

JERRY

What about stone washing? You ever witness one of those? That must be something. What? Do they just pummel the jeans with rocks?  

KRAMER

I didn't realize it was a full box.  

GEORGE

(trying again with Glenda) I'm gonna count to three. If you don't give up the chair, the wig is coming off.  

GLENDA

I don't' wear a wig.  

GEORGE

One... (Glenda seeing George is serious; gets up and leaves) 

ELAINE

No. No. No. No. No. I don't really have a phone. In fact, I - I really don't have an apartment. I kinda sleep around.  

ELAINE

I just like to have and few drinks and just let the guy do whatever he wants. Would you close your eyes for a second? I wanna tell you a secret about my bra.  

GEORGE

Hello, Rick.  

LEVITAN

Heh heh heh hey! Look who's here!  

GEORGE

That's right, Ricky Boy, it's me!  

LEVITAN

You know something, Costanza? I'm a very lucky man.  

GEORGE

Oh!  

LEVITAN

I've always been lucky. Things just seem to fall right in my lap.  

GEORGE

Boom!  

LEVITAN

You wouldn't believe it if I told you. In fact, uh, I'm glad you're here. You know, maybe I've been a little rough on ya, huh?  

GEORGE

Oh.  

LEVITAN

Why should we let petty, personal differences get in the way of business? I, uh, I want you to come back. (George is shocked) You can use my bathroom anytime you want.  

GEORGE

You want me to come back? Uh...  

LEVITAN

Hey! How about a toast, huh? Everybody, a toast!  

GEORGE

Rick.  

LEVITAN

Everyone, I wanna propose a toast to ten great years at Rick Barr Properties.  

GEORGE

Uh, Rick..  

LEVITAN

And all the people in this room, (clears throat) that made that possible..  

GEORGE

Rick.  

LEVITAN

I'd also like to welcome back into the fold our..our little shrimpy friend, George Costanza who, although he didn't really have a very good year -- how you blew that McConnell deal, I'll never know. But, hey, what the hell, huh? We've always enjoyed his antics around the office. Heh heh. Anything you wanna add to this?  

GEORGE

Drink up. (Levitan takes a drink) 

GEORGE

I like history. Civil War. Maybe I could be a professor, or something.  

ELAINE

Well, to teach something you really have to know a lot about it. I think you need a degree.  

JERRY

Yeah. That's true.  

KRAMER

(seeing Jerry is with people) Oh. 

JERRY

What? (Kramer hands Jerry an envelope) My God, the money! The 1500! Where'd you find it?  

KRAMER

It was in my laundry.  

JERRY

In your laundry the whole time? I told you not to mix in our guys. What did we figure the damage on that machine would be?  

KRAMER

It was about 1200 bucks.  

NEWMAN

Kramer!  

KRAMER

Oh! That's Newman. (goes over to the window) 

NEWMAN

I'm on the roof!  

KRAMER

(yelling up) Well, what are you waiting for?  

JERRY

Elaine, come on, take a walk with me down to the Laundromat. I gotta pay this guy the money..  

GEORGE

(talking to nobody) I like horses. Maybe I could be a stable boy.  

KRAMER

You wanna shoot some pool tonight?  

NEWMAN

I can't. I'm goin' to a movie.  

GEORGE

(talking to nobody) Nah. It's probably a union thing.  

JERRY

People like the idea of revenge. Have you ever heard the expression 'The best revenge is living well' I've said this, in other words it means supposedly the best way to get back at someone is just by being happy and successful in your own life. Sounds nice, doesn't really work on that Charles Bronson. kinda level. You know what I mean, those movies where his whole family gets wiped out by some street scum. You think you could go up to him, 'Charlie forgot about the 357 what you need is a custom-made suit and a convertible. New carpeting, french doors, a divan. That'll show those punks.' 

VOICE

(Germanic) Look, Sigmund. Look in the sky. The planets are on fire. It is just as you prophesied. The planets of our solar system, incinerating. Like flaming globes, Sigmund. Like flaming globes.. Ah, ha, ha, ha.. 

ELAINE

What do you got, a cucumber? 

GEORGE

Yeah, so what? 

ELAINE

You're bringing in an ouside cucumber? 

GEORGE

They refuse to put cucumber in the salad. I need cucumber. 

JERRY

(Trying to read the note) What have I done? I can't read this! Ful-hel-mo-nen-ter-val? I got up last night, I wrote this down, I thought I had this great bit. 

ELAINE

No. Let me see that. (Takes the paper from Jerry) Don't-mess-with-Johnny.' 

JERRY

Johnny? Johnny who? Johnny Carson? Did I insult Johnny on The Tonight Show? 

ELAINE

(Joking) Did you mess with Johnny, Jerry? 

GEORGE

Let me see that. (Studies the note) 

ELAINE

Hey, where's Kramer? 

JERRY

I don't know. That's like asking 'Where's Waldo?' 

GEORGE

(Still holding the note) I think I'm having a heart attack. 

JERRY

I don't think that's it. 

GEORGE

I'm not kidding. 

JERRY

What does that mean? 

ELAINE

I think what he's trying to say is that he's having a heart attack. 

JERRY

Oh, he's having a heart attack. 

GEORGE

Tightness.. 

JERRY

C'mon. 

GEORGE

Shortness of breath.. 

JERRY

Oh, this is ridiculous. 

GEORGE

Radiating waves of pain.. 

JERRY

I know what this is. You saw that show on PBS last night, Coronary Country. (To Elaine) I saw it in the TV Guide. I called him and told him to make sure and not watch it. 

GEORGE

There was nothing else on. Oh, the left arm.. the left arm. 

JERRY

(To Elaine) He saw that show on anorexia last year, and ate like an animal for two weeks. 

GEORGE

Why can't I have a heart attack? I'm allowed. 

JERRY

So what do you want? You want me take you to the hospital? 

GEORGE

Manhattan Memorial, less of a line. 

JERRY

I'll call an ambulance. (Exits) 

WAITRESS

Is everything alright? 

GEORGE

We'll just take a check. (She leaves the check. George, in all his cheapness, can't help but to review the check. He finds an error) You made a mistake on the.. 

ELAINE

George! 

MAN

Ooohhh... Argghhh.. 

GEORGE

Are.. are you okay? 

MAN

Ooooooohhh.. 

GEORGE

I'm George.. George Costanza.. I've never been in the hospital a day in my life.. except when I had my tonsils out. You know, they never gave me any ice cream. I always felt that- 

MAN

Shut up! 

JERRY

Well? What do you think? 

JERRY

'Salami salami bologna'? 

DOCTOR

(In a hurry) Oh, your friend's fine. He didn't have a heart attack. I'll be in - in a few minutes. 

JERRY

(Sarcastic) What a surprise. (Enters George's room overly sympathetic - leading George to think that the Doctor told Jerry something significant) Hey, how ya doin' buddy? You need anything? Do you want me to go out and get you a Superman comic? 

GEORGE

No, no thanks. 

JERRY

(Still going along with the practical joke) You know, I was wondering.. You know that Black Hawks jacket you have? 

GEORGE

Oh, sure, my Black Hawks jacket. I love my Black Hawks jacket. 

JERRY

Well, you know, I was thinking - if things don't exactly work out.. 

GEORGE

Well, it wouldn't fit you. The sleeves are too short. 

JERRY

No, I tried it on. It fits good. 

GEORGE

Well, I didn't really think about what I was gonna do with all.. 

JERRY

Well, you know.. 

GEORGE

(Reluctantly) Well, okay. 

JERRY

Oh, and.. do you think it would be alright if I called Susan Davis? 

GEORGE

Susan Davis? (Getting possessive) Hey, wait a second.. 

JERRY

Well, it's not like we'd be bumping into you. 

GEORGE

I don't know.. you and Susan Davis? 

JERRY

You know, if your future was a little more certain.. 

GEORGE

Okay, go ahead. Call her, get married, have babies, have a great life.. What do I care? I'm finished. (Really depressed) It's all over for me. In fact, let's end it right now. Jerry, kill me, kill me now. I'm begging you. Let's just get it over with. Be a pal.. Just take the pillow and put it over my face. 

JERRY

Well, ah.. (Takes his pillow) What? Kind of like this? (Violently smothers George with the pillow. George freaks out. He didn't think Jerry would actually do it) 

GEORGE

What are ya doing?! Whadya, crazy?! 

ELAINE

Jerry! 

JERRY

(Acts like he was cought red-handed) Elaine, what are you doing here? (Takes the pillow off George, and puts it back on his bed) 

GEORGE

(To Jerry) Jerk off. 

JERRY

(Whispering) There's nothing wrong with him. I saw the doctor. He's fine. 

ELAINE

Hi, George. How ya feeling? Is anybody getting your apartment? 

GEORGE

I'll tell ya, if I ever get out of here, I'm gonna change my life. I'm gonna do a whole Zen thing. Take up yoga, meditate.. I'll eat right. Calm down, lose my anger.. (Sees Jerry and Elaine aren't listening. He snaps) Hey, is anybody listening?! 

DOCTOR

(To Elaine) Uh, hello. (To George) Uh, Mr. Costanza? 

GEORGE

(Panicky) Uh, yeah. You know, Doctor, I gotta tell you, I feel a lot better. 

DOCTOR

Well, we looked at your EKG's, ran some tests, did a complete work-up. 

GEORGE

(Getting in a more panicked state) Oh God, Mommy! 

DOCTOR

And you simply haven't had a heart attack. 

GEORGE

(Relieved) I haven't? I'm okay? I'm okay? Oh, thank you, thank you, Doctor! I don't know how to thank you. 

JERRY

(Sarcastic) Hey, that was really fun, George. Can we go home now? 

DOCTOR

No, actually, we'd like to keep him here overnight for observation, just to be safe. 

GEORGE

Oh, sure. Sure, anything. Can you believe it? There's nothing wrong with me. 

DOCTOR

Well, I wouldn't go that far. 

GEORGE

(Starting to panic again) What? Oh my God. What? Is it meningitis? Scoliosis? Lupis?! Is it Lupis?! 

DOCTOR

Have you ever had your tonsils taken out? 

GEORGE

My tonsils? Yeah, when I was a kid. 

DOCTOR

Well, they've grown back. Your adenoids are swollen too. 

GEORGE

Really? 

ELAINE

(Jokingly hits the doctor) Whose tonsils grow back? (Laughs) 

DOCTOR

It happens. 

JERRY

Yeah, if you've been exposed to gamma rays. 

ELAINE

I still have my tonsils. Everyone in my family has their tonsils. In fact, we were forbidden to socialize with anyone who didn't have their tonsils. 

DOCTOR

That's interesting. Because, no one in my family has their tonsils, and we were forbidden to socialize with tonsil people. 

JERRY

(Sarcastically) Well, it's like the Capulets and the Montagues. 

GEORGE

(Drawing attention back to him) Excuse me! 

DOCTOR

Anyway, I strongly recommend they come out. 

GEORGE

What? You mean with a knife? 

DOCTOR

Yes. With a knife. You know, snip, snip. Anyway, you'd be completely under, you wouldn't feel a thing. And when you wake up, you can have some ice cream. 

GEORGE

(Angry) Yeah, that's what they told me the last time. 

DOCTOR

Think about it. (Turns to leave, but runs into Elaine) Excuse me. 

ELAINE

(Flustered) Oh, I'm sorry. (Doctor exits) I just.. have to ask that doctor one more question. (Leaves) 

JERRY

Women go after doctors like men go after models. They want someone with knowledge of the body.. we just want the body. 

KRAMER

Hey. 

JERRY

Hey. 

KRAMER

Boy, they got a great cafeteria downstairs. Hot food, sandwiches, a salad bar.. It's like a Sizzler's opened up a hospital! (Sits and starts eating) So, how did you have a heart attack? You're a young man. What were you doing? Are they gonna do a zipper job? Oh, they love to do zipper jobs. 

JERRY

(Trying to shut him up) Kramer. 

KRAMER

The really bad thing about the heart is the sex thing. See, you gotta be careful about sex now. You get that heart pumping and suddenly, boom! Next thing you know, you got a hose coming out of your chest attached to a piece of luggage. 

JERRY

Kramer, George didn't have a heart attack. 

KRAMER

No? That's good. 

GEORGE

I have to have my tonsils taken out. 

KRAMER

Oh man.. No.. George, we gotta get you outta here. Get out! Right now! They'll kill ya in here. 

JERRY

(Trying to calm George down) It's routine surgery. 

KRAMER

Oh yeah? My friend, Bob Saccomanno, he came in here for a hernia operation.. Oh yeah, routine surgery.. now he's sittin' around in a chair by a window going, 'My name is Bob' .. George, whatever you do, don't let 'em cut you. Don't let 'em cut you.. 

GEORGE

Well, what should I do, Kramer? 

JERRY

Well, for one think, don't listen to him. 

KRAMER

I'll tell you what to do, I'll tell you what to do. You go to Tor Eckman. Tor, Tor, he'll fix you right up. He's a herbalist, a healer, George. He's not just gonna fix the tonsils and the adenoids, he is gonna change the whole way you function - body and mind. 

JERRY

Eckman? I thought he was doing time? 

KRAMER

No, no, he's out. He got out. See, the medical establishment, see, they tried to frame him. It's all politics. But he's a rebel. 

JERRY

A rebel? No. Johnny Yuma was a rebel. Eckman is a nut. George, you want to take care of your tonsils, you do it in a hospital. With a doctor. 

KRAMER

He's holistic, George. He's holistic. 

GEORGE

Holistic.. that sounds right. 

JERRY

George, you need a medical doctor. 

GEORGE

(To Jerry) Let me ask you something.. How much do you think it would cost to have tonsils and adenoids removed in the hospital? 

JERRY

Well, an overnight stay in a hospital? Minor surgery? I dunno, four grand. 

GEORGE

Uh-huh. And how much does the healer charge? 

KRAMER

First visit? Thirty-eight bucks. 

GEORGE

Oh, yeah? Holistic.. that's what I need. That's the answer. 

GEORGE

So, how do you like the way I talked you into comin' down here? 

JERRY

Don't flatter yourself, my friend. I'm here strictly for material, and I have a feeling this is a potential gold mine.. I still think you're nuts, though. 

GEORGE

All I know is I've been going to doctors all my life. What has it gotten me? I'm thirty-three years old. I haven't outgrown the problems of puberty, I'm already facing the problems of old age. I completely skipped healthy adulthood. I went from having orgasms immediately to taking forever. You could do your taxes in the time it takes me to have an orgasm. I've never had a normal, medium orgasm. 

JERRY

(Jokingly making fun of George) I've never had a really good pickle. 

GEORGE

Besides, what's it gonna cost me? Thirty-eight bucks? 

TOR

(To Jerry) Would you not put your foot on that please? 

JERRY

Sorry. 

TOR

What month were you born? 

GEORGE

April. 

TOR

You should have been born in August. Your parents would have been well-advised to wait. 

GEORGE

Really? 

TOR

Do you use hot water in the shower? 

GEORGE

Yes. 

TOR

Stop using it. 

GEORGE

..Okay. 

KRAMER

I'm off hot water. 

TOR

Kramer tells me that you are interested in an alternative to surgery. 

GEORGE

Yes, yes I am. 

TOR

(Blows into George's face) I think we can help you. See, unfortunately, the medical establishment is a business like any other business. And business needs customers. And, they want to sell you their most expensive item which is unnecessary surgery. 

GEORGE

(Still on the showers) Can I use hot water on my face? 

TOR

No. You know, I am not a business man. I'm a holistic healer. It's a calling, it's a gift. You see, it's in the best interest of the medical profession that you remain sick. You see, that insures good business. You're not a patient. You're a customer. 

JERRY

(He thinks this, the audience can hear his thoughts) And you're not a doctor, but you play one in real life. 

GEORGE

(Still on the hot water) What about shaving? 

TOR

(To Jerry) You're eating too much dairy. (To George) May I? (Reaches over, and touches George's face) 

GEORGE

I guess so. 

TOR

(Feeling George's face) You see, you are in disharmony. The throat is the gateway to the lung. Tonsillitis, adenoiditis, is, in Chinese medical terms, and invasion of heat and wind. 

JERRY

(Again, we hear his thoughts) There's some hot air blowing in here.. 

TOR

You know, I lived with the Eskimos many years ago, and they used to plunge their faces into the snow. 

GEORGE

(Once again, still on the shower) Could it be lukewarm? 

JERRY

Too much dairy? You really think I'm eating too much dairy? 

DOCTOR

..The tongue.. yes, the tongue.. or, in medical terms, the glossa. It's a muscular organ.. Consists of two parts.. the body, and the root.. You see, it's covered by this mucous membrane.. These little raised projections are the papillae, which give it that furry appearance. Very tactile.. 

ELAINE

Uh-huh. 

TOR

(Pouring tea) Your tea is ready now. This will solve your so-called tonsil problem. It's a special concoction. It contains crampbark. 

JERRY

I love crampbark. 

TOR

Cleavers. 

JERRY

Cleaver, I once had cleaver as a kid. I was able to lift a car. 

TOR

And some couchgrass. 

JERRY

Couchgrass and crampbark? You know, I think that's what killed Curly. 

KRAMER

Go ahead, drink it, George. 

JERRY

Excuse me, Tor. May I ask you a question? You have intuitive abilities. You're in touch with a lot of this cosmic kind of things.. I have this note I can't read. I was wondering if- 

TOR

(Takes the note, then laughs when he reads it) Oh, yes.. yes.. 'Cleveland 117, San Antonio 109.. (Hands note back to Jerry) 

KRAMER

Go ahead, drink it, George. 

GEORGE

(Takes a sip) Hey, it's not too bad.. 

GEORGE

(In a state of hysteria) I'm an eggplant! I'm an eggplant! I'm a minstrel man! 

DRIVER

(To Assistant) I didn't take your Chuckle, man! 

ASSISTANT

I had five Chuckles. I ate a green one, and the yellow one, and the red one is missing! 

DRIVER

I don't even like Chuckles! 

JERRY

(To Assistant) Maybe he doesn't like them. That's possible. 

GEORGE

My face! My face! Get me to the hospital! 

ASSISTANT

I want that Chuckle! You hear me?! 

JERRY

(To Assistant) I'll get you a Chuckle. You want me to get you a Chuckle? 

ASSISTANT

(Angry, to Driver) Pull over! 

DRIVER

Pull over? Did you say pull over?! You want a piece of me?! 

ASSISTANT

Yeah! 

JERRY

You're gonna fight? 

GEORGE

Now?! I'm a mutant! 

KRAMER

(To Driver) Hey, let me drive. 

ASSISTANT

Come on, man. Pull over! 

DRIVER

Alright! I'm gonna mess you up, man! 

JERRY

(Pleading) Really, gentlemen, please. 

GEORGE

My heart! My heart! (To Assistant) Where you going? Are you crazy?! 

ASSISTANT

I'm gonna kick his ass. 

KRAMER

(To Assistant) Hey, you have keys? 

GEORGE

You can't leave! This is an ambulance! This is an emergency! 

JERRY

All this for a Chuckle. 

KRAMER

What's a Chuckle? 

JERRY

It's a jelly candy. it comes in five flavors. 

DOCTOR

You see, taste buds run on grooves along the surfaces. 

ELAINE

Can you let go of my tongue now? 

DOCTOR

What? 

ELAINE

Let go of my tongue! 

DOCTOR

(Lets go) Oh, sorry. 

ELAINE

Well, I should get going.. (The Doctor leans in for a kiss. Elaine stops him) What are you doing? 

DOCTOR

I was going to kiss you good night. 

ELAINE

A kiss? With the tongue? The glossa with the bumps and the papillae? ..Yech, I don't think so. (Leaves) 

JERRY

You just can't leave him out there. 

DRIVER

I told him I was gonna mess him up. 

KRAMER

Well, can you call him an ambulance? 

DRIVER

I told him I didn't take his Chuckle. I don't eat that gooey crap! 

KRAMER

hey, watch the road! Watch the road, man! 

DRIVER

(Turns back, facing Kramer) Hey, man, you want some of what he got?! 

KRAMER

Watch out! 

JERRY

How ya doing? (George nods) Can't talk? (George shakes his head. Jerry gestures to his brace) Hey, how'd you get the plastic one? (George raises his eyebrows) I like that. (George sticks his tongue out) So how's life without tonsils? (George quickly indicates with his arm that he wants ice cream) What? What's that? ..So, how much is this thing gonna cost you now? Like, five, six thousand?.. (George signals that it's more) Well, live and learn.. at least we lived. Kramer went to Eckman.. He feels better alreadyy.. (George motions for ice cream again) What are you doing? 

ELAINE

Oh, poor George. Oh, I'm sorry, but I can't stay long. I don't want to run into Doctor Tongue.. Here, I brought you something. (Takes out a pint of ice cream. George gets excited) Oh, please, come on.. it was nothing. 

JERRY

Hey, check the TV. 

VOICE

(Germanic) It's just as you prophesied. The planets of our solar system, incinerating. Like flaming globes, Sigmond. Like flaming globes. Ah, ha, ha, ha.. 

JERRY

(Pulls the note out of his pocket) That's it! That's it! Flaming globes of Sigmond! Flaming Globes of Sigmond! That's my note! tha'ts what I thought was so funny?! ..That's not funny.. There's nothing funny about that. 

BED

Shut up! 

MAN

Aaahhhgggg! 

JERRY

I have a friend who's a hypochondriac, always thinks he's sick - never is. And they, you have another type of person, always thinks they're well, not matter how bad they really are. You know this type of person? Very annoying. 'Feel great.. like being on the respirator.. intravenous heart/lung machine. I never felt better in my life.' Medical science is making advances every day in control health problems. In fact, it's probably only a matter of time before a heart attack, you know, becomes like, a head ache. We'll just see people on TV going, 'I had a heart attack this big (Holds out hands, gesturing bigness) ..but, I gave myself one of these. Clear! (Puts imaginary electrode panels to his chest) Brrhht.. and it's gone!' 

JERRY

What are you doing? All right, all right. What's the matter with that? What about that one? 

ELAINE

Robert Vaughn, The Helsinki Formula? 

JERRY

He was good in Man From Uncle. 

ELAINE

Guess whose birthday's comin' up soon? 

JERRY

I know, I'm having my root canal the same week. 

ELAINE

Oh, right. I hope you have a good oral surgeon because that can be very serious. (Changes channel) Hey, look at naked people. 

JERRY

No, I don't wanna see the naked people. 

ELAINE

Been a while? 

JERRY

I have a vague recollection of doing something with someone, but it was a long, long time ago. 

ELAINE

I think my last time was in Rochester. My hair was a lot shorter. 

JERRY

I remember that it's a good thing. Someday, I hope to do it again. (Jerry looks at Elaine) 

ELAINE

What? 

JERRY

What? 

ELAINE

What was that look? 

JERRY

What look? 

ELAINE

The look you just gave me. 

JERRY

I gave a look? 

ELAINE

Yes. 

JERRY

What kind of look? 

ELAINE

I know that look. 

JERRY

Then what was it? 

ELAINE

Why should I tell you? 

JERRY

Well, you're the big look expert. I wanna see how smart you are. 

ELAINE

Trust me. I know the look. (Pause) So... 

JERRY

What? 

ELAINE

What about the look? 

JERRY

I don't know. 

ELAINE

You got something on your mind? 

JERRY

No. Things pop into your head. You? 

ELAINE

Things occur to me from time to time. 

JERRY

Yeah, me too. Well, you can't expect to just forget the past completely. 

ELAINE

No, of course not. 

JERRY

I mean, it was something we did. Probably about, what? Twenty-five times? 

ELAINE

Thirty-seven. 

JERRY

Yeah, we pretty much know what we're doin' in there. (Points to bedroom) 

ELAINE

We know the terrain. 

JERRY

No big surprises. 

ELAINE

Nope. 

JERRY

What do you think? 

ELAINE

I don't know. What do you think? 

JERRY

Well, it's something to consider. 

ELAINE

Yeah. 

JERRY

I mean, let's say we did. 

ELAINE

What if. 

JERRY

Is that like the end of the world or something? 

ELAINE

Certainly not. 

JERRY

Why shouldn't we be able to do that once in a while if we want to? 

ELAINE

I know. 

JERRY

I mean, really, what is the big deal? We go in there. (Points to the bedroom) We're in there for a while. We come right back out here. It's not complicated. 

ELAINE

It's almost stupid if we didn't. 

JERRY

It's moronic. 

ELAINE

Absurd! 

JERRY

Of course, I guess, maybe, some little problems could arise. 

ELAINE

We, there are always a few. 

JERRY

I mean, if anything happened, and we couldn't be friends the way we are now, that would be really bad. 

ELAINE

Devastating. 

JERRY

Because this is very good. (Points back and forth between them to indicate friendship) 

ELAINE

And that would be good. (Points to bedroom) 

JERRY

That would be good too. The idea is combine the this and the that. But this cannot be disturbed. 

ELAINE

Yeah, we just wanna take this and add that. 

JERRY

But of course, we'd have to figure out a way to avoid the things that cause the little problems. Maybe some rules or something. 

ELAINE

Huh. 

JERRY

For example, now, I call you whenever I'm inclined and vice versa. 

ELAINE

Right. 

JERRY

But if we did that, we might feel a certain obligation to call. 

ELAINE

Well why should that be? Oh, I have an idea. I have an idea. No call the day after that. 

JERRY

Beautiful. Let's make it a rule. 

ELAINE

All right, sir. 

JERRY

Now here's another little rule. 

ELAINE

Yeah. 

JERRY

When we see each other now, we retire to our separate quarters. But sometimes, when people get involved with that, they feel pressure to sleep over. When that is not really sleep. Sleep is separate from that. And I don't see why sleep got all tied up and connected with that. 

ELAINE

Okay, okay. Rule Number Two. Spending the night is optional! 

JERRY

Well now we're gettin' somewhere. 

ELAINE

What about the kiss goodnight? 

JERRY

Tough one. You're call. 

ELAINE

It's brug-wa (?). 

JERRY

Fine. Well. 

ELAINE

Well. 

JERRY

You ready? 

ELAINE

Ready. 

JERRY

So think you can handle this? 

ELAINE

Definitely. (Runs into bookshelf) 

KRAMER

Hey. 

JERRY

Hey. 

KRAMER

Got the paper? 

JERRY

Not yet. 

KRAMER

No paper? 

JERRY

I haven't been out yet. 

KRAMER

Well, what's taking you so long? (Elaine enters from the bedroom. Kramer is a little shocked) Uh? Oh, well, yeah... (He exits) 

GEORGE

What's the deal with Aquaman? Could he go on land, or was he just restricted to water? 

JERRY

No, I think I saw him on land a couple times. So how's the job situation goin'? 

GEORGE

Still lookin'. It's pretty bad out there. What about you? 

JERRY

Nothin' much. I slept with Elaine last night. 

GEORGE

Oxygen! I need some oxygen! This is major. 

JERRY

I thought you'd like that. 

GEORGE

Oh, this is huge! 

JERRY

I know. 

GEORGE

All right, okay. Let's go, details. 

JERRY

No, I can't do details. 

GEORGE

You wha? 

JERRY

I can't give details. 

GEORGE

No details? 

JERRY

I'm not in the mood. 

GEORGE

You ask me here to have lunch, tell me you slept with Elaine, and then say you're not in the mood for details. Now you listen to me. I want details and I want them right now. I don't have a job, I have no place to go. You're not in the mood? Well you get in the mood! 

JERRY

All right, okay. We're in the apartment watching TV. 

GEORGE

Where are you sitting? 

JERRY

On the couch. 

GEORGE

Next to each other? 

JERRY

No, separated. 

GEORGE

Time? 

JERRY

Around eleven. 

GEORGE

Okay, go ahead. 

JERRY

So she's flipping around the TV, and she gets to the naked station. 

GEORGE

Oh, see? that's why I don't have cable in my house. Because of that naked station. If I had that in my house, I would never turn it off. I wouldn't sleep, I wouldn't eat. Eventually, firemen would have to break through the door, they'd find me sitting there in my pajamas with drool coming down my face. All right, all right. So you're watching the naked station. 

JERRY

And then, somehow, we started talking about, what if we had sex. 

GEORGE

Boy, these are really bad details. 

JERRY

It pains me to say this, but I may be getting to mature for details. 

GEORGE

Oh I hate to hear this. That kind of growth really irritates me. 

JERRY

Well. I'll tell you though. It was really passionate. 

GEORGE

Better than before? 

JERRY

She must've taken some kind of seminar or something. 

GEORGE

This is all too much. So what are you feeling? What's going on? Are you like a couple again now? 

JERRY

Not exactly. 

GEORGE

Not exactly. What does that mean? 

JERRY

Well, we've tried to arrange a situation where we'll be able to do this once in a while and still be friends. (George laughs hysterically and stands out of his seat) 

GEORGE

Where are you living? Are you here? Are you on this planet? It's impossible. It can't be done. 

JERRY

I think we've worked out a system. 

GEORGE

Oh, you know what you're like? You're like a pathetic gambler. You're one of those losers in Las Vegas who keeps thinking he's gonna come up with a way to win at blackjack. 

JERRY

No, this is very advanced. We've designed at set of rules that we can maintain the friendship by avoiding all of the relationship pitfalls. 

GEORGE

Sure, all right. Tell me the rules. 

JERRY

Okay. No calls the next day. 

GEORGE

(To himself) So you're havin' the sex, next day you don't have to call. That's pretty good. (Back to Jerry) Go ahead. 

JERRY

You ready for the second one? 

GEORGE

I have tell you, I'm pretty impressed with the first one. 

JERRY

Spending the night. Optional. 

GEORGE

No, you see? You got greedy. 

JERRY

No, that's the rule. It's optional. 

GEORGE

I know less about women than anyone in the world. But one thing I do know is they're not happy if you don't spend the night. It could be a hot, sweaty room with no air conditioning and all they have is a little army cot this wide (Displays with French fry) You're not going anywhere. 

JERRY

I think you're wrong. 

GEORGE

I hope I am. 

JERRY

Is this yours or the roommate's? 

ELAINE

The roommate's. 

JERRY

Would she mind? 

ELAINE

She keeps track of everything. 

JERRY

Well, that's too bad, 'cause I'm takin' it. 

ELAINE

Thanks. 

JERRY

Well, guess I'll get going. 

ELAINE

Oh. 

JERRY

Well, I got that root canal tomorrow morning. It'll be easier if I go home. 

ELAINE

Fine, go away. 

JERRY

I don't understand. Is there a problem? (Elaine is pulling a roll of paper towels about twenty feet long) I'm getting the impression there's a problem. 

ELAINE

Just go. 

JERRY

I'm having surgery tomorrow. 

ELAINE

Oh, surgery. You're going to the dentist. 

JERRY

But you said, it can be very serious. 

ELAINE

Okay, so fine. Go. 

JERRY

What happened to the rules? Remember? Sleeping over was optional. 

ELAINE

Yeah, it's my house, it's my option. 

JERRY

It has nothing to do with whose house it is. 

ELAINE

Oh, of course it does. (Elaine's roommate, Tina, enters) 

JERRY

Hi. 

JERRY

Hi. 

ELAINE

Oh really? 

ELAINE

Uh, Tina? Could you excuse us for just one second? 

ELAINE

What are you doing? 

JERRY

I can't go if you're mad. 

ELAINE

I'm not mad. 

JERRY

You seemed a little mad. 

ELAINE

No, no. Jerry, I'm fine really. It's okay. 

JERRY

So you're okay with everything? 

ELAINE

Definitely. Are you? 

JERRY

Definitely. Well, goodnight. 

ELAINE

Goodn-- (He starts to kiss her) What're you doing? 

JERRY

What? 

ELAINE

Rules. 

GEORGE

What about jewelry? That's very nice gift. 

JERRY

No, no. I have to be very careful here. I don't want to send the wrong message. Especially after the other night. 

GEORGE

Maybe I'll get her some jewelry. 

JERRY

No, no. You can't get her anything better than me. Whatever I spend, you have to spend half. 

GEORGE

What am I supposed to get, a bazooka? 

JERRY

You don't understand. I'm in a very delicate position. Whatever I give her, she's going to be bringing in experts from all over the country to interpret the meaning behind it. 

GEORGE

What does she need? Maybe there's something that she needs. 

JERRY

I think I heard her say something about a bench. 

GEORGE

A bench? What kind of a bench? 

JERRY

I don't know, but she mentioned a bench. 

GEORGE

What, like at a bus stop? 

JERRY

I don't know. 

GEORGE

Like a park bench? 

JERRY

I have no idea. 

GEORGE

Who puts a bench in their house? 

JERRY

Forget the bench. 

GEORGE

I got it. You wanna get her something nice? How 'bout a music box? 

JERRY

No, too relationshippy. She opens it up, she hears that Laura's theme, I'm dead. 

GEORGE

Okay, what about a nice frame? With a picture of another guy in it. Frame says I care for you, but if you wanna get serious, perhaps you'd be interested in someone like this. 

JERRY

Nice looking fellow. 

GEORGE

What about candle holders? 

JERRY

Too romantic. 

GEORGE

Lingerie? 

JERRY

Too sexual. 

GEORGE

Waffle maker. 

JERRY

Too domestic. 

GEORGE

Bust of Nelson Rockefeller. 

JERRY

Too Gubernatorial. (?) 

GEORGE

Let's work on the card. 

JERRY

Maybe you won't like it. 

ELAINE

Oh, how could I not like it? Of course I'll like it. 

JERRY

You could not like it. 

ELAINE

Just the fact that you remembered means everything. 

JERRY

Of course I remembered. You reminded me everyday for two months. Oh, the card. (She opens) 

ELAINE

Cash? 

JERRY

Would do you think? 

ELAINE

You got me cash? 

JERRY

Well this way I figure you can go out and get yourself whatever you want. No good? 

ELAINE

Who are you, my uncle? 

JERRY

Well come on. That's $182 right there. I don't think that's anything to sneeze at. 

ELAINE

Let me see the card. (Reading) To a wonderful girl, a great pal, and more? (Kramer enters) 

KRAMER

Hey. Oh, Elaine. I'm glad you're here. Stay right there. I'm gonna be right back. (He exits) 

ELAINE

Pal? You think I'm your pal? 

JERRY

I said, 'and more.' 

ELAINE

I am not your pal. 

JERRY

What's wrong with pal? Why is everyone so down on pal? (Kramer enters with present) 

ELAINE

Oh, what is this? You got me something? 

KRAMER

Yeah. Open it. 

ELAINE

Oh Kramer... (She opens it) The bench! You got me the bench that I wanted! (Jerry looks irritated) 

KRAMER

That's pretty good, huh? 

JERRY

Great. 

KRAMER

Remember when we were standing there and she mentioned it? I made a mental note of it. 

JERRY

Well goody for you. 

KRAMER

Oh yeah, I'm very sensitive about that. I mean, when someone's birthday comes up, I keep my ears open. So what'd you get her? 

JERRY

182 bucks. 

KRAMER

Cash? You gotta be kidding. What kind of gift is that? That's like something her uncle would get her. 

ELAINE

(Reading card) Think where man's glory most begins and ends and say my glory was I had such a friend. 

KRAMER

(To Jerry) Yates. 

ELAINE

Oh Kramer. (They embrace) 

JERRY

Could you excuse us please? 

KRAMER

What? 

JERRY

We're talking. 

KRAMER

Oh, the relationship. (He leaves) 

JERRY

You know, we never had one fight before this deal. 

ELAINE

I know. 

JERRY

Never. 

ELAINE

Ever. 

JERRY

We got along beautifully. 

ELAINE

Like clams. 

JERRY

It was wonderful. 

ELAINE

A pleasure. 

JERRY

So I think we should just forget the whole deal, and go back to being friends. 

ELAINE

I can't do it. 

JERRY

You what? 

ELAINE

I can't do that. 

JERRY

You mean it's... (She nods) No this. No that. No this or that. Oh, boy. Hmmm. What do you want? 

ELAINE

This, that, and the other. 

JERRY

Oh, sure. Of course, you're entitled. Who doesn't want this, that, and the other? 

ELAINE

You. 

JERRY

(Starts to correct then realizes) Well... 

GEORGE

Those birthdays. I told you. They're relationship killers. If a relationship is having any problems whatsoever, a birthday will always bring it out. 

JERRY

I never should have made up those rules. 

GEORGE

What is it about sex that just disrupts everything? Is it the touching? Is it the nudity? 

JERRY

It can't be the nudity. I never got into these terrible fights and misunderstandings when I was changing before gym class. 

GEORGE

You know what this means? I can't see her anymore either. 

JERRY

Why? 

GEORGE

It's break up by association. Besides, she's mad at me anyway because of my birthday present. 

JERRY

What did you end up giving her? 

GEORGE

91 dollars. 

JERRY

Sorry about that. 

GEORGE

So what're you gonna do? 

JERRY

Well, if I call her, there's no joking around anymore. This is pretty much it. 

GEORGE

So, maybe this should be it. 

JERRY

Could be it. 

GEORGE

She seems like an it. 

JERRY

She's at it as you get. Imagine bumping into her on the street in five years with a husband. And she tells me he's a sculptor, they live in Vermont... 

GEORGE

We'd have to kill him. 

JERRY

We'd get caught, I'd get the chair. 

GEORGE

I'd go to prison as your accomplice. I'd have to wear that really heavy denim. Go to the cafeteria line with the guy who slops those mashed potatoes onto your plate. Go to the bathroom in front of hundreds of people. 

JERRY

Plus, you know what else. 

GEORGE

You better call her. 

KRAMER

Hey. 

JERRY

Hey. 

KRAMER

You got the paper yet? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

KRAMER

Well where is it? (Elaine enters from bedroom with newspaper) Hey, you done with that? 

ELAINE

No. 

KRAMER

Well, you're not reading it now. 

ELAINE

All right, you can take it. But I want it back. 

KRAMER

Oh yeah. So, ah, what're you guys gonna do today? 

ELAINE

Ah, this. And that. 

JERRY

And the other. 

KRAMER

Boy, I really liked the two of you much better when you weren't a couple. (He exits) 

GEORGE

(Shocked) She's pregnant? Leslie is pregnant?! Oh, see, there is no justice. 

JERRY

She's the performance artist, right? 

GEORGE

(Sarcastic) Yeah, performance artist. She's a real performer. A real trooper. 

JERRY

What's her husband's name, again? Chip? Kip? Skip? 

ELAINE

Todd. 

JERRY

Todd. Oh yeah. (To George) He's a Kennedy. 

ELAINE

No, he's not. 

JERRY

C'mon. He's a third cousin, or something. 

ELAINE

By marriage. 

JERRY

Oh, by marriage. (To George) We went to their wedding. You should have heard him talking about Chappaquiddick - trying to blame the whole thing on bad directions. 

GEORGE

That woman was unequivocally the worst date of my life. 

ELAINE

Oh, pardon me for trying to set you up with a beautiful, intelligent woman. 

GEORGE

What, you don't think I can attract beautiful, intelligent women? 

JERRY

Thin ice, George. Thin ice.. 

GEORGE

(Sarcastic) Maybe for her new performance piece she'll give birth on stage. 

ELAINE

She stopped performing. 

GEORGE

(Again, sarcastic) Oh, what a huge blow to the culture. 

JERRY

(Gesturing to George) You believe this guy? He holds a grudge like Khomeini. 

GEORGE

She dragged me down to that warehouse on the waterfront in Brooklin to see one of her 'performances'. 

JERRY

Oh, and she cooks dinner onstage for some celebrity? 

GEORGE

God! She's cooking dinner for God! She's yelling and screaming, and the next thing I know, she throws a big can of chocolate syrup all over my new red shirt. 

ELAINE

It was an accident! 

GEORGE

Oh, yeah, sure, accident, right. She was aiming right at me like she was putting out a fire! Then, for the rest of the show, I'm sitting there with chocolate all over my shirt. Flies are landing on me. I'm boiling - I'm fantasizing all the things I'm gonna say when I see her. And later, finally, backstage when I talk to her, I'm a groveling worm. 'What kind of chocolate was that? Do you throw any other foods?' 

JERRY

(To Elaine) he thought he still had a shot. 

GEORGE

And then, then, then she leaves with somebody else! Never even, never even said goodbye! Never called me back.. Never apologized. Nothing. Like I was dirt. 

JERRY

What ever happened with the shirt? 

GEORGE

I still have it. The collar's okay. I wear it under sweaters. 

ELAINE

I don't know what I'm gonna do. She asked me to give her a baby shower. 

JERRY

Asked you? You're not going to do that are you? 

ELAINE

anyone else, never. But, Leslie - I have a problem saying no to. For some reason, I seem to want her approval. 

GEORGE

Let Maria Shriver give her a baby shower. 

JERRY

Ask not what I can do for you - ask what you can do for me. 

GEORGE

(Germanic) Ich bin ein sucker. 

ELAINE

Oh, would you two stop with the Kennedys? Why does everybody make such a big deal about he Kennedys? What is this fascination?! Who cares?! It's all so boring.. 

GEORGE

She doesn't deserve a baby shower. She deserves a baby monsoon. She deserves Rosemary's baby! 

ELAINE

(To Jerry) I do have one teeny little problem, though. 

GEORGE

Never said goodbye. Never apologized. Nothing. 

ELAINE

See, I was gonna give the shower in my apartment.. 

JERRY

But? 

ELAINE

My roommate has Lyme disease. 

JERRY

Lyme disease? I thought she had Epstein-Barr Syndrome? 

ELAINE

She has this in addition to Epstein-Barr. It's like Epstein-Barr with a twist of Lyme disease. 

JERRY

How did she get Lyme disease? 

ELAINE

I don't know. She did some outdoor version of Hair in Danbury, Connecticut. 

JERRY

They still do that play? 

ELAINE

It's a classic. 

JERRY

With all the nudity? 

ELAINE

I guess. She must've rolled over on a tick during the love-in. 

GEORGE

(Still mad a Leslie) Never said goodbye. Goodbye! 

JERRY

Explain to me how this baby shower thing works. 

ELAINE

What do you wanna know? 

JERRY

Well, I mean, does it ever erupt into a drunken orgy of violence? 

ELAINE

Rarely. 

JERRY

There's no hazing of the fetus, or anything, is there? 

ELAINE

No. 

JERRY

When is this suppose to be? 

ELAINE

Saturday. 

JERRY

Saturday?.. Well, I have a show in Buffalo on Saturday. They're not gonna bust up my apartment, or anything, are they? 

ELAINE

I'll take full responsibility. You won't regret it. 

JERRY

'Cause I've seen these pregnant women - and they sometimes misjudge their fetal girth. Just like one wrong turn, and boom! And entire buffet is swept off the table. 

GEORGE

Someday, before I die, mark my words - I'm gonna tell that woman exactly what I think of her. I'll never be able to forgive myself until I do. 

JERRY

And if you do? 

GEORGE

I still won't be able to forgive myself - but at least it won't be about this. 

KRAMER

What are you doing this for? Look at you.. 

JERRY

Quiet. I'm trying to get a picture. 

KRAMER

But you don't have to do this! This guy is waiting in my house. 

JERRY

(Pleading) Leave me alone. 

KRAMER

It's a one-time fee. A hundred and fifty bucks. Why live like this?! 

JERRY

I'm not getting illegal cable! 

KRAMER

Oh, so what are you gonna do? You gonna wait for the cable companies to resolve their dispute? They're gonna be in court for years. 

JERRY

No, I read in the paper.. 

KRAMER

(Sarcastic) Oh, oh, the paper.. 

JERRY

Well, they might hook us up again. 

KRAMER

Oh, God, you're so naive! All the cable companies care about is the 'Big Mammoo.' (Jerry wacks the TV) Oh, look at you! You're banging things.. Pathetic. Just wasting your life. I'm offering you fifty-six channels - movies, sports, nudity. And it's free! For life! 

JERRY

Stop shouting! You're ruining the reception. 

KRAMER

Can you hear yourself? Can, can, do you know what you're saying?! 

JERRY

What you're suggesting is illegal. 

KRAMER

It's not illegal. 

JERRY

It's against the law. 

KRAMER

Well, yeah. 

JERRY

(Gesturing to the rabbit ears) Just, just, hold this. Can you hold that? 

KRAMER

(Holding the rabbit ears) Look, will you at least let me bring the guy over? He's an amazing man. He's a Russian immigrant. He escaped the Gulag. He's like the Sakharov of cable guys.. He'll slow down your gas meter. He sells slugs, Jerry. Slugs for the subway. 

JERRY

A real human rights nut, huh? 

KRAMER

Yeah. He's intense, man. 

JERRY

I don't know. What if I get caught? 

KRAMER

Oh, you're not gonna get caught. Look, let me get him. Man, it's the nineties, it's Hammer time! Come on, just let me get him. 

JERRY

You know, why don't we wait? Because, I'm going out of town tomarrow. 

TABACHNICK

Tomarrow okay. 

KRAMER

No problem. Yeah, you'll have the whole thing installed by the time you get back. 

JERRY

(Mutters to himself) Every time I turn on the TV, sirens are gonna go off. They're gonna track me down like a dog, I know it.. 

KRAMER

No, no, now look now, Jerry, Jerry, it's no risk. I swear. The Mets have seventy-five games on cable this year.. 

JERRY

(Pauses, thinking about what Kramer just said) Put it in. 

KRAMER

You won't regret it. (Jerry mutters some more, Kramer rubs his hands together in anticipation, then starts dancing around with a reluctant Jerry) Jerry's gonna be a cable boy, a cable boy, a cable boy.. 

MAN

Mr. Steinfeld? 

JERRY

Seinfeld. 

MAN

We're with the FBI. You wanna tell us about your cable hook-up? 

JERRY

My cable hook-up? What about it? 

MAN

It's been illegally installed, Mr. Steinfeld. 

JERRY

It has? I've been out of town. How did you know? 

KRAMER

Jerry, I had to tell them. I had to. I had no choice. They were onto the scam from the very beginning. 

MAN

You're in serious trouble, Mr. Steinfeld. 

JERRY

Wait a minute. Wait a minute, hold on! We're just patsies. We're just a couple of users.. We never sold the stuff. What about the Russian guy? The Russian guy is the guy you want. 

TABACHNICK

Mr. Seinfeld, Agent Stone. FBI. Undercover. 

KRAMER

No! Jerry! (The FBI agents open fire. Jerry's gunned down by a hailstorm of bullets. Kramer leans next to a fallen Jerry, cupping Jerry's head in his hands) Cable boy, cable boy.. What have you done to my little cable boy?.. 

JERRY

Excuse me. Can I get something to drink? 

STEWARDESS

I'm afraid not. 

JERRY

What's with this airline? What are you, cutting out the drinks now? 

STEWARDESS

No sir. We're flying into a blizzard. Please fasten your seat belt. We're making an emergency landing. 

JERRY

(Sarcastic) Are they gonna go over the instructions again? 

BILL

My name is Bill. I might be the last person you ever see. 

JERRY

I'm not afraid of flying, although many people do have fear of flying and, I have no arguement with that. I think fear of flying is quite rational because, human beings cannot fly. Humans have fear of flying same way fish have fear of driving. Put a fish behind the wheel, and they go, 'This isn't right. I shouldn't be doing this. I don't belong here.' 

GEORGE

Sounds like a rough trip. 

JERRY

Oh, fire engines, ambulances all along the runway. And then, when we landed safely, they all seemed so disappointed. 

GEORGE

So, the college cancelled the gig? 

JERRY

Well, there was so much snow. The roads were closed. I really appreciate it - you picking me up. Thanks again. 

GEORGE

(Modestly) Forget it. 

JERRY

No, really.. an airport run. 

GEORGE

It's nothing. 

JERRY

Hey, it's one thing if I asked you 'Could you do me a favor?' ..But to suggest it?.. GEORGE: (Obviously up to something. Jerry doesn't suspect anything - yet) Whey you told me what you went through on the plane, it makes you stop and think. You appreciate having a real friend. 

JERRY

(Joking) You know, if Richie Brandes did this, I'd be suspicious, you know. He's always got some ulterior motive. 

GEORGE

(Laughs nervously) ..Ulterior motive. 

JERRY

Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Don't take the bridge.. Get off here. We can't go back to my place, Elaine's having the shower. 

GEORGE

(Obviously knows that, but pretends he doesn't) What, tonight? Now? 

JERRY

Yeah, yeah. I forgot all about it. Alright, it's no big deal. We'll just go back to your place. 

GEORGE

My place? NO, no, no. I hate my place. I don't wanna go back to my place. 

JERRY

You want to get a bite? 

GEORGE

Yeah, I would. It's just, you know, I just ate a whole pot roast. 

JERRY

Well, so what should we do? 

GEORGE

Shouldn't we at least drop off your bag? 

JERRY

Red shirt! Red shirt! That's the red shirt! 

GEORGE

(Nervous) What are you talking about? 

JERRY

You're wearing the chocolate shirt! 

GEORGE

I am? What a strange coincidence.. 

JERRY

A - Ha! Nice try, my friend, but you gotta get up pretty early in the morning.. 

GEORGE

(Pleading) You gotta let me go over there. 

JERRY

What are you gonna do? Badger a pregnant woman at her own baby shower?! What are you, gonna take it off and make her rinse it in club soda? 

GEORGE

No, I'm gonna hold it under her nose so she can smell the scent of stale Bosco that I had to live with for three years, and I'm gonna say, 'Remember this shirt, baby?! Well, now, it's payback time!' 

LESLIE

We just bought an apartment on Riverside Drive. Bernard Goetz's mother used to live there. 

ELAINE

So, where's Todd? 

LESLIE

Up in Hyannisport. 

ELAINE

Oh my God, Hyannisport? With the Kennedys? Who else is up there? Is Rose up there?! 

WOMAN

(To Leslie) So, when's your due date? 

LESLIE

March twentieth, nine a.m. 

WOMAN

You know the time! 

LESLIE

I'm having a planned C-section. My therapist told me if I go through labor, I might get psychotic. 

ELAINE

Leslie, Leslie, whatever happened to Sargent Shriver? Is he still with them? You don't hear much about him these days. Is he out of the loop? 

LESLIE

(Takes a bite of food) Elaine, who catered this, Sears? 

ELAINE

(Whispering to Kramer) What is this?! What are you doing here? 

KRAMER

We're putting in cable. 

ELAINE

The cable? No, no, no. I'm having a party here. You can't do this now! 

KRAMER

Oh, we have to do this now. 

ELAINE

Who's this guy? 

KRAMER

Which one? 

ELAINE

Both of the them. 

KRAMER

Oh, they're Soviet Cable guys. 

ELAINE

Okay.. Does Jerry know about this? 

KRAMER

Oh yeah.. it's all authorized, yeah. 

ELAINE

You can't! You can't do this now! 

KRAMER

Elaine, do you know how booked up this guy is? Now, if I send him away now, it's gonna take Jerry months to get him back.. He won't like that. 

ELAINE

Alright. Just do it fast and then get out. 

KRAMER

(Snaps his fingers) Anatoly! (The Russians get to work on command. To Elaine) Look, it's gonna take a few minutes.. Then, you and the gals can take a load off and watch something on Lifetime. 

JERRY

And what if we go up there? What are you going to say to her? 

GEORGE

(Boiling) What am I going to say?! 

JERRY

Yeah. 

GEORGE

What did you go out with me for?! Just to dump chocolate on my shirt and then just dump me altogether?! I don't deserve that kind of treatment! What, you don't have the common courtesy to return my calls?! To apologize! You think I'm some sort of a loser, that likes to be abused and ignored?! Who's shirt can be ruined without financial restitution?! Some sort of a masochist who enjoys being humiliated? You think you can avoid me like I have some sort of disease?! You have the disease! You have the disease! You may be beautiful and rich and physically .. just .. unbelievable, but you sicken me! You disgust me! You and everyone like you! 

JERRY

You'll never say that to her face. 

GEORGE

Watch me. 

KRAMER

(Flirting with a female guest) Yeah, I eat the whole apple. The core, stem, seeds, everything. 

ELAINE

(To Kramer) Kramer, Kramer, look at him. (Gestures to Tabachnick) Look! He's eating all the food! 

KRAMER

Yeah, yeah. Well, you know, there are many differences between American and Soviet cultures that you're not aware of. See, in Russian, the cable guy, they got the whole run of the house. Yeah, that's tradition. (Turns back to the woman) Did you ever eat the bark of a pineapple? 

ELAINE

Kramer! 

KRAMER

(Trying to break up the fight) Uh.. Excuse me.. 

ELAINE

What are you doing here? I thought you were out of town for the weekend. 

JERRY

The show was cancelled. There was a blizzard. 

ELAINE

I can't believe you told Kramer it's okay to put the cable in during the shower! Jerry, look,, look! They've eaten everything. 

LESLIE

Jerry, what a surprise! I thought you sere out of town. 

JERRY

Well, Leslie, sometimes the road less travelled is less travelled for a reason. 

ELAINE

(Speaking confidentially to George) George, don't even think about it! Don't even dream about it! 

GEORGE

(Unconvincingly coy) About what? 

TABACHNICK

(Sticks his head out the door) Kramer, Kramer, Kramer.. 

GEORGE

Leslie. 

LESLIE

Yeah? 

GEORGE

George.. (She doesn't seem to recognize him) George Costanza. 

LESLIE

Hi. 

GEORGE

(Laughs) You, I guess, you don't remember me.. but we actually, kind of um.. went out.. a couple of years ago.. once.. remember? 

LESLIE

Vaguely. 

GEORGE

You took me to one of your shows.. 

LESLIE

And? 

GEORGE

And, um, it was quite good. In fact, you even incorporated me into the show. I'm not actually a performer. Although, my parents felt I had talent.. 

MARY

Jerry?! (A woman, angry at Jerry, approaches him. Jerry looks confused) Remember me? 

JERRY

I'm sorry, I.. 

MARY

(Livid) Mary Contardi. No? Doesn't ring a bell, Jerry? We had a date, three years ago. You took me to one of your shows. 

JERRY

(Stammering) Oh, I, I, think I remember.. 

MARY

Told me you had a great time! Said you'd call me the next day. 

JERRY

Well, I'm sure I meant to call.. I probably just lost your.. 

MARY

Liar! Liar! You were never going to call me! You thought you could waltz throught the rest of your life and never bump into me again! But you were wrong, Jerry! You were wrong! What do you think, I'm some sort of poor, pathetic wretch?! 

JERRY

No, I don't think that.. 

MARRY

Some person who could be dismissed and ignored?! Some insignificant piece of dust?! Some person who doesn't deserve your respect and your attention?! You're the one that doesn't deserve my respect and my attention! You're the insignificant piece of dust! 

GEORGE

Actually, I never had any formal training. I guess I'd be better suited for improvs, or something.. 

LESLIE

Thanks a lot! 

ELAINE

I'm sorry you have to go. 

WOMAN

Yeah. I really have to be going. 

JERRY

Alright, listen, I've changed my mind about this whole thing. I don't want cable. 

KRAMER

Don't be a fool. 

TABACHNICK

You don't want? 

JERRY

No, I don't want. So, just tell me what I owe you for your trouble.. 

TABACHNICK

(Confers with his assistant, then) Four hundred dollars. 

JERRY

(To Kramer) Four hundred dollars?1 You told me one-fifty! 

LESLIE

I'm going.. obviously. 

ELAINE

Oh, Leslie, I am so sorry about everything that went on here tonight. You know, I had no idea.. 

LESLIE

Elaine, you know, I was watching you tonight, and I realized something. You're just like you were in college. 

ELAINE

(Not sure if it was an insult or a compliment) Oh, thank you. (Leslie leaves. Then Elaine wonders to herself) 'Like you were in college'? 

LESLIE

(Comes back, and yells in the direction of the bedroom) Come on! Let's go! 

GEORGE

(Sheepishly to Elaine) I'll be right back. (Leaves) 

JERRY

(Defiantly) I'm not paying four hundred dollars! I don't even want the thing. What are you going to do?! 

GEORGE

Every woman on the face of the earth has complete control of my life. And yet, I want them all.. is that irony? 

ELAINE

Why can't I meet a Kennedy? ..I saw John Junior once downtown. I was on a bus. I hit the ding, but.. it didn't stop. 

JERRY

Alright, I said I had a good time and I'd call, but who takes that literally? 

KRAMER

(Pops his head into Jerry's apartment) Hey, come on over, Dr. Zhivago's on cable in five minutes.. I'm making popcorn! (Leaves) 

JERRY

What do you do at the end of a date when you know you don't want to see this person ever again, for the rest of your life? What do you say? What do you say? No matter what you say, it's a lie. 'I'll see you around. See you around. If you're around, and I'm around, I'll see you around that area. You'll be around other people. You won't be around me. But you will be around.' 'Take care now.' Did you ever say that to somebody? 'Take care now. Take care, now. Because, I'm not going to be taking care of you. So, you should take care, now.' 'Take care. Take care.' What does this mean? 'Take off!' Isn't that what you really want to say? 'Take off now.' 

ELAINE

No, they've just got to get more cops on the force, it's as simple as that. 

GEORGE

Cops. I don't even care about cops. I wanna see more garbage men. It's much more important. All I wanna see are garbage trucks, garbage cans and garbage men. You're never gonna stop crime, we should at least be clean. 

JERRY

I tell you what they should do, they should combine the two jobs, make it one job, 'cop\garbage man'. I always see cops walking around with nothing to do. Grab a broom! Start sweeping. You sweep sweep sweep... catch a criminal, get right back to sweeping. 

ELAINE

You should run for mayor. 

JERRY

Ehh, nobody listens. 

ELAINE

Where is someone? I'm starving. 

GEORGE

I think this is him right here. 

ELAINE

Is there a table ready? 

MANAGER

How many? 

ELAINE

How many? 

JERRY

Is Tatiana coming? 

GEORGE

I don't know, I have to call her, tell her where we are. I'm very lucky she's even considering seeing me at all. 

JERRY

Really? I thought things were going OK. 

GEORGE

They were, it's kinda complicated. 

JERRY

Well what is it? 

ELAINE

How many? 

JERRY

Ah, alright, four. Seinfeld. 

BRUCE

Four. It'll be five, ten minutes. 

GEORGE

What do you wanna do? 

ELAINE

Let's go someplace else, I am too hungry. 

JERRY

We might as well just stay here, we haven't got that much time if we wanna make it to the movie. 

GEORGE

I gotta call Tatiana. where's the phone? 

JERRY

Tatiana... 

GEORGE

Excuse me, are you gonna be very long? 

BRUCE

Lashbrook, 4! 

JERRY

So did I do a terrible thing? 

ELAINE

You mean lying to your uncle? 

JERRY

I couldn't have dinner with him. 'Plan 9 from Outer Space', one night only, the big screen. My hands are tied! 

GEORGE

You know it's a public phone, you're not supposed to just chit-chat. 

ELAINE

Jerry, get menus so when we sit down we can order right away. 

JERRY

Can't look at a menu now, I gotta be at the table. 

GEORGE

He knows I'm waiting. He sees me. He just doesn't wanna look. 

ELAINE

Everything's gotta be just so with you, doesn't it? 

JERRY

Hey, I offered you those cookies in my house. 

ELAINE

Health cookies. I hate those little dustboard fructose things. 

GEORGE

I just can't believe at the way people are. What is it with humanity? What kind of a world do we live in? 

ELAINE

What? 

JERRY

There's a woman over there that looks really familiar. Dark hair, striped shirt? 

ELAINE

I've never seen her before. 

JERRY

I know this woman. This is gonna drive me crazy. 

MAN

Oh, Excuse me. 

ELAINE

I'm sorry. 

ELAINE

Didja see that? Those people, look, they're getting a table. 

JERRY

Well maybe they were here from before. 

ELAINE

No no no, they weren't here before. 

GEORGE

Excuse me, are you going to be much longer? I have to make a very important call. 

ELAINE

Find out what's going on! 

JERRY

Excuse me, didn't those people just come in? I believe we were ahead of them. 

ELAINE

Yeah. 

BRUCE

What's your name? 

JERRY

Seinfeld. 

BRUCE

No, no, they were here before. Keckitch(sp?), 2! 

ELAINE

Did you ever notice how happy people are when they finally get a table? They think they're so special because they've been chosen. It's enough to make you sick. 

JERRY

Boy, you are really hungry. 

GEORGE

Hey! 

GEORGE

If anything happens here, can I count on you? 

JERRY

What? 

GEORGE

If we decide to go at it. 

JERRY

Yeah, I wanna get into a rumble... 

GEORGE

I have to get in touch with Tatiana! And look at his little outfit. It's all so coordinated, the way his socks matching to his shirt. I really hate this guy. 

ELAINE

I'm gonna faint... 

JERRY

George, who is that woman in the stripes? 

GEORGE

I don't know her. 

JERRY

She looks so familiar. 

ELAINE

Ya know, its not fair people are seated First Come First Served, It should be based on who's hungriest. I feel like just going over there and taking some food off somebody's plate. 

JERRY

I'll tell you what, there's 50 bucks in it for you if you do it. 

ELAINE

What do you mean? 

JERRY

You walk over that table, you pick up an eggroll, you don't say anything, you eat it, say 'thank you very much', wipe your mouth, walk away- I give you 50 bucks. 

GEORGE

What are they gonna do? 

JERRY

They won't do anything; in fact, you'll be giving them a story to tell for the rest of their lives. 

ELAINE

50 bucks, you'll give me 50 bucks? 

JERRY

50 bucks. That table over there, the three couples. 

ELAINE

OK, I don't wanna go over there and do it, and then come back here and find out there was some little loophole, like I didn't put mustard on it or something... 

JERRY

No, no tricks. 

ELAINE

Should I do it, George? 

GEORGE

For 50 bucks? I'd put my face in the soup and blow. 

ELAINE

Alright, alright. Here, hold this. I'm doin' it. 

ELAINE

I know this sounds crazy, but the two men who are standing behind me are going to give me 50 bucks if I stand here and eat one of your eggrolls. 

ELAINE

I'll give you 25 if you let me do it. 

TABLE

What? What is she talking about? What did she say? 

JERRY

What happened? 

ELAINE

Did you see that? 

GEORGE

What were you doing? 

ELAINE

I offered them 25, they had no idea... 

JERRY

George, the phone's free. 

GEORGE

Alleluia. 

GEORGE

Excuse me, I was waiting here. 

PHONE

Where? I didn't see you. 

GEORGE

I've been standing here for the last ten minutes! 

WOMAN

Well I won't be long. 

GEORGE

That's not the point. The point is I was here first. 

WOMAN

Well if you were here first, you'd be holding the phone. 

GEORGE

You know, we're living in a society! We're supposed to act in a civilized way. 

GEORGE

Does she care? No. Does anyone ever display the slightest sensitivity over the problems of a fellow individual? No. No. A resounding no! 

GUY

Hey, sorry I took so long. 

GEORGE

Oh that's OK, really, don't worry about it. 

ELAINE

How do people fast? Did Ghandi get this crazy? I'm gonna walk around, see what dishes look good. 

JERRY

I told my uncle I had a stomach ache tonight. You think he bought that? 

GEORGE

Yeah, well, he probably bought it. 

JERRY

So what happened with Tatiana? 

GEORGE

I shouldn't even tell you this. 

JERRY

Come on... 

GEORGE

Well, after dinner last week, she invites me back to her apartment. 

JERRY

I'm with you. 

GEORGE

Well, it's this little place with this little bathroom. It's like right there, you know, it's not even down a little hall or off in an alcove. You understand? There's no... buffer zone. So, we start to fool around, and it's the first time, and it's early in the going. And I begin to perceive this impending... intestinal requirement, whose needs are going to surpass by great lengths anything in the sexual realm. So I know I'm gonna have to stop. And as this is happening I'm thinking, even if I can somehow manage to momentarily... extricate myself from the proceedings and relieve this unstoppable force, I know that that bathroom is not gonna provide me with the privacy that I know I'm going to need... 

JERRY

This could only happen to you. 

GEORGE

So I finally stop and say, 'Tatiana, I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but I think it would be best if I left'. 

JERRY

You said this to her after. 

GEORGE

No. During. 

JERRY

Oh, boy. 

GEORGE

Yeah. 

JERRY

Wow! So...? 

GEORGE

So I'm dressing and she's staring up at me, struggling to compute this unprecedented turn of events. I don't know what to say to reassure this woman, and worst of all, I don't have the time to say it. The only excuse she might possibly have accepted is if I told her I am in reality Batman, and I'm very sorry, I just saw the Bat-Signal. It took me 3 days of phone calls to get her to agree to see me again. Now she's waiting for me to call her, and she's 

ELAINE

I hate this place. I don't know why we came here, I'm never coming back here again. 

JERRY

Who is that woman?! 

ELAINE

Remember when you first went out to eat with your parents? Remember, it was such a treat to go and they serve you this different food that you never saw before, and they put it in front of you, and it is such a delicious and exciting adventure? And now I just feel like a big sweaty hog waiting for them to fill up the trough. 

GEORGE

She's off. (goes over to the now available public phone) 

ELAINE

Jerry, talk to that guy again. 

JERRY

What am I gonna say? 

ELAINE

Tell him we wanna catch a movie and that we're late. 

COHEN

Hey, what stinks in here? 

COHEN

Well, I've been looking for a better place. 

BRUCE

Better place... Want a table? 

COHEN

No, just bring me a plate and I'll eat here. 

BRUCE

Give him a plate and you eat here... Come on, I give you a table. 

JERRY

Excuse me... we've been waiting here. Now, I KNOW we were ahead of that guy, he just came in. 

BRUCE

Oh no, Mr. Cohen always here. 

ELAINE

He's always here? What does that mean? What does that mean? 

BRUCE

Oh, Mr. Cohen, very nice man. He live on Park Avenue. 

ELAINE

Where am I? Is this a dream? What in God's name is going on here?! 

GEORGE

She's not there. She left. She must've waited and left because those people wouldn't get off the phone. 

JERRY

Didja leave a message? 

GEORGE

Yeah, I told her to call me here and to tell anyone who answers the phone to ask for a balding, stocky man with glasses. I better tell him I'm expecting a call. 

ELAINE

Oh, Jerry, here comes that woman... 

JERRY

Where do I know her? 

LORRAINE

Hello, Jerry! 

JERRY

Heeeeyyyy... How you doin'? 

LORRAINE

How is everything? 

JERRY

Good, good, good... What's goin' on? 

LORRAINE

Oh, working hard. And you? 

JERRY

Oh, you know, working around, same stuff, doing... whatever. 

LORRAINE

You haven't been around in a while. 

JERRY

I know, I know... Well, you know. 

LORRAINE

You should come by. 

JERRY

Definitely. I plan to, I'm not just saying that. 

ELAINE

Hi, I'm Elaine. 

LORRAINE

Lorraine. Catalano. 

JERRY

I'm sorry, Lorraine, this is Elaine... 

LORRAINE

Well it was nice seeing you, Jerry. And nice meeting you. (she leaves) 

ELAINE

Oh, nice to meet you too, Lorraine! 

JERRY

Oh my god, Lorraine... that's Lorraine from my uncle's office. I'm in big, big trouble. 

ELAINE

The one you broke the plans with tonight? 

JERRY

Yeah, she works in his office. Now she's gonna see him tomorrow and tell him she saw me here tonight. He's gonna tell his wife, his wife's gonna call my mother. Oh, this is bad, you don't know, the chain reaction of calls this is gonna set off. New York, Long Island, Florida, it's like the Bermuda Triangle. Unfortunately, nobody ever disappears. My uncle to my aunt, my aunt to my mother, my mother to my uncle... 

JERRY

...My uncle to my cousin, my cousin to my sister, my sister to me. 

ELAINE

You should've just had dinner with your uncle tonight and gotten in over with. It's just a movie. 

JERRY

Just a movie?! You don't understand. This isn't 'Plans 1 through 8 from Outer Space', this is 'Plan 9', this is the one that worked. The worst movie ever made! 

JERRY

Hey, I got news for you, if we're making this movie, we gotta get a table immediately. 

ELAINE

Alright, OK. Let's stop fooling around. Let's just slip him some money. 

JERRY

In a Chinese restaurant? Do they take money? 

ELAINE

Do they take money? Everyone takes money. I used to go out with a guy who did it all the time, you just slip him 20 bucks. 

GEORGE

20 bucks? Isn't that excessive? 

ELAINE

Well what do you want to give him, change? 

GEORGE

It's more than the meal! 

JERRY

Oh, come on, We'll divide it up three ways. 

GEORGE

Alright. 7,7, (points at himself) 6. I'm not gonna eat that much! 

JERRY

I'm counting your shrimps. OK, Who's gonna do it? 

GEORGE

Oh no, I can't do it. I-I'm not good at these things, I get flustered. Once I tried to bribe an usher at the roller derby, I almost got arrested. 

ELAINE

I guess it's you, Jer. 

JERRY

Me? What about you? 

ELAINE

Oh, I can't do that, it's a guy thing. 

JERRY

The woman's movement just can't seem to make any progress in the world of bribery, can they? 

ELAINE

Give me the money. 

ELAINE

How's it going'? 

BRUCE

Very busy. 

ELAINE

Boy, we are REALLY anxious to sit down. 

BRUCE

Very good specials tonight. 

ELAINE

If there's anything you can do to get us a table we'd really appreciate it. 

BRUCE

What is your name? (he turns the page over the money) 

ELAINE

No no, I want to eat now! (she gets the money from under the page) 

BRUCE

Yes, we have sea-bass dinner tonight, very fresh. 

ELAINE

Here, take this. I'm starving. Take it! Take it! 

BRUCE

Dennison, 4! (goes over to 4 ladies) Your table is ready. 

ELAINE

No no, no, I want that table. I want that table! Oh, come on, did you see that? What was that? He took the money, he didn't give us a table. 

JERRY

You lost the 20. 

ELAINE

Well, how could he do that? 

GEORGE

You didn't make it clear. 

ELAINE

Make it clear? 

JERRY

What a sorry exhibition that was. Alright, let me get the money back. 

BRUCE

Your name? 

JERRY

Seinfeld. 

BRUCE

Yeah, Seinfeld 4! 

JERRY

No no no, you see the girl there, with the long hair? 

BRUCE

Oh yes, yes. Very beautiful girl, very beautiful. Is your girlfriend? 

JERRY

Well, actually, we did date for a while, but... it's really not relevant here. 

BRUCE

Relationships are difficult. It's very hard to stay together- 

JERRY

Alright, listen, alright. How much longer is it gonna be? 

BRUCE

Oh. In about five, ten minutes. 

GEORGE

So? 

JERRY

There seems to be a bit of a discrepancy. 

ELAINE

So when are we gonna eat? 

JERRY

Five, ten minutes. 

GEORGE

We should have left earlier. I told you. 

JERRY

I don't see any way we can eat and make this movie. 

ELAINE

Oh, well I have to eat. 

JERRY

Well let's just order to go, we'll eat it in the cab. 

ELAINE

Eat it in the cab? Chinese food in a cab? 

JERRY

We'll eat it in the movie. 

ELAINE

Oh, who do you think you're going? Do you think that they have big picnic tables there? 

JERRY

Well what do you suggest? 

ELAINE

I say we leave now, we go to 'Skyburger' and we scarf 'em down. 

JERRY

I'm not going to 'Skyburger'. Besides, it's in the opposite direction, let's just eat popcorn or something. 

BRUCE

Cartwright? 

ELAINE

I can't have popcorn for dinner! 

BRUCE

Cartwright? 

ELAINE

I have to eat! 

JERRY

So they have hotdogs there. 

ELAINE

Oh, movie hotdogs! I rather lick the food off the floor. 

GEORGE

I can't go anywhere, I have to wait here for Tatiana's call. Let me just check. 

GEORGE

Excuse me, I'm expecting a call. Costanza? 

BRUCE

Yeah, I just got a call. I yell 'Cartwright! Cartwright!', just like that. Nobody came up, I hang up. 

GEORGE

Well, was it for Costanza or... 

BRUCE

Yes, yes, that's it. Nobody answered. 

GEORGE

Well was it a woman? 

BRUCE

Yeah, yeah. I tell her you not here, she said curse word, I hang up. 

GEORGE

She called. He yelled Cartwright. I missed her. 

JERRY

Who's Cartwright? 

GEORGE

I'm Cartwright! 

JERRY

You're not Cartwri- 

GEORGE

Of course I'm not Cartwright! Look, why don't you two just go to the movies all by yourselves, I'm not in the mood. 

ELAINE

Well me neither, I'm goin' to 'Skyburger'. 

JERRY

So You're not going? 

ELAINE

You don't need us. 

JERRY

Well I can't go to a bad movie by myself. Who am I gonna make sarcastic remarks to, strangers? Eh, I guess I'll just go to my uncle's. 

GEORGE

Should we tell him we're leaving? 

ELAINE

What for? Let's just get out of here. 

BRUCE

Seinfeld, 4? 

JERRY

Hunger will make people do amazing things. I mean, the proof of that is cannibalism. Cannibalism, what do they say, I mean, they're eating and, you know, 'This is good, who is this? I like this person'. You know, I mean, I would think the hardest thing about being a cannibal is trying to get some very deep sleep, you know what I mean? I would think, you'd be like, (pretending to wake up) 'Who is that? Who's there? Who's there? Is somebody there? What do you want? What do you want? You look hungry, are you hungry? Get out of here!' 

ELAINE

Do you want some of mine? 

JERRY

Take some of mine. 

GEORGE

Why do I get pesto? Why do I think I'll like it? I keep trying to like it, like I have to like it. 

JERRY

Who said you have to like it? 

GEORGE

Everybody likes pesto. You walk into a restaurant, that's all you hear - pesto, pesto, pesto. 

JERRY

I don't like pesto. 

GEORGE

Where was pesto 10 years ago? 

JERRY

(Gesturing to a man) Look at that guy. (Elaine starts to look, but Jerry stops her) I'll bet you he's gettin' hair transplants. Any time you see a guy that age wearing a baseball cap, ten to one - plugs. 

ELAINE

(Elaine turns to look at the man, trying to make it sound like they aren't talking about him) The thing about that painting.. is with the colors and um.. (Turns back to Jerry) Oh yeah, plugola. 

JERRY

(To Elaine) Oh, one more thing about the car. Let it warm up for a minute. 

GEORGE

That's a tough minute. It's like waiting in the shower for the conditioner to work. 

JERRY

I don't understand why he couldn't take a cab. 

GEORGE

Who? 

JERRY

Elaine is having a 'houseguest.' She's picking him up at the airport tonight. 

GEORGE

A guy? 

ELAINE

(Slightly embarrassed) Yes, a guy. 

JERRY

He's from a.. Yakima, right? 

ELAINE

Seattle. 

JERRY

Everybody's moving to Seattle. 

GEORGE

It's the pesto of cities. So..? 

ELAINE

(To Jerry) You tell him. 

JERRY

Well, from what I can piece together, our friend here met a gentleman. 

ELAINE

Ed. 

JERRY

Who was in town on a business venture, and um.. 

ELAINE

..We shared an interpersonal experience. (George hits his glass with his fork. To Jerry) Go on. 

JERRY

So they went out a few times, but apparently, when the fellow returned home, he discovered that the Benes tattoo does not wash off so easily. 

ELAINE

On some people. 

GEORGE

Oooh. 

JERRY

So, he's coming in to stay with her for a week. 

ELAINE

It was just gonna be a weekend, but then somehow it became a week. 

MANAGER

What happened? 

GEORGE

Oh, the busboy left the menu a little close to the candle. 

MANAGER

Sorry to the disturbance. 

ELAINE

(Joking, she snobbishly says) I'm never eating here again. 

JERRY

(Pats George on the back) Nice going. Thank you, that ought to get us a free dessert.. (They can see the manager chewing the busboy out from the dining room doorway) I think the busboy's in trouble. 

GEORGE

Did I get him in trouble? Because of what I said?! I just told him what happened.. he didn't do it on purpose.. (Mangager and busboy are arguing. The busboy points in the direction of George) He pointed at me. Why did he point at me?! 

ELAINE

I said I would never eat here again.. But, I, I.. he had to know I was kidding. 

JERRY

(Casually buttering a roll, like he's the innocent one) I didn't say anything. 

GEORGE

I can't believe it. He's going! He's fired! 

ELAINE

Oh, I said it in a kidding way. 

GEORGE

I didn't know he'd get fired. 

JERRY

(Jokingly trying to put more pressure on Elaine and George) He'll probably kill his family over this. 

GEORGE

What if he's waiting for me outside? He pointed at me! Did you see him point?! 

JERRY

(Again, joking) A lot of ex-cons become busboys. They seem to gravitate twards 'em. 

GEORGE

Was it my fault? 

ELAINE

Was it my fault? 

JERRY

(Doesn't have a care in the world) ..Maybe I'll try that pesto. 

JERRY

Look, I feel bad for him too, but he'll get another job. I mean, let's face it, it's not a profession where you embellish your resume and undergo a series of grueling interviews. 

GEORGE

(Eating a sandwich) Oh, like you really know busboys. 

JERRY

Oh, like you do. 

GEORGE

Hey, at least I was a camp waiter. 

JERRY

(Scoffing) Camp. 

GEORGE

It was a fat camp. Those kids depended on me. 

JERRY

Elaine? 

ELAINE

(Through intercom) Yeah. 

JERRY

Busboys are always changing jobs. That's the business. I know. I work with these guys. I tallk to them in the kitchen at the comedy clubs. 

GEORGE

Then why don't you try and get him another job? 

JERRY

I'd love to, but I don't know anything about him. He could be one of those people that walks around the street pricking people with pins. 

ELAINE

I don't know if you people are aware of this, but I am one clever chickadee. 

GEORGE

What? Did you get the busboy's number? 

ELAINE

His phone's been disconnected, but I was able to obtain an address - 1324 Amsterdam Avenue, apartment 4D. (Hands George a card) Now, I did my job. (To Jerry) May I have the car keys, please? 

GEORGE

How did you get all this? 

ELAINE

Does the word 'charm' mean anything to you? 

JERRY

No. (George grabs his jacket) So now you're going to his apartment? I really think this is nuts. 

GEORGE

(Putting his jacket on) I'd like to apologize. I want to tell him I.. I.. didn't mean to get him in trouble. 

JERRY

You, you're going now? 

GEORGE

Yeah, I want to see if there's anything I can do.. maybe get him another job.. maybe I'll hear of something. 

JERRY

Maybe the fat camp. (To Elaine) You're not going? 

ELAINE

I would, but I have to pick up Ed at the airport. 

JERRY

I just don't think you should go alone. Can't you wait till after my set? 

GEORGE

It'll take to long. 

JERRY

Take the K-man. A little support.. 

GEORGE

(Unsure) I don't a.. 

KRAMER

Take me where? Where? 

GEORGE

Look, I really appreciate your coming, but if you wouldn't mind - try not to say too much. 

KRAMER

What am I gonna say? 

GEORGE

I don't know. 

KRAMER

Well, I'm not an idiot. 

GEORGE

Certainly not. 

KRAMER

Then we're cool. 

GEORGE

Yeah.. yeah, we're - we're cool. (Knocks lightly. Kramer takes charge by knocking on the door louder. The busboy answers) Uh, I'm sorry to bother you, I was in the restaurant earlier and I was wondering if I could talk to you for a few minutes about what happened. (He gestures for them to come in. They obey) I hope I'm not interrupting anything. It's just that I think I may have - without realizing it - been responsible for getting you fired. (Nervously laughs) And.. and.. and I just want you to know that I didn't intend for that to happen. 

KRAMER

(Patting George on the shoulder) He's a hell of a guy. 

GEORGE

This is a guy I know.. Kramer. 

KRAMER

&iquest;Habla espanol? 

GEORGE

(To himself) Oh my God. 

ANTONIO

Si. 

KRAMER

&iquest;Como se dice.. waterbed? 

GEORGE

(Interrupting) Anyway, I just wanted to let you know I'm really sorry that happened, and if I can help out in any way, I'll certainly be glad to do that. (Pause) Well, I guess that's about it. 

KRAMER

You got anything to drink? &iquest;Agua? 

GEORGE

Oy uy uy.. (Antonio points to the sink) We really should get going. 

KRAMER

Let me get a glass of water. (Heads tward the sink) 

GEORGE

Hurry up. 

ANTONIO

(Notices that his cat is missing) Pequita? Pequita? (Starts to panic) 

KRAMER

His cat's gone. 

ANTONIO

(Notes the door was left wide open) La puerta esta abierta. (Starts screaming) La puerta esta abierta! (To Kramer and George) Who left the door open? (Silence) Who left the door open?! (Kramer and George look at eachother) Come on, come on! Help me look! (All three head out the door to look) 

KRAMER

..You know, cats run away all the time. You know, my aunt, she had a cat. Ran away. Showed up three years later.. you never know. They got things in 

GEORGE

(Gestures for Kramer to shut up) Once again, Antonio, I can't even begin to say how deeply, deeply sorry I am about everything. The job, the cat.. (A lamp breaks) the lamp. 

KRAMER

The wire was sticking out.. (Fits the two broken pieces together) Yeah. 

GEORGE

(Hands Antonio a card) Here's my card. I'm in real estate, so, if you're ever looking for something bigger, something nicer.. (Antonio is staring at him, angered) ..maybe not right now. Anyway.. (Extends his hand for a handshake. Antonio doesn't move) 

KRAMER

You oughta get that wire fixed. (They go to leave) I got the door. (Shuts the door, the broken lamp falls to the floor) 

JERRY

(On the phone) George, stop worrying about this guy. It wasn't your fault.. Come on, he's not stalking you. 

KRAMER

Hey. 

JERRY

(To Kramer) Hey. (To George) He doesn't even know where you live.. Who told you to give him your business card?.. (Intercom buzzes) That's Elaine. (Kramer buzzes her in. Jerry talks into the phone) Kramer.. (To Kramer) George wants to know when you want to look for the cat again. 

KRAMER

It's been a week. It's up to the cat now. 

JERRY

(Into phone) Kramer says it's up to the cat now. (To Kramer) It'll be on your conscience. 

KRAMER

Oh? How do you figure? 

JERRY

(Into phone) How do you figure? (To Kramer) 'Cause you're the one who left the door open. 

KRAMER

Why was I in charge of closing the door? 

JERRY

(Into phone) Why was he in charge of closing the door? (Irritated at the phone message relay, to Kramer) 'Cause you came in after him! 

KRAMER

So! 

JERRY

(Into phone) So! (To Kramer - getting even more angry) So, the last person in should close the door! 

KRAMER

Let me talk to him. 

JERRY

(To Kramer) Talk - call him from your house. (Elaine enters. Kramer leaves. To phone) He's calling you now.. okay. (Hangs up) 

ELAINE

Ed's downstairs. CAn I have the car keys? 

JERRY

No hello? 

ELAINE

Got any asprin? (Finds some) Hello. Now, lookit, you guarantee this car will get me to the airport tomarrow? No problems? 

JERRY

Guarantee? ..Hey, it's a car. 

ELAINE

Because if there's even the slightest chance of any problem at all, I don't want to take it - because if I don't get this guy on a plane to Seattle and out of my life, I'm gonna kill him, and everyone who tries to stop me. 

JERRY

(Jokingly asking) So, did you have a nice week together? 

ELAINE

I heard a little ping in the car last time. What was that ping? 

JERRY

There's no ping. Why are you so wacky? 

ELAINE

Jerry, you cannot imagine how much I hate this guy.. and he hasn't even done anything! It's the situation. He's a wonderful guy, but I hate his guts! 

JERRY

So, you two been, uh.. 

ELAIEN

No! I told him I've been having my period for the last five days! I'm sleeping all squished over on the edge of my bed.. But, I've only got fourteen hours to go. Nothing can go wrong now. I think I've taken care of everything. I've confirmed the plane reservation. I've checked the weather.. 

JERRY

What's your airport route? 

ELAINE

I've got it all mapped out - I'm taking the tunnel. 

JERRY

..What about the Van Wyck? 

ELAINE

I spoke to a cab driver. For five bucks, he turned me on to the Rockaway Boulevard shortcut. 

JERRY

Oooh. 

ELAINE

Now, lookit, this plane leaves at 10:15. We're getting up at about eight. That gives us enough time, right? 

JERRY

You still using that old alarm clock? 

ELAIEN

Oh, no, no. I bought a new one today. It's got everything - it's got everything... If you oversleep more than ten minutes, a hand comes out and slaps you in the face. 

JERRY

Flying doesn't make me nervous - driving to the airport can make you very nervous because when you're flying, when you're getting on the plane, if you miss that plane, there's no alternative. On the ground, you have options. You have buses, you have taxis, you have trains. But, when you're taking a flight, if you miss it, that's it. No airline goes, 'Well, you missed the flight, we do have a cannon leaving in about ten minutes. Would you be interested in that? It's not a direct cannon, you have to change cannons after you land.' (Imitates cannon operator) 'I'm sorry, where you goin'? Chicago? (Cranks the cannon) Oh, Dallas? Alright, wait a second.. (Cranks cannon to Dallas) Dallas. That's about Dallas. Texas, anyway. You should hit Texas. Are you ready? Make sure you get out of the net immediately, because we shoot the luggage in right after you.' 

ELAINE

(Trying to wake Ed up) Get up! The alarm clock didn't go off! (Shakes him) It's 9:15! You're gonna miss the plane! It's 9:15! 

ED

9:15? 

ELAINE

Yes! 9:15! 

ED

(Going back to sleep) We'll never make it. I'll leave tomarrow. 

ELAINE

Tomarrow?! Are you crazy? No, now, now! Let's go! (Gets his suitcase from the closet, throws it on the bed, and frantically starts packing) You get dressed! Get dressed! 

ED

Can I shower? 

ELAINE

Shower?! ARe you out of your mind?! 

ED

I gotta shower. I'll feel dirty all day. 

ELAINE

Forget the shower! The shower's out. Move it! Put your clothes on! Put your clothes on! (Pulls out drawers of clothes, turning them over in the suitcase. He walks tward the door) Where are you going? 

ED

The kitchen. 

ELAINE

The kitchen?! 

ED

I've got a bag of cashews in there. 

ELAINE

They're not making it! Let's get your pants on! 

ED

What's the big deal if we don't make it? I'll just go tomarrow or the next day. 

ELAINE

No! You have your ticket! You have to go now! 

ED

I'll never make it. 

ELAINE

Don't say that! 

ED

But it takes forty-five minutes to get there. That'll only leave me five minutes to get to the plane. 

ELAINE

Shut up and pack! 

ED

And what if I don't make the plane? You'll have already left. Then what will I do? 

ELAINE

You're talking too much! 

ED

Where's my sweater? 

ELAINE

What?! 

ED

My brown sweater. 

ELAINE

What? What sweater? 

ED

My brown sweater. 

ELAINE

You didn't bring a brown sweater. 

ED

I brought a brown sweater. 

ELAINE

Here! Here! You want a brown sweater?! (Recahes into one of her drawers, and grabs a brown sweater, then packs it) You got a brown sweater! 

ED

That's not mine. I can't take your sweater. 

ELAINE

It's brown! (Takes clothes still on the hangers, and dumps them into the suitcase) 

ED

What are you doing?! 

ELAINE

NO time for folding.. (Looks around) I think that's it. (Zips up the suitcase) 

ED

My shoes. You packed my shoes. 

ELAINE

Shoes? Shoes?! Shoes?! Shoes weren't invented till the fourth century! People walked around for thousands of years without them! (Puts her coat on over her nightie. He picks up his suitcase, she grabs it from him, then pushes him out of her way) I got this. Let's go! 

JERRY

Anywhere in the city? 

GEORGE

Anywhere in the city - I'll tell you the best public toilet. 

JERRY

Okay.. Fifty-fourth and Sixth? 

GEORGE

Sperry Rand Building. 14th floor, Morgan Apparel. Mention my name - she'll give you the key. 

JERRY

Alright.. Sixty-fifth and Tenth. 

GEORGE

(Scoffs) ARe you kidding? Lincoln Center. Alice Tully Hall, the Met. Magnificent facilities. 

ELAINE

(Slow, as if remember a dream) I never new I could drive like that. I was going faster than I've ever gone before, and yet, it all seemed to be happening in slow motion. I was seeing three and four moves ahead, weaving in and out of lanes like an Olympic skier on a gold metal run. I knew I was challenging the very laws of physics. At Queens Boulevard, I took the shoulder. At Jewel Avenue, I used the median. I had it. I was there.. and then.. I hit the Van Wyck. They say no one's ever beaten the Van Wyck, but gentlemen, I tell you this - I came as close as anyone ever has. And if it hadn't been for that five-car-pile-up on Rockaway Boulevard, that numbskull would be on a plane for Seattle right now instead of looking for a parking space downstairs. 

KRAMER

..The busboy's coming! The busboy's coming! 

GEORGE

The busboy's coming? 

JERRY

You don't mean here? 

KRAMER

Yeah. I just buzzed him in. He's on his way up.. 

GEORGE

He's coming up?! (Moves to the door) I'll check you out later. 

JERRY

Where are you going? 

GEORGE

I'm the one he wants! He's coming to settle the score. 

JERRY

(Trying to get George and Kramer out) No. You three all know each other. There's no point in me getting involved at this stage of the game. 

KRAMER

No, he's not going to do anything. I guarantee it. 

GEORGE

Oh, the hell with it. Let him kill me. I.. 

KRAMER

Antonio. In here! 

GEORGE

(Nervous, his voice cracks) Hey, Antonio. How's it going? 

ANTONIO

Three nights ago, a gas main beneath the restaurant exploded, killing five people in my section, including the busboy who replaced me. If I am not fired that night because of you and your thoughtless, stupid, insensitive remarks, it would have been me. You saved my life. (Hugs him again) 

GEORGE

(Trying to be modest) Ah, come on.. 

ELAINE

(Into the intercom) Yeah? 

ED

It's Eddie. 

ELAINE

He's coming up. (Buzzes him in) He's coming up.. 

ANTONIO

And that very same night of the accident, while looking for Pequita, I found a job in a restaurant where they pay me almost twice what I was making before - and when I returned to the apartment, Pequita, perhaps frightened from the explosion, had miraculously returned. Well, but now, I must go, for today I am starting my new and wonderful job. And I am very late. Thank you, thank you, thank you all. (Leaves) 

ED

Hey, watch were you're going. You almost knocked my head off! 

ANTONIO

Hey, why don't you watch where you're going, okay? 'Cause you bumped into me! 

ED

Who do you think you're talking to, pal? 

ANTONIO

Hey, get your hands off me! 

ED

Go to hell! 

JERRY

He'll get another job. He's a busboy! 

GEORGE

It won't for a while. At least not until after the cast comes off. 

JERRY

It was that fall down the stairs. That's what did it. 

GEORGE

That's not how it happened. It's when he fell on him with his knee. 

ELAINE

Oh, that was awful. Poor Antonio. (Waiter hands Elaine two bags of food to go) ..Thanks. 

GEORGE

So, much longer? 

ELAINE

Till when - till he goes back to Seattle, or till he can feed himself? 

GEORGE

(Not wanting to make Elaine mad) I guess it's not important. 

ELAINE

Take care of yourselves. (Leaves) 

GEORGE

I should probably get going too. If I don't feed Pequita by seven, she goes all over everything.. take it easy. 

JERRY

Yeah.. (Takes a bite of his sandwich as the waiter starts cleaning off the table) How ya doing? 

JERRY

First of all, I can't believe that people actually do fight. People have fist fights in life. I can't really believe that we have boxing either. It's really kind of an amazing thing. To me, the problem with boxing is - you have two guys having a fight that have no prior argument. Why don't they have the boxers come into the ring in little cars, drive around a bit, have a little accident? They get out, 'Didn't you see my signal?' 'Look at that fender!' ..Then you'd see a real fight. 

JULIANNA

...And usually for lunch I'll have a salad, and for dinner, I eat whatever I want. 

JERRY

What do you think the worst part of being blind is? 

JULIANNA

Excuse me? 

JERRY

You know, if you were blind, what do you think the worst part of it would be? 

JULIANNA

I don't know. 

JERRY

I think it would be not being able to tell if there was bugs in my food. How could you ever enjoy a meal like that? I'd constantly be feeling around with my lips and my tongue. 

JULIANNA

Well that's how my five-year old eats. He's a very picky eater. 

JERRY

You hear about that kid that was kidnapped the other day in Pennsylvania? 

JULIANNA

No. 

JERRY

He was at a carnival with his mother. She goes to get a hot dog, next thing you know she turns around, boom, he's gone. 

JULIANNA

Oh. 

JERRY

Imagine how sick a person has to be to do something like that. (she starts the quick hand chops on his back) And these people are all over the place. You never know who's crazy, I could be one of these people. 

JULIANNA

Have you seen any good movies? 

JERRY

Who takes care of your boy during the day? 

JULIANNA

We have a woman. Why? 

JERRY

No no. I'm just saying. 

JULIANNA

She had references. 

JERRY

Oh I'm sure she did, I'm sure they're impeccable. I'm talking about the ones that forge `em. 

JERRY

(about the massage)You know I think this is really helping. 

JULIANNA

I don't live near here, ya know! 

JERRY

So she's giving me the massage and I'm just making conversation. 

ELAINE

I don't like to talk during a massage. 

JERRY

Neither do I, but I do it for them. I figure they're bored. 

GEORGE

Yeah, I do that too. I feel guilty about getting the pleasure. I feel like I don't deserve it so I talk. It stops me from enjoying it. There's nothing to eat in here. 

ELAINE

Oh! I forgot to tell you-- 

JERRY

I'm in the middle of a story. 

ELAINE

Oh, okay, go ahead. 

GEORGE

Why don't you ever go shopping? 

JERRY

Well it's not like it's a really funny story or anything. 

ELAINE

What happened? 

JERRY

Well so she mentioned that she had a son, and then for some reason, I launch into the story about the kid from Pennsylvania who was abducted. 

ELAINE

Oh, wasn't that terrible? 

JERRY

Yes, it was. 

GEORGE

Not even an apple. 

ELAINE

She doesn't want to hear that, that was stupid. 

JERRY

I know it was stupid. 

ELAINE

Really stupid. (she takes a big sip from her bottled water.) 

JERRY

Hey, I just said it was stupid. 

GEORGE

What about this leftover Chinese food? 

JERRY

Take it. 

ELAINE

I can't believe you said that. 

JERRY

Hey, would you stop it already? 

ELAINE

So, what'd she say? 

JERRY

I don't know, she actually seemed to get a little paranoid. 

GEORGE

(he just took a bite of the Chinese food ) This is terrible. What is this, ginger? I hate ginger. I can't understand how anyone can eat ginger. (puts the container back in the refrigerator.) 

ELAINE

I have a good masseuse you could go to. 

JERRY

Nah, she's really good and she's not just a masseuse, she's a physical therapist. There's a big difference. She uses the ultrasound, it's a real medical procedure. In fact, if you get a doctor's note, it's covered by insurance. 

GEORGE

Physical therapy is covered by insurance? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

GEORGE

You don't have to pay for the massage? 

JERRY

Not if you have a doctor's note. 

ELAINE

So where do you get this note? 

JERRY

Well I've never actually done it but if I really wanted to I could probably get one from my friend Roy, the dentist. 

GEORGE

Right, your friend Roy. 

ELAINE

What's the name of this physical therapist? 

JERRY

I'll tell you, but don't ask her anything about her kid, she a little off. 

GEORGE

And you don't have to pay. 

GEORGE

We have a, three-o'clock appointments. 

RECEPTIONIST

George and Elaine, right? 

ELAINE

Right. 

RECEPTIONIST

Could you fill these out for me please? And um, Elaine, you'll be seeing Julianna... 

ELAINE

(quietly) Ok. 

RECEPTIONIST

... And George, you'll be with Raymond. 

GEORGE

Excuse me, did you say 'Raymond'? 

RECEPTIONIST

Yes. 

GEORGE

But, uh, Raymond is a man. 

RECEPTIONIST

That's right. 

GEORGE

I can't get a massage from a man. 

ELAINE

Why not? 

GEORGE

What, are you crazy? I can't have a man touching me. Switch with me. 

ELAINE

No, I don't want the man either. 

GEORGE

What's the difference, you're a woman. They're supposed to be touching you. 

ELAINE

He'd just be touching your back. 

GEORGE

He'd just be touching your back too. 

ELAINE

No, it could get sexual. 

GEORGE

I know. That's the point. If it's gonna get sexual, it should get sexual with you. 

ELAINE

I wouldn't be comfortable. 

GEORGE

I would? What if something happens? 

ELAINE

What could happen? 

GEORGE

What if it felt good? 

ELAINE

It's supposed to feel good. 

GEORGE

I don't want it to feel good. 

ELAINE

Then why get the massage? 

GEORGE

Exactly! 

RAYMOND

George? 

GEORGE

Yes? 

RAYMOND

I'm Raymond. (with a big smile) 

GEORGE

Hello.(with not a big smile) 

RAYMOND

Are you ready? (smiling, he looks at Elaine. She smiles back at him while looking all the way up there at the tall, handsome Raymond.) 

RAYMOND

...And then Julianna asked me if I wanted to join her here in the office. 

GEORGE

Really. 

RAYMOND

Use to be a flight attendant. 

GEORGE

Oh boy. 

RAYMOND

Ya know, why don't ya, open those pants, it's gonna be a lot easier that way. 

RAYMOND

So what do you do? 

GEORGE

What? 

RAYMOND

I said, 'What do you do?'. 

GEORGE

I-I don't know. 

RAYMOND

You don't know what you do? 

GEORGE

Nah. 

RAYMOND

Ohh-ho, come on. Hey, you're very tense. 

GEORGE

hu, Coffee. Too much coffee (nervous laughter). 

RAYMOND

Okay, just take off those pants now, and I'll work the hamstring. 

GEORGE

Oh, the hamstring's fine. 

RAYMOND

But you wrote that it was tender. (holding the clip board) 

GEORGE

I wrote. Pfft, *I* wrote. 

RAYMOND

I'll check it out. (makes a notation on the form) 

GEORGE

Are you sure? 

RAYMOND

Yeah, take 'em off. (continues writing) 

RAYMOND

How did you hurt this? 

GEORGE

I don't know. 

RAYMOND

You don't know? 

GEORGE

No. 

RAYMOND

But you just told me-- 

GEORGE

Korea. 

RAYMOND

You hurt it in Korea? 

GEORGE

What? 

RAYMOND

The hamstring. 

GEORGE

Korea. 

RAYMOND

How? 

GEORGE

Hamstring. 

RAYMOND

How did you hurt the hamstring? 

GEORGE

Hotel. 

ELAINE

How'd it go? George? 

JERRY

No appointments at all? Because my neck is still tight. What about Thursday? And Friday? Oh boy. Okay, thanks anyway. 

JERRY

What's with you? 

GEORGE

A... ah... 

JERRY

Yes, A...? 

GEORGE

A man gave me... 

JERRY

Yes, a man gave you...? 

GEORGE

A man gave me... a massage. hu, hu... 

JERRY

So? 

GEORGE

So he... had his hands and, uh, he was uh... 

JERRY

He was what?! 

GEORGE

He-he was uh... touching and rubbing. (nervous laugh) 

JERRY

That's a massage. 

GEORGE

And then I took my pants off. 

JERRY

You took your pants off? 

GEORGE

For my hamstring. 

JERRY

Oh. 

GEORGE

He got about uh, two inches from... there. 

JERRY

Really? 

GEORGE

I think it moved. 

JERRY

Moved? 

GEORGE

It may have moved, I don't know. 

JERRY

I'm sure it didn't move. 

GEORGE

It moved! It was imperceptible but I-I felt it. 

JERRY

Maybe it just wanted to change positions? You know, shift to the other side. 

GEORGE

No, no. It wasn't a shift, I've shifted, this was a move. 

JERRY

Okay, so what if it moved? 

GEORGE

That's the sign! The test; if a - if a man makes it move. 

JERRY

That's not the test. Contact is the test, if it moves, as a result of contact. 

GEORGE

You think it's contact? It has to be touched? 

JERRY

That's what a gym teacher once told me. 

KRAMER

Hey. 

JERRY

Hey. 

KRAMER

I just saw Joe DiMaggio in Dinky Donuts. You know, I-I looked in there and there he was having coffee and a donut. 

JERRY

Joe DiMaggio? In Dinky Donuts? 

KRAMER

Yeah. Joe DiMaggio. 

JERRY

No, I'm sorry, if Joe DiMaggio wants a donut, he goes to a fancy restaurant or a hotel. He's not sitting in Dinky Donuts. 

KRAMER

Well maybe he likes Dinky Donuts. 

GEORGE

I don't even like to sit next to a man on an airplane 'cause our knees might touch. 

JERRY

I can't see Joe DiMaggio sitting at the counter in little tiny filthy smelly Dinky Donuts. 

KRAMER

Why can't Joe DiMaggio have a donut like everyone else? 

JERRY

He can have a donut, 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

JERRY

...but not at Dinky. 

GEORGE

I don't even like to use urinals, always been a stall man. 

KRAMER

Look I'm tellin-- (he does a double take and looks at George) I'm telling ya, that was Joe DiMaggio. 

GEORGE

The guy slept with Marilyn Monroe, he's in Dinky Donuts. What about this doctor's note? Let's go see your friend Roy. 

JERRY

I never said I'd do that. 

GEORGE

What are you talking about, that's seventy-five bucks! I'm not working, I can't afford that. 

JERRY

I don't know how I feel about it. 

GEORGE

Oh, what are you, like, a Quaker now? 

JERRY

Alright, alright. 

KRAMER

A stall man, huh? (small laugh) 

GEORGE

All right -- (Gets up to leave) 

KRAMER

Wha-ha-a-at? (makes a gesture with his hand) 

JERRY

...so we were just kinda wondering if it was possible for you to write us a note, and if you can't, believe me, it's fine. 

GEORGE

He didn't say he can't. 

JERRY

I mean, if you feel funny about it, at all. 

GEORGE

He doesn't feel funny. 

JERRY

If he does. 

GEORGE

Do you feel funny? He didn't say anything. 

JERRY

He feels funny. You don't have to do this. 

GEORGE

He knows that! 

JERRY

Roy, should we go? Is this a breach of our friendship? 

GEORGE

Oh, can you be any more dramatic? 

ROY

Don't be ridiculous. (Notices George looking at a poster on the wall) Holyfield. He's a good friend of one of my patients. He's got a hell of a body, doesn't he? 

GEORGE

How would I know? 

ROY

Do you like him? 

GEORGE

What do you mean, like him? 

ROY

Do you like him? 

GEORGE

I mean he's a good fighter and a nice guy but I don't like him. 

ROY

How come you don't like him? 

GEORGE

Why should I? 

JERRY

What is the matter with you? 

GEORGE

Nothing, why? You think something's wrong? Am I different? 

ROY

So, you want the notes? 

JERRY

You don't have to, really. 

ROY

Nah nah, it's ok. 

JERRY

We should probably get one for Elaine, too, right George? (turns to George, who is staring intently at the Holyfield poster) George? 

JERRY

Well what about the week after? 

JERRY

No appointments at all? (motions to Elaine to move over) 

ELAINE

What? (he bumps her with his butt to move over) 

JERRY

Can I - can I at least just talk to her so I can apologize? Forget it. (Hangs up) I can't believe this, I make one innocent comment, about some lunatic in Pennsylvania and I'm cut off. This woman is insane. (Looks at Elaine for a moment) What's with you? 

ELAINE

What? 

JERRY

Well you were too close to me, I was all scrunched in there. 

ELAINE

Hey, you scrunched me. I sat down here first. 

KRAMER

Hey, I saw DiMaggio in the donut shop again. 

JERRY

Uh huh. 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

ELAINE

Joe DiMaggio? 

KRAMER

Joe DiMaggio, you know this time I went in and sat down across from him and I really watched him. I studied, his every move. For example, he dunks. 

ELAINE

Joe DiMaggio dunks his donut?! 

KRAMER

That's right. 

JERRY

See, now I know it's not him. Joe DiMaggio could not be a dunker. 

KRAMER

Oh, he's a dunker. 

ELAINE

Why couldn't he be a dunker? 

KRAMER

And nothing diverts his attention. Like, I'm uh, you know, I-I, like I'm sitting in there, you know. And, uh, I start banging on the table, you know, to uh, so that he'll look up, you know, Like I'm sitting there you know and uh, *bang* (slams the table) You know, *bang* He wouldn't move. So then I start doing these yelping noises. Like, *yip* (high pitched yelping noises) *yip*. No reaction because the guy is so focused, you see, he can just block out anything that's going on around him. See, that's how he played baseball. He dunks like he hits. 

ELAINE

So then what? 

KRAMER

Well, then the waitress, she comes up and she tells me to shut up or they're gonna throw me out. 

ELAINE

Why didn't you just call out his name? 

JERRY

What happened to you? 

GEORGE

These kids called me a Mary. 

ELAINE

A what? 

GEORGE

I was jumping over a puddle, and for some reason I went like this. (George stretches out his arms in a ballet motion) And they called me a Mary. So I chased them, and I tripped and I fell. 

KRAMER

Yeah, you know kids, they can be very perceptive. 

ELAINE

Hey, George? What is this? (laughing, Elaine makes the same outstretched arm motion) What is that? No really, what is that? 

JERRY

Hello? Oh, hi Roy. What? Oh my god. Wel-- how did this happen? What can I do? Oh. I am so sorry. Okay. Bye. (Hangs up) That was Roy. He's under investigation for insurance fraud. 

KRAMER

...just a man and not a freak, Joltin' Joe DiMaggio. Joe, Joe. Go, Joe... 

JERRY

I told you. 

GEORGE

Told me what? 

JERRY

I told you we shouldn't do it. 

GEORGE

He didn't say anything. 

JERRY

He's got a house, a family, they could take away his license. You should have heard him. Three notes, how stupid was that? We never should have got three notes. 

ELAINE

Three notes? 

JERRY

Yeah, you, me and George. 

ELAINE

You got me a note? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

ELAINE

But I got my own note. 

JERRY

You what? 

ELAINE

I got a note from my gynecologist. 

JERRY

Why'd you do that? 

ELAINE

I didn't know you were getting me a note. 

JERRY

Of course I was getting you a note. 

ELAINE

But you didn't say anything. Ohhh... 

JERRY

Neither did you, that's how he got caught. We sent in four notes from two doctors. 

GEORGE

No Doctor-- 

ELAINE

Wait a-- 

KRAMER

How can you do that to your friend? He's got a wife, kids, and a lot of other stuff. Oh, yyyeeah. 

JERRY

Hi Pam. 

PAM

Hello. 

GEORGE

Hello. 

JERRY

I just thought ahh maybe I could talk to Roy, if um... 

ROY

Pam, did the x-ray from Mrs. Sloan... Hi. 

JERRY

Hi Roy. 

GEORGE

How ya doing? 

ROY

Come on back, I have a patient but she's under. 

JERRY

I don't even know what to say. 

GEORGE

Me neither. 

JERRY

I knew this would happen. 

GEORGE

Me too. 

JERRY

I mean the whole thing, it's just... 

GEORGE

Tragic. 

JERRY

Well it's not tragic. 

GEORGE

No? 

JERRY

No, it's... 

GEORGE

Unsettling? 

JERRY

Okay. I mean, what if the-- 

PAM

I hope you're both happy. (she turns and walks away) 

JERRY

I'm not happy. 

GEORGE

Me neither. I've never been happy. 

JERRY

I mean I'm happy sometimes, but-but not now. 

GEORGE

In college, maybe. Those were fun times. 

JERRY

Yeah, college was fun. 

GEORGE

Yeah. 

JERRY

Yeah. 

PAM

You know the whole practice is in jeopardy, you know that? (she turns and walks away again.) 

ROY

Don't mind her. 

JERRY

Oh please, I love her. 

GEORGE

I've just met her but I'm very impressed. 

ROY

I can't understand, I've never had a problem with these notes before. 

JERRY

Well what's the next move, what's gonna happen now? 

ROY

Well, nothing really, as long as we get the physical therapist to go along with our story. 

JERRY

What? The physical therapist? Why? 

ROY

She just has to say the complaint was related to a dental problem. 

GEORGE

How ya doing? 

JERRY

Hi. Ah look, I know I don't have an appointment but it's really important that I talk with Julianna. 

RECEPTIONIST

I'm sorry, Mr. Seinfeld, she's not in. 

JERRY

Yeah, I know she's mad at me, but I really have to speak with her. 

RECEPTIONIST

I told you, she's not here. 

JERRY

You don't understand, ah... 

RECEPTIONIST

Look, you have to leave. 

JERRY

Wait a second, don't you-- 

JERRY

Hi. Hi. Look, I don't know what you think -- 

JULIANNA

Please! 

JERRY

--but, you see, let me just talk to you for a second, see, what I did is inadvertently sent an insurance-- 

JULIANNA

I treated you, so please, just get out of the office! 

JERRY

Can't you just listen to me? 

JULIANNA

Run Billy! Run to the office and close the door! (to the receptionist) Call the police! 

JERRY

The police? 

RAYMOND

What is the --. Hi George. (stands there with a big smile) 

GEORGE

Hello. 

JERRY

Raymond? 

ELAINE

Well, I mean it's only a six month probation, it's a slap on the wrist. 

JERRY

Yeah, I still don't see any dinner invitations forthcoming. 

GEORGE

Men have been popping into my sexual fantasies. All of a sudden I'll be, in the middle. 

ELAINE

Of what? 

GEORGE

And a guy will appear from out of nowhere. I say 'Get out of here! What do you want? You don't belong here!' 

ELAINE

What do they do? 

GEORGE

They talk back. They go, 'Hey George, how's it going?' I say, 'Get the hell out of here!' 

JERRY

Hey, it's the K-man. (he bangs on the glass to get Kramer's attention, Elaine laughs) Maybe it's time you got a different hobby. 

KRAMER

Man, Ughhhh, wwwheh.... I just came from Roy's. I threw up from the gas. 

JERRY

Did he say anything? 

KRAMER

No no, he's fine. 

JERRY

Oh my god, it's... 

GEORGE

Joe DiMaggio. 

ELAINE

(gasps) 

KRAMER

Where? 

JERRY

Having a cup of coffee. 

ELAINE

And he's dunking! 

KRAMER

Yeah -- yeah. 

JERRY

Wow. Look at him. The Yankee Clipper... 

KRAMER

(quietly) yeah. 

JERRY

...here. 

GEORGE

You see? Now that is a handsome man. (Elaine and Jerry look right at George) Oh please. 

KRAMER

Wait, wait... hold on now, wait, wait... *bang* (he slams his hand down on the table, startling Jerry, Elaine and George) *bang* (again) *yip* (another high pitched yelping sound) *yip* *yip* See? I told you. 

JERRY

What causes homophobia? What is it, that makes a heterosexual man, worry? I think it's because, men know, that deep down we have weak sales resistance. We're constantly buying shoes that hurt us, pants that don't fit right. Men think, 'Obviously I can be talked into anything. What if I accidentally wander into some sort of homosexual store, thinking it's a shoe store, and the salesman goes, 'Just hold this guy's hand, walk around the store a little bit, see how you feel. No obligation, no pressure, just try it. Would you like to see him in a sandal?'' 

PATRICE

Everyone in my family's creative. And even though I'm working as an accountant now I'd really like to eventually live exclusively on my pappe-ay mache-ay hats 

PATRICE

uh uh 

GEORGE

What if it rains? 

PATRICE

They're art. You hang them on the wall. 

PATRICE

It's my creative outlet. One of my passions. 

GEORGE

Any money in it? 

PATRICE

Who so belongs only to his age, references only popenjays and mumbo jumbos 

GEORGE

Of course, right. 

PATRICE

Thomas Carlisle, 1864. 

GEORGE

Tommy C. 

JERRY

These are the receipts from 85 and I'm going to do 86. 

KRAMER

I'm sorry. I thought it was a legitimate charity. I didn't know you'd get audited 

JERRY

I don't blame you. I blame myself. 

KRAMER

No, blame me. 

JERRY

OK, I blame you. 

KRAMER

Don't blame me. 

JERRY

What was I supposed to do? You knew I was on my first date with Elaine. You come barging in here asking me to contribute money for a volcano relief fund for krakatoa. 

KRAMER

It was supposed to erupt. 

JERRY

I find the whole thing very embarrassing. 

KRAMER

You know what my feelings are about this. I don't even pay taxes. 

JERRY

Yeah, tha's easy when you have no income. 

ELAINE

Hi, 

JERRY

Hi 

ELAINE

Kramer, do me a favour will ya'. If you insist o making pasta in my apartment please don't put the tomato sauce on the pasta while it's in the strainer. All the little squares have hardened red sauce in them. 

ELAINE

What's so funny 

JERRY

Kramer dating your room mate. It's funny. 

ELAINE

Uh, it's a riot Alice. 

KRAMER

When do you pit the sauce on? 

ELAINE

Any other time. 

KRAMER

I like to strain the sauce. 

ELAINE

And ... I could really live without the tribal music ... and the make out sessions in the living room 

KRAMER

Yeah, Tina likes the couch. 

ELAINE

What are you doing? What is all this? 

JERRY

Oh he's uh, helping me sort my receipts. I'm being audited. 

ELAINE

O, your being auditted? What for? 

JERRY

Oh, I contributed money to a charity that turned out to be fraudulent. It's very boring. 

ELAINE

When was this? 

JERRY

Uh, Along long time ago, in a galaxy far far away. 

ELAINE

I remember you donated to some volcano thing on our first date. 

JERRY

Volcano? Really? 

ELAINE

Oh, wait a minute. Don't tell me that that was ... 

JERRY

Something to drink? 

ELAINE

What did you think, that would impress me? 

JERRY

You got it ALL wrong. I was thinking only of the poor Krakatoans 

ELAINE

Like you this donation for 50 bucks and I'd start tearing my clothes off? 

JERRY

Those brave Krakatoans East of Java. who sacrifice so much for so long. 

ELAINE

Now you're being audited because of it. You see That's Karma. 

JERRY

No, that's Krama. 

ELAINE

So, waddya' going to do? 

JERRY

It's all taken care of. 

ELAINE

How is that? 

KRAMER

(chuckles) 

JERRY

An old friend of mine, whom you may have met, George Costanza, has recently become intimate with a female accountant who was formally a highly placed official with an outfit known as the IRS. And as we speak, at this very moment he is handing over to her all of my pertinent tax information. And she has assured us that the matter is well within her field of expertise. 

ELAINE

Why is she doing this? 

JERRY

I don't know. It must be love. 

GEORGE

I don't think we should see each other anymore. You're great but I'm I'm riddled with personal problems. 

PATRICE

What did I do? 

GEORGE

Nothing It's not you. It's me. I have a fear of commitment. I don't know how to love. 

PATRICE

You hate my earrings don't you? 

GEORGE

No, no, 

PATRICE

And you didn't comment on the chop sticks. 

GEORGE

I love the chop sticks. I, I personally prefer a fork but they look very nice. 

PATRICE

You're not telling me the truth. I must have done something. 

GEORGE

I have a fear of intimacy 

PATRICE

Don't give me cliches. I have a right to know. What did I do wrong? 

GEORGE

Nothing. It's not YOU.. 

PATRICE

I want the truth. 

GEORGE

The truth. you want the truth? It is your earrings It is the chopsticks but it's so much more. You're pretentious. You call everyone by their full name You call my doorman, Sammy, 'Samuel' but you didn't even say 'Samuel' You went 'Sam - U- EL' Papie-eh Mach-eh What is Papie-ay Mach-ay? 

PATRICE

Keep goin'. 

GEORGE

I, I think I made my point. I'm sorry if I was a little harsh. 

PATRICE

No, I asked for the truth. Thank you for being so honest. 

GEORGE

Can I uh, can I walk you back to work? 

PATRICE

I prefer to go alone. How much do I owe? 

GEORGE

Oh, please ... ... four dollars is f... 

JERRY

... if this audit had happened to me and I didn't have this woman to help me I would have killed this man. I would have strangled the life out of him with my bare hands 

ELAINE

I don't blame ya' 

JERRY

Have you ever been through an audit? 

ELAINE

No. 

JERRY

It's hell. It's the financial equivalent of a complete rectal examination. I would have killed this man. Torn him limb from limb, ripped the flesh right off his bones ... 

JERRY

Yeah 

GEORGE

George 

JERRY

Come up - Ah, there he is, the man himself, George Louis Costanza. Here I am about to go to the electric chair and my oldest friend is dating the governor 

GEORGE

My whole life has been a complete waste of time, (chuckle) 

JERRY

And there's so much more to go. 

GEORGE

Now I know what I am supposed to do. It's so simple. Tell the truth That's all. Just tell the truth 

JERRY

So what happened? You gave her my tax papers? ... My papers? 

GEORGE

Oh, oh, your papers 

JERRY

What happened you didn't give her the papers? 

GEORGE

No. I did. 

JERRY

SO? 

GEORGE

...I broke up with her. 

JERRY

You what? 

GEORGE

I broke up with her. 

JERRY

I'm being audited! And you broke up with her? 

GEORGE

It's OK. It's fine. She'll do it. I'm sure she'll still do it. 

JERRY

Why will she still do it? She hates you now. People don't do you favors after you dump them. 

GEORGE

Oh, no. We left on good terms. 

JERRY

How is that possible? 

GEORGE

Because I uh, I told her the truth. 

JERRY

Oh, my God. 

GEORGE

It's OK. 

JERRY

It's unheard of ... 

GEORGE

She asked me to. 

JERRY

So you lie! What did you tell her? 

GEORGE

I told her that she was pretentious. 

JERRY

Pretentious!? The woman has my tax papers. You told her she was pretentious? The IRS. They're like the MAFIA. They can take anything they want 

ELAINE

How would you like it if someone told YOU the truth? 

GEORGE

Like what? What could they say? 

ELAINE

There are plenty of things to say. 

GEORGE

Like what? I'm bald? What is it specifically? Is, is there an odor I'm not aware of? 

ELAINE

George, please. 

GEORGE

Give me one. 

ELAINE

You sure? 

GEORGE

Yes. 

ELAINE

What? 

ELAINE

Forget it. You are very careful with money. 

GEORGE

I'm cheap? You think I'm CHEAP? How could you say that to me? I can't believe this. How could you say that to me? 

ELAINE

You asked me to. 

GEORGE

You should have lied. 

ELAINE

HUH, so should you. 

JERRY

OK, wait a second, wait a second, what happened to my papers? 

ELAINE

I know. 

GEORGE

When I was working I spent baby. 

JERRY

Yeah, I know champagne, limos, cigars. WHAT happened to the papers? 

GEORGE

She put them in her pocketbook. I guess she took them with her. 

ELAINE

Pocketbook or a handbag? 

JERRY

Is that relevant? She TOOK them. Call her office. 

GEORGE

Give me the phone. (dials) Yea, Hi I would like to speak to Patrice. ... what? ... oh really? ... oh, ok, thank you, ... (hangs up) 

JERRY

What? What? 

GEORGE

She never came back from lunch. 

JERRY

This is no good. This is no good. Call her house. 

GEORGE

(dials) Hi, are you OK? no, no,.. huh, (hangs up) She hung up. 

JERRY

Not good. 

GEORGE

All right. There's nothing to be worried about. She's just a little annoyed right now. Tomorrow I'll personally go over there. I'll apologize. I'll get the papers. Don't worry. Don't worry. (exits) 

JERRY

Not good 

KRAMER

Yeah, it's a windshield. 

JERRY

I can see that. What's it for? 

KRAMER

I found it on the road. 

JERRY

Yeah (to buzzer) 

ELAINE

(from intercom) I just finished working out are you busy? 

JERRY

Come on up. 

KRAMER

Can you believe somebody threw this out? You know I'm going to make a coffee table out of this and surprise Tina. 

JERRY

wouldn't it be invisible? I mean, what, are you going to just sense it's in front of the couch? 

KRAMER

wow 

ELAINE

hell-oo 

KRAMER

hell-oo 

JERRY

What's with you two? 

ELAINE

You haven't told him? 

JERRY

Tell me what? 

ELAINE

Huh, go ahead, tell him. 

KRAMER

I, I saw her naked. 

ELAINE

He saw me naked. Kramer, ... saw me naked. 

KRAMER

Well, you know, ... it was an accident. 

ELAINE

Who walks into a woman's bedroom without knocking. I want to know! 

KRAMER

I thought it was a closet. 

JERRY

Completely naked? 

KRAMER

Completely naked. 

ELAINE

Jerrryyy, How can I go on? 

KRAMER

All right. I'll tell you what. If it's going to make you feel any better you can see me naked. 

ELAINE

No thanks! 

KRAMER

No, I want you to see me naked. 

ELAINE

No, no no. 

KRAMER

No, I want to show you. 

ELAINE

No! Jerry! Jerry! 

JERRY

OK, just a second lets not lose our heads here. Kramer you know you are always welcome in my home but as far as Mr. Johnson is concerned, that's another story. 

ELAINE

What is this? 

KRAMER

Well, it's a windshield. It's going to be your new coffee table. 

ELAINE

Ah, I'm going to kill myself on that thiing. You can't even see it. 

JERRY

You'll sense it. 

JERRY

Well, what happened? Was she there? 

GEORGE

No, no she wasn't. 

JERRY

You didn't get my papers? 

GEORGE

No, I didn't. 

JERRY

Well, where is she? 

GEORGE

A mental institution. 

JERRY

Why is it so difficult, uncomfortable, to be naked. It's because when you have clothes on you can always kinda make those little adjustments which people like to do ... you feel like you're getting it together, yeah, yeah pretty good (pulling at lapels, pockets etc.) feeling good looking good But when you're naked it's like it's so final you're, Well that's it. (no movements) There's nothing else I can do. That's why I like to wear a belt when I'm naked. Cause I feel it gives me something, I know I'm naked, but you know, (tugging and lifting belt) I like to get pockets to hang off of the belt that would be, wouldn't that be the ultimate? To be naked and still be able to do this (hand in pocket) I think that would really help a lot. 

JERRY

A mental institution? 

KRAMER

You know what they do in there? Did you see CooCoo's Nest? They put those electrodes in your head. 

GEORGE

It's not really a mental institution. It's more like a depression clinic. She went out to Woodhaven and checked herself in. I'm, I'm sick over this. 

ELAINE

Who told you this: 

GEORGE

Her roommate. I've driven women to lesbianism before but never to a mental institution. 

KRAMER

My friend Bob Sacamano had shock treatments. But his synapses were so large, it had no effect. 

JERRY

You know I hate to raise a crass financial concern but was there any information as to the where abouts of my PAPERS! 

GEORGE

She put them in her pocket book. She probably took them out there with her. 

JERRY

So what now? 

GEORGE

I don't know. 

JERRY

Can we go out there? 

GEORGE

Where? 

JERRY

Woodhaven. 

GEORGE

We could. 

GEORGE

I'm very nervous about this. I've never spoken to a mental patient before. 

JERRY

My cousin Douglas was in a place like this one time . He came over to my house for dinner. There was no soda and he went bezerk. He was screamin' 'where's the Pepsi, where's the Pepsi?' 

GEORGE

I should be in a place like this. I envy this woman. Ya' get to wear slippers all day. Friends visit. They pity you. Pity is very underrated. I like it it's good. Plus they give you those word association tests. I love those. 

JERRY

That'd be great. There's no wrong answer. 

GEORGE

Potato 

JERRY

Tuberculosis 

GEORGE

GEORGE

Oh, boy. Here she comes. 

ELAINE

Oh, my god. 

ELAINE

KRAMER! 

KRAMER

Hey. 

ELAINE

WILL YOU PLEASE PUT SOMETHING ON. 

KRAMER

Listen uh, you want some leftovers? I made some African food. There's, yambalas and uh, sambusa. 

TINA

Kramer, are you coming back to bed? 

KRAMER

Yeah, yeah, I'll be right there baby. 

TINA

Oh, hi Elaine. (returns Elaine's ear rings) What did you think of the coffee table? 

ELAINE

It's invisible. 

KRAMER

So, is everything cool? or what? 

TINA

Yeah, um, you seem little bit dysfunctional. 

ELAINE

Well, 

TINA

Come on Elaine. just tell us the truth. 

ELAINE

The Truth!, You want The Truth? 

PATRICE

Who are you? 

GEORGE

Oh, this is my friend Jerry. 

PATRICE

Why are you talking like that? And what do YOU want? 

JERRY

Want, want? What could I possibly want? Uh, I just came because I, I heard so many nice things about you from George. 

PATRICE

George thinks I'm pretentious. 

GEORGE

Pretentious? Who, who isn't pretentious? Ha, ha, if everyone who was pretentious was in a mental institution, ... uh, obviously THIS isn't a mental institution. 

PATRICE

You're just trying to take it all back because you're feeling guilty I'm in here. 

GEORGE

No, that's not it at all. 

PATRICE

Don't LIE George. 

GEORGE

Uh, we're cool. Everything's cool (to security attendent) 

JERRY

Just chatting. Friendly. 

GEORGE

All righty, no reason for us to uh, raise our voices. 

PATRICE

I know what you said. You can't change that. 

GEORGE

What I said? I say stupid things all the time I can't go two minutes without saying stupid things. 

JERRY

It's one stupid thing after another. So let me ask you, when you come to one of these places, what do you bring your pocketbook? 

GEORGE

You should be the one criticizing me. I, I'm lucky to even know someone like you. 

PATRICE

You mean that? 

GEORGE

Of course I mean that. I am incapable of guile. 

JERRY

He's never guiled. You know some women keep a lot of important papers in their, uh, pocket books. Like for example oh, someone else's personal financial papers. 

PATRICE

Papers? Oh, Jerry, You're the Jerome with the tax problem. You know after that day with George I got so cuckoo I threw out all your papers. So I'd love to help you but I'll need the copies. 

JERRY

there are no copies. 

PATRICE

So are you saying you want to continue seeing me? 

JERRY

Who makes copies? 

ELAINE

The truth is ... I think you make ... a very nice couple. 

KRAMER

Oh, 

TINA

Kramer, 

TINA

Here Kramer? 

KRAMER

No, lets go to the couch... 

JERRY

(on phone)Yes, I'm trying to get a copy of a receipt for a computer that I bought there.... it was 1987 ... I remember I talked to a guy - he had like a maroon sport jacket - and he might have had a toupee - oh, it was a weave - ok uh, then I'll come bye ok, bye. 

JERRY

Anybody want to take a walk down to 48th street? I think I may have tracked down another receipt. 

ELAINE

I can't. I have to go visit Tina in the hospital. 

JERRY

George? 

GEORGE

I'm going to a poetry reading with PATRICE: First time poets, in a burnt out building, down by the docks, Supposed to be good. 

KRAMER

Hey, Are you going to the hospital now? 

ELAINE

Yeah, I suppose I am. 

KRAMER

All right, great, great uh, we'll share a cab. 

JERRY

You're going by 48th St. You can give me a ride. 

GEORGE

Hey, I'm getting in on that. 

ELAINE

You know you're chippin' in. 

GEORGE

You're going that way anyway! 

JERRY

I was audited last year. At first I thought well, IRS kinda sounds like Toys R Us maybe won't be so bad. Maybe they have a sense of fun about it, you know. But it's it's bad. It's an ordeal. And they don't do anything to keep your spirits up through the ordeal. I think they should take all your receipts and put them in one of those big Lucite sweepstake drums and just kinda crank it around there. You know give me a feeling like you might win something. You know what I mean? Then they can pull them out one by one and go 'Oh, I'm sorry that's another illegal deduction. But we do have some lovely parting gifts for you. Jail!' 

HELEN

(looking by the window) They were supposed to be here at 7:30. Call the airlines again. 

MORTY

(searching in a kitchen drawer) What happened to the scotch tape? Who takes the scotch tape? Nobody returns anything around here. 

HELEN

Oh I think that's them! 

MORTY

You what I'll do next time? I'll hide it so nobody can find it. 

ALL

Hi, welcome, greetings, hugs, etc. 

MORTY

Welcome to Florida! 

ELAINE

Hi Mr. Seinfeld! (hug) 

JERRY

Hey, there's the old man! (hug) 

MORTY

So, what took you so long? 

JERRY

Ahh, we waited 35 minutes in the rent-a-car place. 

HELEN

I don't know why you had to rent a car. We would have picked you up. 

JERRY

What's the difference? 

HELEN

You could have used our car. 

JERRY

I don't wanna use your car. 

HELEN

What's wrong with our car? 

JERRY

Nothing. It's a fine car. What if you wanna use it? 

HELEN

We don't use it. 

MORTY

What are you talking? We use it. 

HELEN

If you were using it, we wouldn't use it. 

JERRY

So what would you do? You'd hitch? 

HELEN

How much is a rent-a-car? 

JERRY

I don't know. 25 bucks a day. 

HELEN

What? You're crazy. 

MORTY

Plus the insurance. 

JERRY

Oh, I didn't get the insurance. 

MORTY

How could you not get the insurance? 

HELEN

We'll pay for the car. 

JERRY

You're not paying for it. 

HELEN

Morty. (asking him to back her. He doesn't) 

JERRY

God it's so hot in here. Why don't you put on the air conditioning? 

HELEN

You don't need the air conditioner. So, you have your speech all ready? 

JERRY

It's not a speech. Do I have to make a speech? 

HELEN

Of course, they're giving a testimonial for your father. You could do your comic routines. 

JERRY

(ironically) Oh yeah, that will go over real well with that crowd. 

ELAINE

(looking by the window) Ooh, you have a lake? 

JERRY

The lake isn't real. 

HELEN

The lake is real. 

MORTY

Are you kidding? They built the lake. 

HELEN

But it's real. It's water. 

HELEN

Where are you going with those? 

JERRY

I'm gonna put Elaine's stuff in here. 

HELEN

Don't sleep in there. You can you use the bedroom. 

ELAINE

I can't take your bedroom. 

HELEN

I'm up at 6 o'clock in the morning. 

ELAINE

I can't kick you out of your bed. 

HELEN

We don't even sleep. 

JERRY

Ma. 

HELEN

But this is sofa bed, you'll be uncomfortable. 

JERRY

(to Morty) What about you? 

MORTY

Why should I be comfortable? 

JERRY

(to Helen) What about him? 

HELEN

Don't worry, he's comfortable. 

MORTY

I'll sleep standing up. I'll be fine. 

HELEN

Will you stop? 

ELAINE

Yeah, I'll just stay in here. (goes in the guest room) 

HELEN

Jerry, (asking Jerry to go in the kitchen so Elaine won't hear) Jerry. You don't have to stay on the couch on my account. The two of you could stay in there together. 

JERRY

Na, that's not such a good idea. 

HELEN

Well I tought that... 

JERRY

Not now. She's right inside. 

HELEN

(quieter) What happened? 

JERRY

I don't know. We decided we don't really work as a couple. 

HELEN

What does that mean? 

JERRY

Well... 

MORTY

(comes to the kitchen and with a loud voice) Why are you whispering? 

JERRY

Shh! Nothing, nothing. 

HELEN

Elaine... 

MORTY

(still loud) What about her? 

JERRY

(tries to explain to Morty but Elaine then comes out of the guest room to get more luggage, so he fakes a conversation) ...but you know, look at the sun-dried tomatoes. Where were they five years ago? It just goes to show you. You never know what... huh (waiting for Elaine to go back in the guest room) you know... huh... What could happen to a vegetable. It could just take right off at any time. (Morty finally gets it. So Jerry goes on quieter) We've tried all kind of arrangements, but we can't seem to be friends when we sleep together. 

MORTY

(Morty goes on louder! Did he ever whisper in any episode? :-) Why do you need more friends? You've got plenty of friends. 

HELEN

He's an idealist. 

MORTY

What the hell are you looking for? 

JERRY

I'm looking. That's the point. I like looking. 

HELEN

He likes looking. 

MORTY

So look. 

HELEN

But how long can you look? 

JERRY

I'm going for the record. 

HELEN

You know your father wouldn't say so but he's really glad you came. 

JERRY

Oh, come on. 

HELEN

This is a big thing for him. Outgoing president of the condo association. 

MORTY

Aha! 

DORIS

So they arrived safely. 

MORTY

(to Jerry) You remember Jack and Doris? 

JERRY

Nice to see you. This is Elaine. 

ELAINE

Hi. Nice to meet you. 

JACK

So Jerry, you came all the way down here for this? 

ELAINE

And scuba diving. 

HELEN

Scuba diving? Who's going scuba diving? 

JERRY

We're going scuba diving. We'll be back in time. 

HELEN

What do you have to go scuba diving for? 

JERRY

For fun. 

HELEN

For fun? 

MORTY

Jack have some spong cake. 

JACK

No. thanks, no. 

MORTY

Jack is emceeing tomorrow. He's in charge of the whole thing. 

JACK

So Jerry, your mother told me you're gonna do one your little comedy skits tomorrow? 

JERRY

I don't think so. 

JACK

No? Listen Morty you wanna settle up for last night? (Morty nods) All right. I owe you 19.45$ (he gets his checks book and a pen from his pocket). 

MORTY

What did you have? You had the minute steak? 

JACK

Yeah. 

MORTY

Did you have a coke or what? 

JACK

I did NOT have a coke. 

MORTY

Somebody had a coke. 

HELEN

Oh I had a coke. 

DORIS

And I had the scampi. 

JACK

So that's 17.10$ and the tax and the tip. 

MORTY

All right. Make it 20 bucks. 

JACK

It's: 19.45$, Morty. (he gives him the check) 

MORTY

19.45$ ? 

JACK

See? You know your father. He can't get a write to the penny, but that's why he was such a good president. 

JERRY

What kind of pen is that? 

JACK

This pen? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

JACK

This is an astronaut pen. It writes upside down. They use this in space. 

JERRY

Wow! That's the astronaut pen. I heard about that. Where did you get it? 

JACK

Oh it was a gift. 

JERRY

Cause sometimes I write in bed and I have to turn and lean on my elbow to make the pen work. 

JACK

Take the pen. 

JERRY

Oh no. 

JACK

Go ahead. 

JERRY

I couldn't 

JACK

Come on, take the pen! 

JERRY

I can't take it. 

JACK

Do me a personal favor! 

JERRY

No, I'm not... 

JACK

Take the pen! 

JERRY

I cannot take it! 

JACK

Take the pen! 

JERRY

Are you sure? 

JACK

Positive! Take the pen! 

JERRY

O.K. Thank you very much. Thank you. Gee, boy! 

HELEN

Jack, what are you doing? 

JACK

Stop it! 

DORIS

Jack, we should go. (they go to the door) It was nice meeting you. 

ELAINE

Mmm, nice to meet you. 

JERRY

Thanks again. 

JACK

Come on! 

DORIS

(to Morty) She's adorable. (they leave) 

HELEN

(as soon as the door's closed) What did you take his pen for? 

JERRY

What he gave it to me. 

HELEN

You didn't have to take it. 

MORTY

Oh my God! She's gotta make a big deal out of everything. 

JERRY

He offered it to me. 

HELEN

Because you made such a big fuss about it. 

JERRY

I liked it. Should I have said I didn't like it? 

HELEN

You shouldn't have said anything. What did you expect him to do? (the camera shows Elaine shaking her head at their dispute) 

JERRY

He could have said: 'Thank you, I like it too' and put it back in his pocket. 

HELEN

He loves that pen. 

MORTY

Oh come on! 

HELEN

He talks about it all the time. Every time he takes it out he goes on and on about how it writes upside down, how the astronauts use it. 

JERRY

If he likes it so much, he never should have offered it. 

HELEN

He didn't think you'd accpet. 

JERRY

Well, he was wrong. 

HELEN

I know his wife. She has some mouth on her. She'll tell everyone in the condo now that you made him give you the pen. They're talking about it right now. (again we see Elaine smiling at their argument) 

JERRY

So you want me to return it? 

HELEN

Yes. 

MORTY

He's not gonna return the pen. That's ridiculous. 

JERRY

Hey I don't even want the pen now! 

MORTY

Jack can afford to give away a pen with all his money. Believe me. He gives me a check for 19.45. He didn't have a Coke. Ho, ho, ho! 

ELAINE

Here, let me see it. (She takes a pad to try the pen) Hey, it writes upside down. 

ELAINE

Come in. 

JERRY

Are you O.K. in here? 

ELAINE

Why is it so hot in here? How can they sleep like this? 

JERRY

It's only for three days. Today's over and we have tommorow. We leave on Sunday. It's one day, really. 

ELAINE

Oh man. What is with this bar? It's right in my back. It's killing me. 

JERRY

Oh you wanna switch? I'm sleeping on a love seat. I've got my feet up in the air like I'm in a space capsule. 

ELAINE

I am never gonna fall asleep. 

JERRY

Oh, no don't say that. You'll jinx me. 

ELAINE

How can they not put the air conditioning on? 

JERRY

They're nuts with temperature. 

ELAINE

This bar is right in my back! It's making a dent. 

JERRY

How about that guy writing a check for 19.45? 

ELAINE

I'm sweating here. I'm in bed, sweating. 

JERRY

It's one day. Half a day, really. I mean you substract showers and meals, it's like twenty minutes. It will go by like that. (snapping his fingers) 

MORTY

Stay on 95 South to Biscayne Boulevard. Then you make a left turn. Put you blinker on immediatly, there's an abutment there. Then you're gonna merge over very quickly, but stay on Biscayne. Don't get off Biscayne. You understand me? 

JERRY

Stay on Biscayne. 

HELEN

You're going underwater? 

JERRY

Yes. Generally that's where scuba diving is done. 

HELEN

What do you have to go underwater for? What's down there that's so special? 

JERRY

What's so special up here? 

ELAINE

Oh! 

HELEN

What's the matter? 

ELAINE

My back. 

HELEN

What happened? 

ELAINE

That... That bed. The bar was right in my back. 

HELEN

(to Jerry) I told you to let us sleep in there. 

JERRY

Then YOU would be hunched over. 

ELAINE

I don't even know if I can go scuba diving. 

JERRY

You can't go? 

HELEN

So stay home. 

ELAINE

You can go. 

JERRY

Without you? That's the whole reason you came down here. 

HELEN

Don't go. 

JERRY

You sure? 

MORTY

Maybe you should see a doctor. 

JERRY

We'll stay in a hotel tonight. 

ELAINE

(whispering to Jerry) Yes! 

HELEN

No, we'll stay in there. 

JERRY

Why don't you get a new sofa? 

MORTY

Nobody uses it. 

JERRY

I'm buying you a new sofa. 

HELEN

Oh Jerry, don't talk crazy. 

ELAINE

Mrs Seinfeld, please. I am begging you. Put the air conditioner on. 

HELEN

You're hot? 

ELAINE

I've lost 6 pounds. 

HELEN

I don't even know how to work it. 

MORTY

I keep telling her it's like an oven in here. 

EVELYN

Is everybody up? 

JERRY

Hi. How are you? 

EVELYN

Hello Jerry. 

JERRY

Evelyn, this is Elaine. 

ELAINE

(with pain) Hi Evelyn. 

EVELYN

Jerry you got thin. 

JERRY

Too thin? 

HELEN

Oh stop worrying so much about how you look. 

EVELYN

So where's the new pen? (everybody's surprised by this question) 

JERRY

(Jerry scratches his head and acts like he's not sure what she's talking about) What? 

EVELYN

The pen. The one Jack Klompus gave you. 

HELEN

How did you know that? 

EVELYN

Blanche told me. 

HELEN

Blanche? 

EVELYN

That's some good pen. It writes upside down. 

ELAINE

The astronauts use them. 

HELEN

What did Blanche say? 

EVELYN

I don't know. She said Jerry wanted the pen. 

JERRY

I never really wanted the pen. 

MORTY

He gave him the pen. 

HELEN

Morty. 

EVELYN

Why you don't like the pen? 

JERRY

No, no, I... 

EVELYN

Cause if you don't like it, give it back to him. 

HELEN

Is that what she said? 

EVELYN

Who? 

HELEN

Blanche. 

EVELYN

What are you talking about? 

HELEN

Hello? Oh hello Gussy. What? Jerry wouldn't do that. Jack gave it to him. All he said was he liked it. I mean nobody put a gun to his head. (to Jerry) You're giving him back that pen. (She continues the discussion with Gussy but we don't hear it.) 

ELAINE

Somebody please-- THE AIR CONDITIONER! 

MORTY

(Morty gets up) Oh! I forgot all about it. 

JERRY

All I said was 'I like the pen'. 

MORTY

How the hell do you work this thing? 

HELEN

Maybe you shouldn't go tonight. 

ELAINE

No no, I wanna go. 

HELEN

But your back hurts. 

MORTY

Maybe a couple of muscle relaxers would help. 

ELAINE

Oh, oh, O.K. (Helen holds her sweater tight against herself) You can turn down the air conditioning if you want. 

HELEN

No. I'm fine. 

ELAINE

You're not too cold? 

HELEN

No. 

JERRY

Don't be alarmed. 

MORTY

Oh my God! What the hell happened to you? 

JERRY

I'm O.K. My capillaries burst. 

HELEN

Your capillaries? Do you know what you look like? 

JERRY

(to Elaine on the floor) How are you doing? 

ELAINE

Having a good time! 

JERRY

Is it my imagination or is it freezing in here? 

HELEN

What happened to your eyes? 

JERRY

Well I started to go under... 

HELEN

With the instructor? 

JERRY

Yeah, and I got about ten feet down and I felt this tremendous pressure on my mask. Like my eyeballs were being sucked out of their sockets. 

HELEN

I told you... 

JACK

Excuse me. (to Helen) Doris would like to borrow red your pocketbook to go with her shoes. (to Elaine on the floor) The shoes have to match the pocketbook. (to the others) What's she doing? Yoga? 

ELAINE

My back hurts. 

JACK

Morty you gotta hurry up. Get ready. 

MORTY

We got plenty of time. 

JACK

(to Jerry) What happened to you? 

JERRY

I got in a fist fight with one of the ladies at the pool. 

HELEN

It's from scuba diving. 

JACK

What's there to see underwater? 

JERRY

Listen M. Klompus, it was really a nice gesture of you to give me the pen, but I don't really need it. 

JACK

You what? 

JERRY

I mean it's a terrific pen, but I think you should keep it. (he hands the pen to Jack) 

JACK

Well I mean... 

JERRY

Take it. 

JACK

All right! (he smiles and take it) 

MORTY

You know Jack, you've got a hell of a nerve taking that kid's pen. 

JACK

Whose pen? 

MORTY

His pen. 

JACK

This happens to be my pen. 

MORTY

You didn't give it to him. 

JACK

What are you talking about? He pratically begged me for it. 

MORTY

Where do you come off with this crap? 

JACK

Listen, do you think I take everything everybody offers me? You offered me sponge cake yesterday. Did I take it? 

MORTY

You said you didn't want it! 

JACK

Of course I wanted it! I love sponge cake! 

MORTY

Then who the hell said you couldn't have any? I mean what the hell do I care whether you have sponge cake? 

JACK

Because I saw the look on your face last week when I took the scotch tape! 

MORTY

Ahh! Ahh! So YOU got the scotch tape! I've been looking all over for it! 

JACK

Don't worry about it! I'll give it back! 

MORTY

I don't want it! 

JACK

I don't want it! 

MORTY

You know Jack, do me a favor will you? Take the pen and the scotch tape, and get the hell out of here! 

JACK

Listen do you think I give a damn? 

MORTY

Aah! (Jack leaves) The nerve of that guy! Taking back that pen. Well that's it for them. 

JERRY

What is going on in this community! Are you people aware of what's happening? What is driving you to this behavior? Is it the humudity? Is it the Muzak? Is it the white shoes? 

HELEN

I have no use for either one of them. I don't even want them there tonight. (she still has the pocketbook in her hands) 

JERRY

Isn't he supposed to be the emcee? 

MORTY

yeah, he's supposed to be the emcee. 

JERRY

Well. This should be a very interesting evening. 

ELAINE

(still on the floor) Uh... What about those muscle relaxers? 

PHOTOGRAPHER

Say astronaut. 

ELAINE

Say what? (laughing) Say what? 

JERRY

(Jerry brings her back) You took too many of those pills. 

MORTY

Astronaut? 

HELEN

Say it. 

HELEN

Astronaut! 

ELAINE

(still laughing, she says it just as the picture is taking) Astro...naut! 

MORTY

Good. O.K. (the photographer walks away) What about last year when I took him to the hospital every day? Did he ever say thank you? 

JERRY

Oh God. (foreseeing an arm's grabbing as he sees Uncle Leo entering with his wife Stella) 

JERRY

(to Leo) Uncle Leo. 

LEO

Hello! 

STELLA

Morty are you nervous? 

MORTY

What nervous? 

LEO

(to Jerry while he's grabbing his arm as usual) What's with the sunglasses? Who are you? Van Johnson? 

JERRY

I've got a black eye. 

STELLA

(to Elaine in a childish voice) Hello. 

JERRY

Oh uh, Elaine, this is my aunt Stella. 

HELEN

(shouting as she imitates Marlon Brando) STELLA! STELLA! 

JERRY

(to Stella) Her back hurts. 

STELLA

Humm... We saw you on 'The Tonight Show' last week. 

LEO

I thought Johnny was very rude to you. He didn't even let you talk. 

JERRY

No, no. 

LEO

You need some new material. I've heard you do that dog routine three times already. 

ELAINE

(still with her imitation, shouting even louder) STELLA! STELLA! 

LEO

Listen, you should get your cousin Jeffrey to write some material for you. 

MORTY

What are you talking? Jeffrey works for the parks department! 

LEO

You should read the letters he's written. He's funnier than the whole bunch of you! (Jack enters with Doris) Oh, here's Jack. We should sit down. 

STELLA

(to Helen on a sarcastic tone of voice) This better be good. I'm missing 'Golden Girls' for this. 

HELEN

(laughing hypocritically till Stella walks away) I hate her like poison. 

JACK

(on the microphone) Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, every year, Phase Two of the Pines of Mark Gables honors the previous year president. And this year we are honoring Morty Seinfeld (the crowd applause and someone yells: Morty!) A man who slept more hours on the job than Ronald Reagan. 

MORTY

(to Helen) Slept on the job? (she shushed him) 

JACK

Being president of the condo is not easy. It requires hard work, dedication, and commitment, and unfortunately he possesses none of these qualities. (everyone laugh except Jerry, Helen, and Morty. Even Elaine who's still druggy) 

HELEN

(Morty complains again to Helen) He's joking. 

JACK

His administration did excel in one department: the hiring of incompetents. 

MORTY

(to Jack, loud) That's what you say. 

JACK

But we do owe him a debt of gratitude because by not fixing the crack in the sidewalk, he put Mrs Ziven out of commission for a few weeks. (Morty is now the only one not laughing) 

MORTY

(loud) Tell them when you took my son's pen back. Tell them about that! (he gets up) 

JERRY

Dad! 

MORTY

(to the crowd) He gave my son a pen, and then he takes it back. Tell them about that! 

JACK

He gave it to me! 

MORTY

Come on. That's enough, sit down! 

JACK

I'm not sitting down! 

JACK

Ow! You broke my dental plate! (Jack is touching his dental plate while Morty reaches in Jack's pocket to get the pen) Doris! He broke my dental plate. You son-of-a-bitch! I'm gonna sue you. (he leaves the table and Morty follows him and continue arguing with him. Jerry now have the microphone in his hands and the crowd begins to think the ceremony is over.) 

HELEN

Jerry, do your act. 

JERRY

(in the microphone, but to Helen) I can't. Nobody's even listening. 

HELEN

They're all gonna leave. 

JERRY

(to himself) Oh God! (in the microphone) huh... Hey! How you folks doing tonight? (everybody in the crowd is talking over Jerry) 

CROWD

Who are you? 

JERRY

(still with his sunglasses) Have you ever noticed how they always give you the peanuts on the planes? 

CROWD

(to heckle Jerry) Not my Harry. He flies first class. 

JERRY

Who ever thought the first thing somebody wants on a plane is a peanut? 

CROWD

I'd rather have a bottle of scotch! 

HELEN

(to Jerry) Do the dog routine. 

JERRY

All I said was I liked the pen! 

ELAINE

(wakes up and yells very loud) STELLA! 

CHIROPRACTOR

You could aggravate it. I wouldn't go anywhere for at least five days. 

ELAINE

Five days? You want me to stay here for five more days? 

JERRY

There must be some mistake. 

CHIROPRACTOR

I'm afraid not. 

ELAINE

(discouraged) Five days. Here. 

HELEN

(to Jerry, happily) So we have you for five more days! 

JERRY

(to Elaine) Well there's really no point in me staying. I mean you just gonna be... 

ELAINE

Excuse me? 

JERRY

Nothing. 

EVELYN

Good morning. 

JERRY

Hi Evelyn. 

EVELYN

(to Helen) Has Morty decided on a lawyer yet? 

HELEN

I don't think so. 

EVELYN

Because my nephew Larry could do it. He's a brilliant lawyer. He says Jack has no case. 

HELEN

Well I'll ask him when he gets up. 

EVELYN

Oh, and I spoke to Arnold. And he says that according to the bylaws of the condo constitution, they need six votes to throw you out for unruly behavior. Not five. Doctor Chernov is the one you'll have to suck up to. 

MORTY

Aw! Aw! Oh my back! Oh my back! It's that bar. Who the hell could sleep on that thing? 

HELEN

I was very comfortable. 

EVELYN

Morty, Arnold says they need six votes to throw you out. 

HELEN

It's in the constitution. 

MORTY

(to the chiro) Who are you? 

CHIROPRACTOR

I'm a chiropractor. 

MORTY

What are you kidding me? 

ELAINE

(to Jerry) Five more days? 

JERRY

Well today's almost over. And weekdays always go by fast. Friday we're leaving. It's like two days really. It's like a cup of coffee. It will go by like that. (snapping his fingers) 

JERRY

Is Florida not hot and muggy enough for these people? They love heat. I mean if they ever decide to land men on the sun, I think these old retired guys would be the only ones that will be able to handle it. They'll just sit there on the sun, on the redwood benches, washcloth on the head going: 'Close the door, you're letting all the heat off the sun. I'm trying to get a sweat going.' 

JERRY

So I'm on the plane, we left late. Pilot says we're going to be making up some time in the air. I thought, well isn't that interesting. We'll just make up time. That's why you have to reset your watch when you land. Of course, when they say they're making up time, obviously they're increasing the speed of the aircraft. Now, my question is if you can go faster, why don't you just go as fast as you can all the time? C'mon, there's no cops up here, nail it. Give it some gas! We're flying! 

GAVIN

Travelling, of course, is the best education. Do you know last year I was in over forty, forty-five countries, and I would have gone to more but I had just got a puppy, and he was too young to take with me. But now I won't travel without him. 

JERRY

Is he on the plane now? 

GAVIN

Oh yes. Yes, he's in the, he's in the baggage compartment. I don't know why they won't let him sit up here with me. He's a lot better behaved than most of the dregs you find onboard here. Do you, do you have any pets? 

JERRY

Uh, just my next door neighbor. 

GAVIN

You're missing out on a relationship that could enrich your life in ways that you never could have thought possible. 

JERRY

Howbout picking up their, you know. You find that enriching? 

JERRY

What's the matter? 

GAVIN

Oh, I'm feeling a bit queasy. 

GAVIN

My dog. What about my dog? 

GAVIN

Jerry? 

JERRY

Huh? How you feeling? 

GAVIN

Would you take care of Farfel? 

JERRY

Farfel? 

JERRY

The dog? The dog?? 

GAVIN

I'm sure it's only for a day or two. 

JERRY

But, you know, what if, you know? 

GAVIN

Give me your address and phone number, I'll call you. 

JERRY

The dog? 

JERRY

Let go, Farfel! Let go, gimme that! Gimme the sneaker you stupid idiot! Shut up! (to Elaine) So what would you do? 

ELAINE

Well it's only been three days, I'm sure he's gonna call. 

JERRY

STOP IT! SHUT UUUUUUP!!! (to Elaine) Do you believe this? Do you believe what I'm dealing with here, I've got a wild animal in the house! He's deranged, maybe he's got rabies. I can get lockjaw. 

ELAINE

If only. 

JERRY

Look at this place. He's going everywhere, I can't go out of the house at night. I haven't performed in three days. This'll be my first night out of the house since I got back. 

ELAINE

Hey, when you walk him, do ya... 

JERRY

Do I what? 

ELAINE

Do you pick it up? 

JERRY

Yes, I pick it up. 

ELAINE

You pick it up?!? 

JERRY

Well you have to. 

ELAINE

Oh, boy would I love to see that. 

JERRY

SHUT UP!! Shut up Farfel, stop it! (to Elaine) I don't know what to do. I mean what if I take it to the pound then the guy shows up? 

ELAINE

Maybe you should call the airline, they might know where he is. 

JERRY

No, I tried. they don't know anything. (notices Elaine making egg creams) You gotta put the syrup in first. 

ELAINE

No, milk. 

JERRY

I'm telling you the guy's a drunk, he's probably on a bender. 

ELAINE

What is a bender anyhow? 

JERRY

I don't know, they drink and they bend things at the bar. 

ELAINE

I can't believe he hasn't called. 

JERRY

Two hundred seats on a plane, I gotta wind up next to Yukon Jack and his dog Cujo. Shut up! One more day and you are pound bound! 

KRAMER

Sorry, I can't watch the dog tonight. 

JERRY

Why? 

ELAINE

We're going to the movies, we're gonna see Prognosis Negative. 

KRAMER

I can't, I gotta get this Ellen out of my life. 

JERRY

You're breaking up? 

KRAMER

Oh ho ho ho yeah, the sooner the better. I can't wait to do it. You know how there's some people you worry about whether you're going to hurt their feelings? With her, I'm looking forward to it. I'd like to get it on video, watch it in slow motion and freeze frame it. Oh ho, yeah. 

ELAINE

Kramer, I don't know how you lasted as long as you did. 

KRAMER

Woah, you didn't like her? 

ELAINE

If you could see her personality it would be like one of the Elephant Man exhibits, you know where they pull off the sheet and everyone gasps. 

JERRY

I can't believe someone hasn't killed her yet. 

KRAMER

How come you never said anything? 

JERRY

Well you can't tell someone how you feel about their girlfriend until after they stop seeing them. 

KRAMER

I tell you. 

JERRY

You. I'm talking about people. 

ELAINE

Are we still going to the movies tonight? 

JERRY

No, I can't I gotta watch Farfel, you and George can go without me. 

ELAINE

Just me and George? 

JERRY

Sure. 

ELAINE

But we need you. 

JERRY

What do you need me for? 

ELAINE

Because... Yeah? 

GEORGE

Prognosis Negative! (in a funny voice) 

ELAINE

Because I relate to George through you, we're like friends-in-law. Besides, you said we were gonna see Prognosis Negative together. Can't you just put some newspapers down or something? 

JERRY

No, I can't trust him, he gets insane. I won't enjoy myself. That's right, Farfel, I'm talking about you! 

ELAINE

Just me and George alone? 

GEORGE

Let's go, people, let's go! It's Prognosis Negative time, wa ha ha ha!!! 

JERRY

I can't go. 

GEORGE

Can't go, Why not? 

JERRY

Because I have to watch idiot Farfel. 

GEORGE

I thought Kramer was watching. 

JERRY

He's breaking up with his girlfriend tonight. 

GEORGE

Well so what's the problem, you just put some newspaper down. 

JERRY

No, I don't want that smell in the house. 

GEORGE

You spritz a little Lysol on it. 

JERRY

No, it's like BO and cologne, they combine forces into some kind of strange mutant funk. 

GEORGE

So we're not going? 

JERRY

Nah. You two go. 

GEORGE

Oh. You still wanna go? 

ELAINE

Do, do you? 

GEORGE

If you want. 

ELAINE

It,s, it's up to you. 

JERRY

Go ahead. 

ELAINE

Well, it's, I really wanted to see Prognosis Negative with Jerry, uh, you wanna see Ponce de Leon? 

GEORGE

Ponce de Leon? Okay. (to Jerry) You sure you don't wanna go? 

JERRY

I want to but I can't. 

ELAINE

Oh! I tell you what. How about if I come back here first and I clean everything up and I open up the windows and if you're still not satisfied we can switch apartments for the night. 

JERRY

No. 

GEORGE

What about this-- 

JERRY

Forget it. Go ahead, you'll have a good time. 

ELAINE

I know, it's not that. 

GEORGE

It's just we want you to go. 

JERRY

Well, thank you very much. I'm telling you, one more day stinkbreath! 

JERRY

On my block, a lot of ah, people walk their dogs, and I always see them walking along with their little poop bags, which to me is just the lowest function of human life. If aliens are watching this through telescopes, they're gonna think the dogs are the leaders. If you see two life forms, one of them's making a poop, the other one's carrying it for him, who would you assume was in charge? 

GEORGE

So how long did you live there? 

ELAINE

About three years. 

GEORGE

That's pretty long. 

ELAINE

Hmm. 

GEORGE

It's not that long, really. 

ELAINE

Yeah. 

GEORGE

And then you came here. 

ELAINE

Yeah. So I've been here about six years. 

GEORGE

Eighty-six, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, ninety, ninety-one... Yup. 

JERRY

Bad dog! Bad dog! You go outside! Outside!! What do you want from me? Tell me! Money, you want money? I'll give you money, how much?! 

KRAMER

I must have been out of my mind. Look at you. Why don't you do something with your life? Sit around here all day, you contribute nothing to society. You're just taking up space. How could I be with someone like you? Wouldn't respect myself. 

GEORGE

I like herbal tea. 

GEORGE

Chamomile's good. Lemon Lift. Almond Pleasure. 

ELAINE

Jerry likes Morning Thunder. 

GEORGE

Jerry drinks Morning Thunder? 

ELAINE

Yeah. 

GEORGE

Morning Thunder has caffeine in it, Jerry doesn't drink caffeine. 

ELAINE

Jerry doesn't know Morning Thunder has caffeine in it. 

GEORGE

You don't tell him? 

ELAINE

No. And you should see him, man, he gets all hyper, he doesn't even know why, he loves it! He walks around, going, 'God, I feel great!' 

GEORGE

You don't tell him? 

ELAINE

No. 

GEORGE

That is so funny! 

ELAINE

I know! 

GEORGE

Wait, have you ever seen him throw up?! 

KRAMER

Please! Please!! I take it all back, everything! I take it all back, every word! I love you! I love *you*! I can't live without you, I,ll, I'll do anything! 

JERRY

That's right, Gavin Palone. What? Are you sure? He was released on Monday? *Last* Monday? Did he leave a phone number or address? Unbelievable. Well thank you, thanks, thanks very much. (Hangs up) That's it, Farfel! Party's over! Start packing up your little squeeze toys buddy boy, you're checking out! 

ELAINE

It was weird because George and I get along so great in so many situations but this is the first time we ever really went one-on-one. 

JERRY

Oh, one-on-one's a whole different game. Can't pass off. 

ELAINE

The only time it wasn't uncomfortable was when we were making fun of you. 

JERRY

Going to the dog pound, everybody! Going to the dog pound, come on down. (To Elaine) What? 

ELAINE

Do you have to? 

JERRY

What am I supposed to do? I don't want to do it. I like dogs. I'm not sure this is a dog. 

ELAINE

You know, the guy might have just lost your number. 

JERRY

I'm in the book and I have a machine. 

ELAINE

Jerry, do you know what they do to dogs at the pound? They keep them there for a week and then if nobody claims them, they kill them. 

JERRY

Really? How late are they open? 

JERRY

What? 

ELAINE

What is it? 

KRAMER

I went back with Ellen. 

ELAINE

Ohhhhh, that's great. 

ELAINE

Terrific. 

JERRY

Yeah, I really think you guys are good together. 

ELAINE

Yes, she understands you and she is not demanding. 

KRAMER

Do you think that I forgot what you two said about her? 

JERRY

Well I was just trying to be supportive, you know. I knew you were upset. 

KRAMER

From now on when we pass each other in the hall, I don't know you, you don't know me. 

ELAINE

Oh, Kramer, we didn't mean it. 

JERRY

What are you doing? 

KRAMER

I'm getting my pot. 

ELAINE

Kramer, we like her. 

JERRY

Kramer? What did we say that's so bad? 

ELAINE

I believe I referred to her personality as a potential science exhibit. 

JERRY

I said, 'How come no one's killed her?' Probably shouldn't have said anything, 

JERRY

Well. 

ELAINE

Well. 

JERRY

everyone knows the first break-up never takes. (answers buzzer) Yeah? 

GEORGE

Prognosis Negative! (again in a funny voice) 

JERRY

Okay, Farfel, put your shoes on. 

ELAINE

Jerry, can't you just give it one more day, it's not his fault. 

JERRY

It's not my dog, I don't know where this boozehound is. 

ELAINE

Alright, I tell you what. How about if you and George go to the movies, and I stay here and watch the dog tonight. 

JERRY

I can't let you do that, what about Prognosis Negative? 

ELAINE

We'll see it Sunday. 

GEORGE

Tonight's the night, right? Prognosis Negative? 

ELAINE

I'm not going, I'm gonna watch the dog. 

GEORGE

What does this mean? 

JERRY

Well, we'll go see something else tonight. We'll see, uh, Ponce De Leon. 

GEORGE

What is with this dog, I thought we were taking it to the pound. 

JERRY

She talked me into one more day. Talk amongst yourselves, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. 

GEORGE

Uh Jerry, how long will you be in there? 

JERRY

I don't know, regular human time? 

GEORGE

Uh why don't you wait then go in the movies? 

JERRY

Why shouldn't I go here? 

ELAINE

Well, you know, I mean, sometimes it's good to get there and make sure you get your seats and then go to the bathroom. 

GEORGE

And isn't it more fun using the urinal? 

ELAINE

Yeah. 

JERRY

Oh yeah, urinals are fun. Can I go?! 

GEORGE

Hey, go. 

ELAINE

Who's stopping you? 

GEORGE

What, are you doing me a favor? 

ELAINE

Like we care if you go to the bathroom. 

GEORGE

How's it going? 

ELAINE

Good. Good. You? 

GEORGE

Things are good. 

ELAINE

Boy, he takes such a long time. 

GEORGE

I know. 

ELAINE

You know what he does in there? He gargles. 

GEORGE

Jerry gargles? Is that why he takes so long? 

ELAINE

Yeah, he does it like six times a day. 

GEORGE

How come we never hear him? 

ELAINE

Because he does it quiet. He does it quiet. Lookit, Just like this, watch. 

GEORGE

Wait, wait, did you ever see him throw up?! 

ELAINE

We talked about that already. 

GEORGE

Oh. 

GEORGE

I have nothing to say to anybody. I'm so uninteresting. I think I'm out of conversation. 

JERRY

So what are calling me six times a day? 

GEORGE

All I know about is sports. That's it. No matter how depressed I get, I could always read the sports section. 

JERRY

I could read the sports section if my hair was on fire. 

GEORGE

Know what? Ponce De Leon is sold out. 

JERRY

It is? Oh yeah, you're right. What else is playing? 

GEORGE

Nothing except Prognosis Negative. 

JERRY

Boy, I know she really wants to see that with me. 

ELAINE

Gimme the jacket, furface, this is not Seinfeld you're dealing with! When I get through with you, you'll be begging to go to the pound! 

ELAINE

Shut up. Shut up! (Answers phone) Hello? No, who's calling? Oh my god, the dog guy. Where have *you* been? Yeah, well you better pick up your dog tonight or he has humped his last leg. 

GEORGE

I mean, I could understand if there was something else playing, but it's this or nothing. 

JERRY

I don't know what to do. 

GEORGE

What is this 'saving movies' thing? Something's playing, you go. 

JERRY

I know, I know. 

GEORGE

So, what? We're gonna do nothing now, this is crazy. 

JERRY

It is kind of silly. 

GEORGE

Of course it is. 

JERRY

I mean, it's just a movie, for god's sake. 

GEORGE

Exactly. 

JERRY

It's not like she's *in* the movie. 

GEORGE

Right. 

JERRY

Am I supposed to ruin the whole night because she wants to see it? I mean, if I could have seen it with her, fine. But I can't control all these circumstances and schedules and peoples' availabilities at movies. 

GEORGE

And she'll still see it, you're not stopping her from seeing it. 

JERRY

How does sitting next to a person in a movie theater increase the level of enjoyment? You can't talk during a movie. You know, this is stupid, c'mon, let's just go. 

GEORGE

Good. 

JERRY

Saving movies. 

GEORGE

Ridiculous! 

JERRY

Two for Prognosis Negative. I'm in big trouble. 

GEORGE

Oh, you're dead. 

GAVIN

Bell's Palsy. The entire side of my, of, of my face was paralyzed. Farfel! I couldn't, I couldn't, I couldn't even feed myself, I was completely incapacitated. Quiet Farfel! 

JERRY

You know it's interesting, because I called the hospital and they said you were released on Monday. 

GAVIN

Yes, yes, that's true, but then I was taken to the Bell's Palsy Center in, in, in, in Rockford. Absolutely first, first rate facility, top notch physicians. 

KRAMER

Hey, c'mon, c'mon, get off me! 

GAVIN

He won't hurt you, he's just playing. 

KRAMER

Hey you keep that mutt away from me. 

GAVIN

Mutt? I'll wager his parents are more pure than yours. 

ELLEN

Kramer, are you coming? 

JERRY

Oh, hi Ellen. 

ELLEN

Get in here. 

JERRY

Listen, it's really been a pleasure taking care of your dog for a week, but if you don't mind... 

GAVIN

Pre-prediction. You'll be calling me to ask if you can come and visit him before the month is out. 

JERRY

Prediction. I never see you or him again for the rest of my life. 

ELAINE

We made plans. 

JERRY

Why don't we just rent a movie? 

ELAINE

I thought you wanted to see Prognosis Negative. 

JERRY

No, it&Mac226;s, it's supposed to be really bad, *really* bad. I mean it's long, there's no story, it's so unbelievably boring, I heard. i... 

ELAINE

Jerry, you promised me we'd go. 

JERRY

Well, George told me the whole story, line for line, I mean I almost feel like I've seen it already and walked out on it. 

ELAINE

Wait, George saw the movie? I saw him yesterday, he didn't mention it. 

JERRY

You and George got together? 

ELAINE

Yeah, I wanted to talk about how we have nothing to talk about. 

JERRY

Hello. 

KRAMER

Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi. 

JERRY

What's up? 

KRAMER

Well, ah you were right. 

JERRY

About what? 

KRAMER

Ellen. We, uh, broke up again. 

JERRY

Too bad. 

ELAINE

I thought she was the one. 

KRAMER

I'll bring back the pot. 

ELAINE

Okay, c'mon it's movie time. 

KRAMER

Hey, what are you gonna see? 

JERRY

Prognosis Negative. 

KRAMER

Hey, that's supposed to be great. 

JERRY

It's not. 

KRAMER

How do you know? 

JERRY

I have an instinct for these things. 

JERRY

I had a parakeet when I was a kid, that was the only pet that I really enjoyed. We used to let him out of his cage, and he would fly around and my mother had built, one entire wall of our living room was mirrored. She felt this gives you a feeling of space. Have you ever heard this interior design principle that a mirror makes it seem like you have an entire other room? What kind of a jerk walks up to a mirror and goes, 'Hey look, there's a whole nother room in there. There's a guy in there looks just like me.' But the parakeet will fall for this, you'll let him out of his cage, he flies around the room, BANG! With his little head, he would just go 'click' Ohh! And I'd always think, even if he thinks the mirror is another room, why doesn't he at least try to avoid hitting the other parakeet? 

JERRY

Let me speak with the head librarian. ... Because it's absurd. An overdue book from 1971? ... This is a joke right? What are you? From a radio station? 

KRAMER

enters 

JERRY

Ya' got me I fell for it. Alright, OK I can be down there in like a half hour. Bye. 

KRAMER

What's the problem? 

JERRY

This you're not goin' to believe. The NYPL says that I took out Tropic of Cancer in 1971 and never returned it. 

KRAMER

Do you know how much that comes to? That's a nickel a day for 20 years. It's going to be $50,000 

JERRY

It doesn't work like that. 

KRAMER

If it's a dime a day it could be $100,000 

JERRY

It's not going to be anything. I returned the book. I remember it very vividly because I was with Sherry Becker. She wore this orange dress. It was the first time I ever saw her in a dress like that. In oticed since ninth grade she was developing this body in secret under these loose clothes for like two years. And then one day ... 

JERRY

That orange dress is burned in my memory 

KRAMER

Oh, memory burn. 

JERRY

I wonder what ever happened to her. 

KRAMER

How did they ever find you? 

JERRY

Oh, computers, they're cracking down now on overdue books. The whole thing is completely ridiculous. 

JERRY

It's George. Wait 'til he hears we're going to the library 

KRAMER

You know I never got a library card. 

JERRY

(to speaker) Coming down. 

KRAMER

It's all a bunch of cheapskates in there anyway. People sitting around reading the newspaper attached to huge wooden sticks Trying to save a quarter, ooh, 

JERRY

I gotta go to the library. You want to go? 

KRAMER

Yeah, 

KRAMER

The Dewey Decimal System, what a scam that was. Boy that Dewey guy really cleaned up on that deal. 

JERRY

Where's George 

READER

Shhh. 

KRAMER

Tryin' to save a quarter. 

JERRY

I kinda like those sticks. I'd like to get them in my house. 

JERRY

This woman's completely ignoring me. 

KRAMER

Look at her. This is a lonely woman looking for companionship.. ... Spinster. ... Maybe a virgin. ... Maybe she got hurt a long time ago. She was a schoolgirl. There was a boy It didn't work out. Now she needs a little tenderness. She needs a little understanding. She needs a little Kramer. 

JERRY

Eventually a little shot of penicillin 

LIBRARIAN

Yes? 

JERRY

Yeah I called before. I got his notice in the mail. 

LIBRARIAN

Oh, Tropic of Cancer, Henry Miller, Uh, this case has been turned over to our library investigation officer Mr. Bookman. 

KRAMER

Bookman? The library investigator's name is actually, Bookman? 

LIBRARIAN

It's true. 

KRAMER

That's amazing. That's like an ice cream man named, Cone. 

LIBRARIAN

Lt. Bookman has been working here for 25 years so I think he's heard all the jokes. 

JERRY

Can I speak with this Bookman? 

LIBRARIAN

Just a second. 

GEORGE

Jerry, Jerry 

JERRY

What? 

GEORGE

I think I saw him. I think it's him. 

JERRY

Who? 

GEORGE

Did you see the homeless guy on the library steps screaming obsenities and doing some calesthetics routine 

JERRY

Yeah. 

KRAMER

yeah 

GEORGE

I think that's Mr. Hayman. ...The gym teacher from our High School. 

READER

Shhh. 

JERRY

(whispers) Haymen, Are you sure? 

GEORGE

He's older, completely covered in filth, no whistle, but I think it's him. 

JERRY

George got him fired. He squealed on him. 

KRAMER

Ooh tattle tale 

GEORGE

(yells) I didn't tattle 

READER

Shh Shh 

KRAMER

What did this guy do? What happened? 

GEORGE

There was an incident. I'd rather not discuss it. 

KRAMER

Oh come on, You can tell me. 

GEORGE

Some other time. 

KRAMER

What tonight? 

KRAMER

Y'know I never figured you for a squealer. 

JERRY

Oh, he sang like a canary. 

LIBRARIAN

Mr. Bookman's not here. 

JERRY

Not here? Why was I told to come down here? 

LIBRARIAN

He'll be out all afternoon on a case. 

KRAMER

He's out on a case? He actually goes out on cases? 

JERRY

Well what am I supposed to do now? 

LIBRARIAN

I'll have Mr. Bookman get in touch with you. 

JERRY

All right Thanks. Come on lets go 

GEORGE

Let's see if it's Hayman? 

KRAMER

Hey, uh, I'll see you boys later. (TURNS TO LIBRARIAN) So uh, what's a guy got to do around here to get a library card? 

ELAINE

Where's Karen? 

SECRETARY

She went to pick up lunch. 

ELAINE

Well, she didn't ask me what I wanted. 

SECRETARY

She must have forgot. 

ELAINE

How could she forget I've been ordering lunch every day here for 3 and a half years? 

SECRETARY

I don't know anything. 

ELAINE

Ah, you don't know anything. You see, 'I don't know anything', means there's something to know. If you really didn't know anything you would have said 'You're crazy.' 

ELAINE

Oh, hi Mr. Lippman. 

LIPPMAN

Elaine, 

ELAINE

Um, uh, I was wondering if you got a chance to look at that , um, biography of Columbus, I gave you? 

LIPPMAN

Yes I did. Yes I did. ... Maureen this water is still too cold. 

ELAINE

Ooh yeah, It's freezing. ... Hurts your teeth. 

ELAINE

I'm tellin' ya' somethin' is goin' on. He never likes anything I recommend. And then that lunch thing. 

JERRY

So they forgot to get your lunch. Big deal! 

ELAINE

What do you know. You've never worked in an office. (TURNS TO GEORGE) See, George, you've worked in an office. Jerry thinks I'm over reacting but you understand, ... LUNCH! 

GEORGE

I don't understand lunch, I don't know anything about lunch. Listen. Just because I got the guy fired doesn't mean I turned him into a bum - does it? 

ELAINE

What did he do? 

GEORGE

He purposely mispronounced my name. Instead of saying, 'Costanza' He'd say, 'Can't stand ja'. 'Can't stand ja' ... He made me smell my own gym socks once. 

JERRY

I remember he made you wear a jock on your head for a whole class. And the straps were hangin' down by his ,... 

GEORGE

OK, OK, I never even had him for gym. 

JERRY

I had him for Hygene. Remember his teeth. It was like from an exhumed corpse. 

GEORGE

Little baked beans 

JERRY

Echh 

ELAINE

Come on tell me what happened. 

GEORGE

Well, OK. As I said the guy had it in for me. He actually failed me in gym. ... ME! 

GEORGE

... Those spastic shnitzer twins ... 

HEYMAN

Can't stand ja ... Can't stand ja 

GEORGE

Yes, Mr. Hayman 

HEYMAN

Your underwear was stick'n out of your shorts during gym class. 

GEORGE

Well I guess that's because I wear boxer shorts. 

HEYMAN

Boxer shorts, ha ha, Well what brand? 

GEORGE

I'm not really sure, I... 

HEYMAN

Well let's take a look. 

GEORGE

He gave me a wedgie. 

JERRY

He got fired the next day. 

ELAINE

Why do they call it a wedgie? 

GEORGE

Because the underwear is pulled up from the back and ... it wedges in.. 

JERRY

They also have an atomic wedgie. Now the goal there is to actually get the waistband on top of the head. Very rare. 

ELAINE

Boys are sick. 

JERRY

Well what do girls do ? 

ELAINE

We just tease some one 'til they develop an eating disorder. guy who ruined his life. 

GEORGE

I gotta go back to the library and talk to him. I gotta find out if I&Mac226;m the guy who ruined his life. 

KRAMER

Hey Babaloo, you better get home. You know this guy Bookman from the library he's waiting for ya. 

JERRY

What's amazing to me about the library is it's a place where you go in you can take out any book you whant they just give it to you and say bring it back when you're done. It reminds me of like this pathetic friend that everbody had when they were a little kid who would let you borrow any of his stuff if you would just be his friend. That's what the library is. A government funded pathetic friend. And that's why everybody kinds of bullies the library. I'll bring it back on time ... I'll bring it back late. ... Oh, what are you going to do? Charge me a nickel? 

JERRY

Oh, I'm glad you're here, so we can get this all straightened out. Would you like a cup of tea? 

BOOKMAN

You got any coffee? 

JERRY

Coffee? 

BOOKMAN

Yeah. Coffee. 

JERRY

No, I don't drink coffee. 

BOOKMAN

Yeah, you don't drink coffee? How about instant coffee? 

JERRY

No, I don't have-- 

BOOKMAN

You don't have any instant coffee? 

JERRY

Well, I don't normally-- 

BOOKMAN

Who doesn't have instant coffee? 

JERRY

I don't. 

BOOKMAN

You buy a jar of Folger's Crystals, you put it in the cupboard, you forget about it. Then later on when you need it, it's there. It lasts forever. It's freeze-dried. Freeze-dried Crystals. 

JERRY

Really? I'll have to remember that. 

BOOKMAN

You took this book out in 1971. 

JERRY

Yes, and I returned it in 1971. 

BOOKMAN

Yeah, '71. That was my first year on the job. Bad year for libraries. Bad year for America. Hippies burning library cards, Abby Hoffman telling everybody to steal books. I don't judge a man by the length of his hair or the kind of music he listens to. Rock was never my bag. But you put on a pair of shoes when you walk into the New York Public Library, fella. 

JERRY

Look, Mr. Bookman. I--I returned that book. I remember it very specifically. 

BOOKMAN

You're a comedian, you make people laugh. 

JERRY

I try. 

BOOKMAN

You think this is all a big joke, don't you? 

JERRY

No, I don't. 

BOOKMAN

I saw you on T.V. once; I remembered your name--from my list. I looked it up. Sure enough, it checked out. You think because you're a celebrity that somehow the law doesn't apply to you, that you're above the law? 

JERRY

Certainly not. 

BOOKMAN

Well, let me tell you something, funny boy. Y'know that little stamp, the one that says 'New York Public Library'? Well that may not mean anything to you, but that means a lot to me. One whole hell of a lot. Sure, go ahead, laugh if you want to. I've seen your type before: Flashy, making the scene, flaunting convention. Yeah, I know what you're thinking. What's this guy making such a big stink about old library books? Well, let me give you a hint, junior. Maybe we can live without libraries, people like you and me. Maybe. Sure, we're too old to change the world, but what about that kid, sitting down, opening a book, right now, in a branch at the local library and finding drawings of pee-pees and wee-wees on the Cat in the Hat and the Five Chinese Brothers? Doesn't HE deserve better? Look. If you think this is about overdue fines and missing books, you'd better think again. This is about that kid's right to read a book without getting his mind warped! Or: maybe that turns you on, Seinfeld; maybe that's how y'get your kicks. You and your good-time buddies. Well I got a flash for ya, joy-boy: Party time is over. Y'got seven days, Seinfeld. That is one week! 

KRAMER

What's wrong? 

MARION

It's Bookman the library cop. 

KRAMER

So I, I didn't do anything wrong. 

MARION

I'm supposed to be at work. I could get fired. I shouldn't have come here. 

KRAMER

Why don't ya' leave? 

MARION

I can't. 

JERRY

No way I'm payin' that! I returned that book in 1971. I have a witness Sherry Becker. She wore an orange dress. She gave me a piece of black jack gum. It's a licorice gum. What do ya' think of next I remember it. (thinks out loud, opens phone book) Becker, ... Becker, ... 

SHERRY

Kevin went to a public school, he's the 14 year old? We were gonna' send Marsha to a private school. Cause in some way they don't learn ... enough ... I think. 

JERRY

So Sherry, what do you remember about that day at the library? 

SHERRY

I remember it like it was yesterday. It was a Friday afternoon. I wore a purple dress. 

JERRY

Purple? Ya' sure it wasn't orange? 

SHERRY

Positive. And I was chewin' Dentyne. I always chewed dentyne. Remember Jerry? Dentyne? 

JERRY

No Black Jack? 

SHERRY

Uch! Licorice gum? Never! We were ah, reading pasages to each other from that Henry Miller book, 

JERRY

Tropic of Cancer. 

SHERRY

No, Tropic of Capricorn 

JERRY

Tropic of Capricorn? 

SHERRY

Rememba? What holds the world togetha' ... 'As I have learned from bitter experience is sexual intercourse .' 

JERRY

Wait a second. Wait a second. You're right. I had both of them. 

JERRY

George, here's the book. Don't let anybody see it. Don't let anything happen to it. 

GEORGE

Jerry, it's me, George, don't worry, I'll return it 

JERRY

Ok, I'll see you after school. I.m late for Hayman's hygiene. 

SHERRY

Where ya' going? 

JERRY

It was nice seeing you again. I just remembered something. I've got to go. (to old man that enters) It was GEORGE! 

KRAMER

Read another poem. 

MARION

Pressed chest fleshed out west Might be the saviour or a garden pest. 

KRAMER

Wow, that is great. You should be published. 

KRAMER

You know, the library is kind of a cool place when it's closed. 

MARIAN

Oh, yeah. You don't have to be quiet. Listen to the echo: HELLO! 

KRAMER

HELLO! 

MARIAN

HELLO! 

KRAMER

HELLO! 

MARIAN

HELLO! 

BOOKMAN

Hello! 

MARIAN

Mr. Bookman. 

BOOKMAN

I remember when the librarian was a much older woman: Kindly, discreet, unattractive. We didn't know anything about her private life. We didn't want to know anything about her private life. She didn't have a private life. While you're thinking about that, think about this: The library closes at five o'clock, no exceptions. This is your final warning. Got that, kewpie-doll? 

ELAINE

Lippman want's to see me in his office SEE ME! That can't be good 

JERRY

Maybe you're getting' a raise. 

ELAINE

Maybe I'm getting' a wedgie. 

ELAINE

What? 

GEORGE

It's George 

ELAINE

George is on his way up. 

JERRY

Wait 'til I tell him about the book. 

KRAMER

(reading) sobs 

ELAINE

Are you OK? What? What? 

KRAMER

It's Marion's poetry. I can't take it (leaves sobbing) 

ELAINE

Remember that biography I recommended? MY BOSS HATED IT 

JERRY

I'm right here. 

ELAINE

Remember that Columbus book? 

JERRY

Columbus, Euro trash. 

GEORGE

Well, it's definetly him. 

ELAINE

Him? Him who? 

GEORGE

Him who? Hayman him. 

ELAINE

Hayman The gym teacher? You found him? 

GEORGE

Oh, I found him. He was sitting on the steps of the library. I sat down next to him. He smelled like the locker room after that game against Erasmus 

JERRY

That was double overtime. 

GEORGE

So I said, 'Mr. Hayman, It's me george Costanza, JFK, ... ' He doesn't move. So I said uh, 'Can't stand ya'', 'Can't stand ya'' He turns and smiles, the little baked bean teeth. I get up to run away, but something was holding me back. It was Heyman. He had my underwear. There I was on the steps of the 42nd St. library , a grown man, getting a wedgie. 

ELAINE

At least it wasn't atomic. 

GEORGE

It was. 

JERRY

So Georgie Boy, guess what happened to TROPIC OF CANCER 

GEORGE

How should I know? 

JERRY

Because I gave it to you. 

GEORGE

Me? 

JERRY

Yeah, think. Don't you remember you kept begging me to see it then finally I agreed. You were supposed to return it. I met you in the gym locker room. 

GEORGE

The locker room! 

JERRY

Here's the book. Don't let anybody see it. Don't let anything happen to it. 

GEORGE

Jerry, it's me, George, don't worry, I'll return it tomorrow, no problem. 

JERRY

All right, I'll see you after school. I,,m late for Hayman's hygiene. 

HEYMAN

Can't Stand Ya'. 

GEORGE

Yes Mr. Hayman. 

HEYMAN

Your underwear was stick'n out of your shorts during gym class. 

GEORGE

Well I guess that's because I wear boxer shorts. 

HEYMAN

Boxer shorts, ha? Well what brand? 

GEORGE

I'm not really sure, I... 

HEYMAN

Well let's take a look. 

GEORGE

(shouting) No No No! 

JERRY

Anyway, I hope there's no hard feelings. 

BOOKMAN

Hard feelings? What do you know about hard feelings? Y'ever have a man die in your arms? Y'ever kill somebody? 

JERRY

What is your problem? 

BOOKMAN

What's my problem? Punks like you, that's my problem. And you better not screw up again Seinfeld, because if you do, I'll be all over you like a pitbull on a poodle. 

JERRY

(after Bookman exits): That is one tough monkey! (turns to Elaine) So you were saying? 

ELAINE

Oh? So, I took your suggestion and I gave my boss Marion's poems. The ones that affected Kramer so much. 

JERRY

Oh, beautiful did he like them? 

ELAINE

No, ... he didn't! No, ... he didn't! 

JERRY

(to George) Was he out there? 

GEORGE

Na, he's gone. I wonder what happened to him. 

JERRY

I guess we'll never know. 

HEYMAN

Can't stand ya, (laughing) Can't stand ya. (pan to TROPIC OF CANCER on ground) 

JERRY

Any day that you had gym it was a weird school day, you know what I mean because it kind of like started of kind of normal. You have like English, Geometry, Social Studies and then suddenly you're like in Lord of The Flies for 40 minutes you know you're hangin' from a rope. You have hardly any clothes on. Teachers are yellin' at ya' 'Where's your jock strap?' Ya' know and kids are throwin' dodge balls at you. You're tryin' to survive ... Then its History, Science, Language. There's something off in the entire flow of that day. 

FILE

GEORGE, JERRY AND ELAINE, WHO'S CARRYING A PLASTIC BAG WITH GOLDFISH, AND KRAMER WHO'S HAVING A ROUGH TIME WITH A LARGE, HEAVY BOX.] 

GEORGE

One left...what a joke. 

KRAMER

You can have this one. 

GEORGE

No, that's not enough BTUs for my living room...That was a complete waste of time. 

ELAINE

Hey, I didn't get one either. 

JERRY

Why do I always have the feeling that everybody's doing something better than me on Saturday afternoons? 

ELAINE

This is what people do. 

JERRY

No they don't. They're out on some big picnic. They're cooking burgers. They're making out on blankets. They're not at some mall in Jersey watching their friends trying to find the world's cheapest air-conditioner. 

GEORGE

You should see what my father used to go through before he bought a car. He'd go from state to state. He was away for weeks at a time. It was like he was running for President and he was going through the primaries. We'd get phone calls from motels in New Hampshire. 

ELAINE

So we took a little ride. What's the big deal? 

GEORGE

Well at least you accomplished something. You got fish. 

JERRY

Big accomplishment. 

GEORGE

Fish. What do they do? 

ELAINE

What do you do? 

KRAMER

It's this way. 

GEORGE

What time is it? 

JERRY

Five o'clock. 

GEORGE

Always late. Always late. 

JERRY

You're not late. 

GEORGE

I told them to meet me in front of my building at six-fifteen. 

ELAINE

Who? 

GEORGE

My parents. It's their anniversary. I'm taking them out to dinner and a show tonight. You think we'll hit traffic? 

JERRY

Of course we'll hit traffic. It's rush hour. 

ELAINE

Isn't it going the other way? 

JERRY

There is no other way in New York. Everybody goes every way all the time. 

ELAINE

But it's Saturday. 

JERRY

You got the picnic and burger traffic. 

GEORGE

I always get myself in this position. Can't be on time. Gotta rush. 

ELAINE

What's the matter? 

JERRY

I have to go to the bathroom. Why do they hide the bathroom in these malls? 

JERRY

(CONT'D) You want me to help you with that? 

KRAMER

No, no, I got it. 

JERRY

(TO GEORGE, RE:WOMAN) What do you think, Georgie boy? 

GEORGE

Did I need that pointed out for me? What is that going to do for me? How does that help me, to see her? I'm trying to live my life. Don't show me that. 

KRAMER

If you like her, go talk to her. 

GEORGE

Yeah, right. I'll just go up and say, 'Hi, how ya' doing? Would you like a glass of white wine?' JERRY Before you got within twenty feet of this woman, she'd have her finger on the mace button. She's like an expensive car with one of those motion-sensor force field alarms. Any sudden movement in the area could set her off. 

KRAMER

She's fat. 

ELAINE

Oh she's fat? 

ELAINE

What? JERRY Where's the car? 

KRAMER

I thought it was here. 

GEORGE

You don't know where we parked? 

GEORGE

Oh, this is great. 

KRAMER

Blue-one. I thought it was blue-one. 

JERRY

I thought it was green. I remember seeing green. 

ELAINE

I didn't pay attention. 

GEORGE

This is just what I need. 

ELAINE

I'm sure it's right around here. 

KRAMER

It looks familiar. I remember the elevator. 

GEORGE

There's elevators all over! It all looks the same. 

JERRY

It's over there. I know where it is. 

ELAINE

It's black, right? 

KRAMER

Dark blue. 

GEORGE

(MUMBLING) You come to a parking lot, you write it down. How hard is that? 

JERRY

There it is!...No, no that's a Toyota. 

JERRY

(CONT'D) Hmmm...I thought it was... 

KRAMER

Didn't we come in over there? 

JERRY

I thought it was over there. 

ELAINE

How long can fish live in one of these plastic bags? 

KRAMER

About two hours. 

ELAINE

(SHE LOOKS AT HER WATCH) You'd better find this car. 

GEORGE

It's this way... AND THEY TAKE OFF AGAIN, PAIRING OFF: 

JERRY

I really have to go to the bathroom. 

KRAMER

Why don't you go behind one of these cars? J 

KRAMER

(CONT'D) Why? Nobody's around. 

JERRY

I'll wait. 

KRAMER

You know when you hold it in like that you can cause a lot of damage to your bladder. That's what happens to truck drivers. They hold it in all the time. Eventually it starts coming out involuntarily. 

JERRY

Alright. 

KRAMER

Jerry, are you aware that adult diapers are a six hundred million dollar a year industry? 

JERRY

Maybe I should just go anytime I get the urge like you...wherever I am. There's too much urinary freedom in this society. I'm proud to hold it in. It builds character. 

ELAINE

(RE: CAR) There it is!...No that's not it. 

ELAINE

(CONT'D) Hey, watch it. ...Did you see that car? Maniac. Can you explain something to me? I got six questions wrong on my drivers test. That's the maximum. I read the book, I'm a college graduate. This is a country where fifty percent of its high school students can't locate Europe on a map. How are they all passing that test? It's a mystery. 

GEORGE

...Six wrong? 

ELAINE

Those school zones are a killer. 

JERRY

(TO KRAMER, RE:BOX) Will you let me help you with that? 

KRAMER

I'm gonna put it down behind that car. 

JERRY

You're not worried somebody's gonna pee on it? 

KRAMER

(TO GEORGE) Pink eleven. Remember that. 

GEORGE

Oh I got it. (TO JERRY) That I'm supposed to remember. Where the car is, that's insignificant. 

ELAINE

(LOOKING AT FISH) I think they're laboring. 

KRAMER

Look at this place. It's huge... 

GEORGE

I can tell you this. If I am not in front of my house at six-fifteen, when my parents get there, they will put me on an aggravation installment plan that will compound with interest for decades. 

JERRY

Parents never forget a foul-up. I once left a jacket on the bus when I was fourteen. Last week I'm flying to Chicago to do a show, 'Make sure you hang on to your jacket.' 

GEORGE

Where the hell is this car, Kramer? 

KRAMER

It's got to be here. 

ELAINE

Why are they using so many colors? And the numbers go up to forty. 

JERRY

Maybe it's not on this level. 

GEORGE

What? 

JERRY

There are four different levels. Maybe we're on the wrong level. How long was the escalator ride up? 

ELAINE

It felt like a couple of levels. 

JERRY

You should always carry a pad and pen. 

GEORGE

I can't carry a pen. I'm afraid I'll puncture my scrotum. 

KRAMER

I have a pen. 

JERRY

Where was the bathroom in this mall? There are six-hundred stores, I didn't see one bathroom. What is this, like a joke? They finished building the mall and they go, 'Oh my god, we forgot the bathrooms.' 

MOTHER

(O.C.) Don't you dare talk to me like that! You hear me? 

ELAINE

Look at that woman. 

MOTHER

I told you! I don't care! You'll have to wait. 

GEORGE

(TO WOMAN) Hey, is that necessary? 

MOTHER

(TO GEORGE) Why don't you mind your own business? 

GEORGE

I think hitting a defenseless child is my business. 

KID

(TO GEORGE) You're ugly. 

GEORGE

...What? 

KID

You're ugly. 

GEORGE

You are! 

KID

You are! 

GEORGE

I should've hit the little son-of-a-bitch. I can't stand kids. Adults think it's so wonderful how honest kids are. I don't need that kind of honesty. I'll take a deceptive adult over an honest kid any day. 

KRAMER

(RE: CAR) I found it! 

ELAINE

He's got it. 

KRAMER

Oh...no. 

JERRY

All right, that's it. From now on no more calling out they found it, unless we're sitting in it. Okay? 

ELAINE

Jerry, look at my fish. 

JERRY

His eyes look a little cloudy. 

GEORGE

Oh are they gonna be furious. 

JERRY

Who's got the tickets? GEORGE I do. (TO KRAMER) I thought you knew this mall. You said you'd been here before! 

KRAMER

It was easy the last time. 

ELAINE

My fish are dying right in front of me! We have to get someone to drive us around the parking lot to help us look for the car. 

JERRY

No one's going to do that. 

ELAINE

Excuse me, we can't seem to find our car. I was wondering if it would be possible if you're not in a hurry, to drive us around the garage for five minutes so we can look. 

ELAINE

Five minutes. 

ELAINE

We're not wilding. 

ELAINE

(CONT'D) Excuse me - I can't seem to find my car - do you think you could drive me... 

ELAINE

(CONT'D) Oh that's funny? Is that funny? Well tell me if you think this is funny: These fish are dying! They're gasping for oxygen right now! They'll be floating in an hour. Is that funny too? 

JERRY

Those are really ugly sneakers. Where did you get those? 

KRAMER

Right here at the mall. 

ELAINE

Excuse me... 

ELAINE

(CONT'D) Sorry to have disturbed you. Terribly sorry. But the fish will be dead. You do know that. They can't live in plastic. That's not me talking, that's science. 

JERRY

It's amazing how shopping makes me have to go. All I have to do is walk into a department store and it's like some kind of horse laxative just kicked in. 

KRAMER

You drank a whole bottle of water. 

JERRY

I know. 

KRAMER

So why don't you just go? 

JERRY

No I can't. 

KRAMER

Don't you get tired of following rules? 

JERRY

You think I'm too cautious? 

KRAMER

Why be uncomfortable if you don't have to? It's organic. 

JERRY

Organic. So's Buddy Hackett. 

KRAMER

Buddy Hackett? 

JERRY

He's a comedian. 

KRAMER

I know. 

JERRY

All right. All right. 

KRAMER

(pointing) You can go over here. 

JERRY

I can manage. 

KRAMER

(turns away and spots George) George! (leaves scene) 

KRAMER

It'll take you ten seconds. 

JERRY

Okay, okay. I'll be right back. 

GUARD

Okay, let's go. Come with me. 

JERRY

But... 

GUARD

Come on. 

JERRY

(STARTS TO LEAVE, TO HIMSELF) ...Kramer 

JERRY

I've had this condition since I was eleven! I've been in and out of hospitals my whole life. I have no control over it. Doctors have told me that when I feel it, the best thing to do is just release it. Otherwise, I could die. 

GUARD

Well you're still not allowed. 

JERRY

Do you hear what I'm saying to you?! I'm telling you that if I don't go, I could die. Die. Is it worth dying for? 

GUARD

That's up to you. 

JERRY

So you don't care if I die. 

GUARD

What I care about is the sanitary condition of the parking facility. 

JERRY

It was life and death. 

GUARD

Uh huh. 

JERRY

Oh I'm lying. Why would I do it unless I was in mortal danger? I know it's against the law. 

GUARD

I don't know. 

JERRY

Because I could get Uromysitisis poisoning and die. That's why!...Do you think I enjoy living like this?...the shame, the humiliation...You know I have been issued a public urination pass by the city because of my condition. Unfortunately my little brother ran out of the house with it this morning. 

JERRY

(C0NT'D) Him and his friends are probably peeing all over the place. You want to call the Department of Social Services? Oh, it's Saturday. They're closed today. My luck. 

GUARD

You can tell the police all about it. 

KRAMER

(CALLING OUT) Jerry! 

ELAINE

Jerry! 

GEORGE

Unbelievable, I'm never gonna get out of here. The guy goes to pee, he never comes back. It's like a science fiction story. 

ELAINE

Maybe he went to one of the other levels. I'll go look for him. 

GEORGE

Oh now you're gonna go? ELAINE I'll be back in five minutes. 

GEORGE

If you go now, I know what's gonna happen. We'll find the car, Jerry will show up, and then we'll never find you. 

ELAINE

No, no, I'll be back. 

GEORGE

Oh what's the difference? We'll all be dead eventually. 

KRAMER

Does that bother you? 

GEORGE

Yeah, it bothers me. Doesn't it bother you? 

KRAMER

Not at all. 

GEORGE

See now that bothers me even more than dying bothers me, cause it's people like you who live to be a hundred and twenty because you're not bothered by it. How could it not bother you? 

KRAMER

I once saw this thing on T.V. with people who are terminally ill. And they all believed the secret of life is just to live every moment. 

GEORGE

Yeah, yeah. I've heard that. Meanwhile I'm here with you in a parking garage, what am I supposed to do? 

JERRY

First of all you don't even know technically that I went. That's for starters. I mean I could've been pouring a bottle of water out there. You don't know. 

GUARD

I know what you did. 

JERRY

Oh really, do you? Well it just so happens that I did pour water out. I had a bottle of very tepid water and I poured it out. And I could see how you made a mistake, because pouring water out sounds very much like a person urinating. 

JERRY

(CONT'D) And you know when you think about it it's really quite an amusing case of mistaken identity. That's all it is. 

GUARD

Yeah I'm sure. 

JERRY

You know this is not the first time this has happened to me. I always carry water because of my condition. It dehydrates me. It's a vicious cycle. 

ELAINE

And now he's gone. I'm sure he's looking for the car. Five minutes, that's all. I just want to find him. 

ELAINE

But why? Why can't you do it? 

ELAINE

No, see that's not a reason you can't. You just don't want to. 

ELAINE

But why? Why don't you want to? 

ELAINE

But wouldn't you get any satisfaction out of helping someone out? 

JERRY

(A NEW TACK) All right, all right. I want to apologize. I was frightened, I said crazy things. I obviously offended you. I insulted your intelligence. The uromysitisis, the water bottle...I made it all up, and now...I'm going to tell you the truth. Today my father and mother are celebrating their fiftieth, well I'm jumping ahead here, their forty-seventh wedding anniversary. We made arrangements to spend the evening together. They are supposed to be in front of my building at six-fifteen. 

JERRY

(CONT'D) What I haven't told you, or anyone else for that matter, is that my father's been in a Red Chinese prison for the past fourteen years. 

KRAMER

The guy's got a fat fetish. Spector never dates a woman under two hundred-fifty pounds. 

GEORGE

(NOT INTERESTED) Really. 

KRAMER

What does he do with all that fat? Does he just jump up and down on it? Does he gouge it like Killer Kowalski? 

GEORGE

Who's Killer Kowalski? 

KRAMER

He was a wrestler. He would grab hold of someone's stomach and just squeeze it until they gave. 

GEORGE

I've gotta go to the bathroom. 

KRAMER

So go. GEORGE Here? 

KRAMER

(SHAKING HIS HEAD) You and Jerry. 

GEORGE

Don't you believe me? It's their fiftieth anniversary. You know this is gonna kill him. You're aware of that. Kill him. On the biggest night of his life... 

GUARD

Oh your folks have an anniversary today too? 

JERRY

(TO GEORGE) Was he also in a Red Chinese prison? 

GEORGE

(TO JERRY, SOMEWHAT IMPRESSED) A Red Chinese prison? 

KRAMER

George! George! 

ELAINE

Jerry! (THEN SHE CHECKS HER FISH) 

JERRY

Well what happened was my father was staying in the home of one of Red China's great military leaders, General Chang, who by the way came up with the recipe for General Chang's chicken. You know, the one with the red peppers and orange peel at Szechwan Gardens? GEORGE Sure, I have it all the time. Very spicy. 

JERRY

Well General Chang was a very flamboyant man. A complete failure as a general, but a helluva cook. 

ELAINE

(O.C.) Jerry! JERRY Elaine?! 

ELAINE

(O.C.) Jerry! Over here... 

ELAINE

(CONT'D) Where have you been? 

JERRY

I was arrested for urinating. 

GEORGE

(PROUDLY) Me too. 

ELAINE

You what? 

JERRY

I have uromysitisis. It's very serious you know. 

ELAINE

Look at my fish... (JERRY EXAMINES IT) Is he... 

JERRY

No, but he's not looking good... (ELAINE TURNS TO TWO HUGE BODY BUILDERS IN WORKOUT WEAR) 

ELAINE

(DESPERATE) Please, we can't find our car. Please drive us around the parking lot to find our car. My fish are dying. 

ELAINE

I can see not caring what happens to us, we're human. But what about the fish? The fish? 

ELAINE

That's right, go. Go home to your dumbbells. Work on your pecs. I'm really impressed. 

ELAINE

(CONT'D) That's right you heard me. You got a problem with that? 

GEORGE

Elaine, shut-up. 

JERRY

Hey, where's Kramer? 

GEORGE

I don't know. (TO ELAINE) Where's Kramer? 

ELAINE

I thought he was with you. 

GEORGE

See, I knew it. I knew this was gonna happen... 

GEORGE

(CONT'D) Look at the time, that's it. 

ELAINE

Have we looked over there? Have we checked that side? 

GEORGE

We came in over there! 

ELAINE

We didn't come in over there! 

JERRY

Where's Kramer? 

JERRY

Hey George, there she is again. ... 

GEORGE

So what do you want me to do? 

JERRY

Ask her to drive us around. There's your opening. 

GEORGE

That is an opening. 

GEORGE

(CONT'D) Excuse me...I really... What's happened is that my friend forgot where he parked and if you're not in a big hurry, we'd really appreciate it if... 

AMY

Oh sure, I'll drive you around. 

GEORGE

You will? 

AMY

Sure. 

GEORGE

Thanks a lot. I'm really late. My parents are waiting in front of my building and we're stuck here. 

AMY

I wouldn't want to get lost in here. It smells like a toilet. People are such animals. 

GEORGE

Yeah, right. 

JERRY

Filthy pigs. 

GEORGE

It's a blue Honda... 

AMY

This has happened to me too. It's very frustrating. 

ELAINE

Hi, I'm Elaine. 

JERRY

Jerry. 

AMY

Hello. 

ELAINE

It's very nice of you to do this. I've asked several people and they wouldn't even answer me. 

AMY

I'm happy to do it. (TO GEORGE) I'm Amy. 

GEORGE

Hi Amy, I'm George. 

GEORGE

(TALKING IN PASSENGER WINDOW) I didn't mean anything by it. I don't even know L. Ron Hubbard! I didn't know you were... 

GEORGE

(CONT'D) ...with that group. 

ELAINE

(SHOUTING TO AMY) What about my fish? 

JERRY

Boy, those Scientologists. They can be pretty sensitive. 

ELAINE

I'll say. 

ELAINE

What is it? (THEY DISCOVER WHAT HE'S STARING AT) The car! 

JERRY

The car! 

GEORGE

The car! 

ELAINE

We found it. I can't believe it! 

GEORGE

Kramer, Kramer's not here...I knew it. I knew it! I knew this would happen. (SCREAMING) Kramer! Kramer! 

JERRY

Kramer! 

JERRY

Kramer. 

KRAMER

Jerry? 

JERRY

Yeah, over here. 

KRAMER

Boy I had a helluva time finding that air-conditioner. I looked everywhere. I completely forgot where I hid it. You know where it was? 

GEORGE

Purple 23. 

KRAMER

Right! Purple 23. I could've used you. 

GEORGE

Sometimes it's good to have a pencil to write these things down. 

KRAMER

What time is it? 

GEORGE

Seven forty-five. 

KRAMER

Well at least there's no traffic. 

GEORGE

Right. 

KRAMER

What time does that play start? 

GEORGE

Eight o'clock. 

KRAMER

That might be a problem. (TO ELAINE) Where's your little bag of... 

KRAMER

(CONT'D) Oh...(TAKES OUT PARKING STUB) Boy this garage is going to cost a fortune. You know how long we were here? 

GEORGE

She thinks I'm a nice guy. Women always think I'm nice, but women don't&nbsp;nice. 

JERRY

This is amazing, I haven't seen one person go in to that restaurant since it opened. Poor guy. 

GEORGE

Why is nice bad? What kind a of sick society we are living in, when nice is bad? 

JERRY

What's that smell? What are you wearing? 

GEORGE

What, a 'little' cologne. 

JERRY

Manly. 

GEORGE

Monica wants me to wear it. 

JERRY

So why didn't you say no? 

GEORGE

I'm too nice. 

JERRY

Look at this poor guy. His family is probably in Pakistan -- they're waiting him to send back money. This is horrible. 

GEORGE

She wants me to take an IQ test. 

JERRY

That's because you're stupid enough to wear the cologne. 

GEORGE

No, she's taking this course in education for her masters. It's part of her research project, so I have to be a guinea pig. 

JERRY

I've never been a guinea pig. I've been a sheep, a tody. 

GEORGE

You know, I can't talk to you anymore. 

JERRY

All right, I'm sorry. Go ahead, you're taking the IQ test. 

GEORGE

Yeah, and she's going to find I'm a moron. You know, people think I'm smart, but I'm not smart. 

JERRY

Who thinks you're smart? 

GEORGE

I'm not going to break a hundred on this thing. 

JERRY

What thing? 

GEORGE

You don't listen when people talk to you anymore! 

JERRY

Oh, Oh, the IQ thing...yeah. 

GEORGE

I'm sure I have a low IQ. I've been lying about my SAT scores for 15 years. 

JERRY

What'd ya get? 

GEORGE

What did I get or what do I say I got? 

JERRY

What do you say? 

GEORGE

I say fourteen o nine (1409). 

JERRY

1409, that's a good score. 

GEORGE

Psst, You're telling me. 

JERRY

What did you really get? 

GEORGE

You are my friend. 

JERRY

Of course. 

GEORGE

I tell you everything, right? 

JERRY

I hope so. 

GEORGE

Well, this I take to the grave. 

JERRY

He's serving Mexican, Italian, Chinese. He's all over the place. That's why no one's going in. 

ELAINE

Why do you keep watching? 

JERRY

I don't know, I'm obsessed with it. It's like a spider in the toilet struggling for&nbsp; survival. And even though ya know he's not going to make it, y-y-you kind of root for&nbsp; him for a second. 

ELAINE

And then you flush. 

JERRY

Well, it's a spider. 

ELAINE

You know, sometimes people won't go in a place, if they don't see anyone else in there. 

ELAINE

Do you have to do that? Jerry, don't do that, that is so annoying. 

JERRY

Bazooka Joe. 

JERRY

The buzzer. 

ELAINE

It's your house. 

JERRY

My house? You gotta be on the lease to press to buzzer. Yeah? (to the intercom) 

INTERCOM

It's George. 

JERRY

Come on up. 

ELAINE

Casus belli. 

JERRY

What's that? 

ELAINE

It's Latin. I read it in some book. I don't know, I just wanted to say it out loud. 

JERRY

Come on, Go in, go in!&nbsp; [watching Dream Cafe with binoculars again] 

ELAINE

Have you gone in there? 

JERRY

No, I'm afraid we'll start talking, and I'll gonna wind up going partners with him. 

GEORGE

Hey. 

JERRY

You know, I could probably shoot him from here. I'd be doing us both a favor. 

GEORGE

I'm wearing some cologne, all right? 

ELAINE

Sure, fine. 

JERRY

Casus belli. 

ELAINE

Casus belli. 

GEORGE

What's that? 

ELAINE

Since when do you wear cologne? 

GEORGE

Why is what I do is so important? Why must I be always the focal point of attention? Let me just be, let me live. 

JERRY

Hey, how'd you do on that IQ test? 

GEORGE

I didn't take it, yet. 

ELAINE

What IQ test? 

GEORGE

What's casus belli. 

JERRY

Oh, it's nothing... 

GEORGE

Is it about me? 

JERRY

Why must you always be the focal point of attention? Why can't you just be? (Elaine laughs - hu) Why can't you live? 

ELAINE

It's just a Latin phrase George, it does not mean anything. Now, what is this test? 

JERRY

This woman he's dating is making him take this IQ test for this course. 

ELAINE

Oh, that sounds like fun. 

GEORGE

Yeah, fun. IQ tests are totally bogus. They prove nothing. 

ELAINE

You'll do well, you're smart. 

JERRY

No see, he's not smart. People think he's smart, but he's not. 

ELAINE

Wha'd you get on your SAT's? 

GEORGE

It varies. 

JERRY

You know, I don't even know my IQ. 

ELAINE

huh, Mine's 145. 

GEORGE

145! 

JERRY

Get out of here! 

ELAINE

You get out of here! 

JERRY

You get out of here! 

ELAINE

Huhuhuhuhuhuhu (laughing) 

GEORGE

Shst, You should take the test for me. 

ELAINE

Huh. 

JERRY

Boy that'd be something, cheating on a IQ test. 

GEORGE

Haha (laughs) 

JERRY

Hey, remember in college when you passed Lettick the test out the window? You became a legend after that.&nbsp; (stepping over Elaine then George's legs to get to the large blue chair and sits down.) 

GEORGE

Yeah, yeah I really had some guts back then. Why don't we do it again? 

ELAINE

What? 

GEORGE

You could take the IQ test for me. I could pass it to you out a window. We could do it, she lives in the first floor. 

ELAINE

Are you serious? 

GEORGE

Why not? 

ELAINE

Where would I take the test? 

GEORGE

I don't know, she lives right around the corner. You could take it here or go to the coffee shop. 

ELAINE

No, that'd be too noisy. 

JERRY

Take it to Dream Cafe, you won't hear a peep. 

ELAINE

Hey, what do you think? 

JERRY

Hey, I love a good caper. 

ELAINE

Yeah, that's what is, isn't it? A caper. Huh. 

GEORGE

You'll do it? 

ELAINE

What the hey. 

GEORGE

Yeaah, beautiful... (They try to hit a high five, but George hits Elaine in the forehead.) Sorry... 

JERRY

Well, ah, I've been looking forward to it. 

BABU

Oh, ah how did you hear about us? 

JERRY

Eh, people, people are talking. 

BABU

Smoking or non-smoking? We are proud to offer both. 

JERRY

Ah, non-smoking would be great. 

BABU

Very good. My name is Babu Bhatt, I will be your waiter. A steaming hot folded face cloth for your pleasure. 

JERRY

Thank you. [Throws the towel around like a hot potato.] 

BABU

Our specials are tacos, moussaka and franks and beans. 

JERRY

Well, ah w-what do you recommend my good fellow? 

BABU

Oh, the turkey. 

JERRY

Well then the turkey it'll be. And may I say you have a splendid establishment here, my friend. I'm sure you flourish at this location for many, many years. 

BABU

You're very kind man. Very kind, thank you. Very kind... 

JERRY

(thinks) Very kind. I am a kind man. Who else would do something like this? Nobody. Nobody thinks about people the way I do. All right, snap out of it you stupid jerk. You're eating a turkey sandwich. What do want, a Nobel Prize? 

GEORGE

You go in the living room. I'll take the test in here. 

MONICA

But why? 

GEORGE

I won't be able to, concentrate in front of you. 

MONICA

Oh, I think you're making too much of this. IQ tests don't mean anything. 

GEORGE

Are you kidding me? [Elaine walks past the window glancing in] This is the best tool we have today of measuring a persons' intelligence. 

MONICA

Well, I certainly don't place any importance on it. 

GEORGE

Well, I think you're wrong about that.&nbsp; [Elaine walks past the window again, glancing in] And ah now if you'll excuse me, I'd really like to get started, please. 

MONICA

Good luck. 

GEORGE

Don't need it. N'huhuhu (laughs) 

ELAINE

What's been going on out there? I've been standing here 20 minutes. 

GEORGE

I'm sorry I'm sorry, here's the test. Thanks again for doing this - hhe. 

ELAINE

All right, what time do you want me back here. 

GEORGE

Ah, ah, twenty to three. 

ELAINE

Ok. 

GEORGE

Thanks again. 

ELAINE

All right. 

GEORGE

A-and don't settle for 145, you can do better, you're a genius. Heheheh (laughs) 

JERRY

Thank you Babu. You have quite a flair. You are quite the restaurateur I must say. 

BABU

It is in deed my pleasure. 

JERRY

Oh, please... 

BABU

Oh, welcome to the Dream Cafe. (runs to get a menu.) Our specials today... 

ELAINE

Oh, no no no. I'll just have a tea and toast. (sits down across the table from Jerry) 

BABU

Tea and toast. 

JERRY

Eat something! Babu... 

ELAINE

Um, ok, ah well I'll have the, th-ri-rigatoni. 

BABU

Oh, oh very good choice. Very good. 

JERRY

Oh wow, so you got the test. You're cheating. 

ELAINE

I know. 

KRAMER

Hey. 

JERRY

Hey. 

KRAMER

Oh boy. Woop... 

KRAMER

Jerry let me ask you something, hi Elaine...&nbsp; (pats her on the shoulder twice.) 

ELAINE

Hey. 

KRAMER

This guy leaves this jacket at my mother's house two years ago. Now, she hasn't spoken to him since and now he says he wants the jacket back. 

JERRY

So? 

KRAMER

Well, I'm not giving it back. 

JERRY

Why not? 

KRAMER

Well because I meet a lot of women in this jacket, you know they're attracted to it. I mean why do you think my mother went out with him? 

KRAMER

Oh, gees... 

ELAINE

Ok, 

KRAMER

You're all right 

ELAINE

Yeah, ok... (takes the test and moves to another table.) 

KRAMER

(eating some nachos) Anyway, it's been two years. I mean isn't there like statue of limitations on that? 

JERRY

Statute. 

KRAMER

What? 

JERRY

Statute of limitations. It's not a statue. 

KRAMER

No, it's statue. 

JERRY

Fine, it's a sculpture of limitations. 

KRAMER

Wait a minute, Just wait a minute...Elaine, Elaine! Now you're smart, is it statue or statute of limitations? 

ELAINE

Statute. 

KRAMER

Oh, I really think you're wrong. 

ELAINE

Look, Kramer, I have to take this test ok, I don't have a lot of time. 

KRAMER

What test? 

ELAINE

An IQ test. 

KRAMER

Hmm. Why you takin' an IQ test? 

ELAINE

It's for George. 

KRAMER

George? 

ELAINE

Yeah, can-look ... can I explain it to you later? 

KRAMER

Yeah, but why are you taking an IQ test for George? 

ELAINE

Would you please?! 

KRAMER

What, is it for a job or something? 

ELAINE

Later! 

KRAMER

You're positive it's statute? 

ELAINE

Yes, yes! (Jerry shaking his head, like he can't believe what he's seeing) 

BABU

Welcome, welcome. A steaming hot face towel for your... (gives Kramer a hot towel and Kramer screams, Elaine screams and Kramer falls from his chair.&nbsp; He gets up and is dazed) 

MONICA

George? 

GEORGE

Yeah? 

MONICA

The door is locked. 

GEORGE

Oh, it's locked? 

MONICA

I need to get something. 

GEORGE

Monica, I'm really focused here, this stuff's a killer. (turns to the next page) 

MONICA

George! 

GEORGE

Wish I could. (raises the magazine up in front of his face and continues reading.) 

BABU

Nananeena, Ladadeeda, laadadeeda, saadina.... Laadadeeda sa saadina (singing too loud) 

ELAINE

Babu! Ba-If-if ya don't mind? 

BABU

Set. ok 

ELAINE

Set. 

BABU

I'll get it ... 

ELAINE

Oh my God! It's all over the test! 

BABU

Oh, I did sc-I'm terribly sorry. 

JERRY

Oh my God. 

ELAINE

Oh man! Look at this... I'm out of time anyway. 

BABU

Please, forgive me, please... 

JERRY

Go ahead, I'll take care of it. 

ELAINE

Uhh. 

BABU

(opens the door for Elaine) Please, I'm very sorry. Tell your friends! 

JERRY

It's all right, she was cheating anyway. 

BABU

You're a very kind man. 

JERRY

Babu, you're Pakistani, right? 

BABU

Yes, Pakistani, yes. 

JERRY

Babu, may I say something? 

BABU

Of course, you're very smart man, I listen. 

JERRY

I am not a restaurateur by any means, but it occurred to me that perhaps you might serve some dishes from your native Pakistan? As opposed to say t-the franks and beans for example. 

BABU

But there are no Pakistani people here. 

JERRY

Doesn't matter. You would have the only authentic Pakistani restaurant in the whole neighborhood. 

BABU

Yes, you see everything, don't you? 

JERRY

Well, you know; not everything. I do what I can. 

BABU

I close down today and when I open again it'll be all Pakistani restaurant. Thank you, thank you so much, you're very special person, very special. 

ELAINE

It was an accident. 

GEORGE

What did you go on a picnic? 

ELAINE

Babu Bhatt did it. 

GEORGE

Babu Bhatt? How I'm going to explain this? 

MONICA

Time's up George. 

GEORGE

U-ok. (George closes the window and shoos Elaine off. He opens the door to Monica.) Here you go. 

MONICA

How did you do? 

GEORGE

Piece of cake; hu. 

MONICA

What happened to the test? 

GEORGE

What? Oh I spilled some food on it. 

MONICA

Food? What food? 

GEORGE

What are you talking about? 

MONICA

Where did you get food? 

GEORGE

From my pocket. 

MONICA

Your pocket? 

GEORGE

I eh, I had a sandwich in my pocket. 

MONICA

And coffee? 

GEORGE

Yeah, had some coffee, yeah. 

MONICA

Where did you get the coffee? 

GEORGE

Where did I get the coffee? Where do think I got the coffee, at the grocery store. (small laugh) 

MONICA

How did you get there? 

GEORGE

I walked. 

MONICA

How did you get out of the apartment? I didn't see you leave. 

GEORGE

I climbed out the window. 

MONICA

You climbed out the window? 

GEORGE

Of course. 

MONICA

Why didn't you go out the door? 

GEORGE

The door? Why would I go out the door? The window's right here. 

MONICA

You're a fascinating man, George Costanza. 

JERRY

The average person in a situation like this, they walk right by it. Not me. 

ELAINE

You're very special. 

KRAMER

Hey, do me a favor... Some guy comes in looking for me, tell him you don't know where I am. 

JERRY

Of course, I always do. 

KRAMER

No, no it's that guy. He's really been bugging me about the jacket. 

ELAINE

Just give it back to him. 

KRAMER

Oh, he'll have to kill me. (leaves.) 

JERRY

Hey Georgie! 

GEORGE

Coming up. 

JERRY

How'd you do on the IQ test?! 

GEORGE

85! 

JERRY

What?!! 

GEORGE

85, Jerry! 85 IQ ! 

ELAINE

85? 

JERRY

Well, well, well... 

ELAINE

He's coming up? 

JERRY

Well, I'm no genius but, according to my calculations he should be here in a few seconds. 

ELAINE

Yeah, but an 85, Jerry, that's ridiculous. 

JERRY

Well, maybe the test was gender bias, you know a lot of questions on hunting and testicles... 

GEORGE

Oh, hello Professor. 

ELAINE

George, I cannot believe... 

GEORGE

Please... 

ELAINE

No there has got be a mistake. 

GEORGE

You should've seen her face. It was the exact same look my father gave me when I told him I wanted to be a ventriloquist. 

JERRY

But an 85? 

ELAINE

Listen, there were too many distractions there. Babu...what ever he's name was and Kramer...I couldn't concentrate. 

ELAINE

Jerry! It was! Let me take it again. 

GEORGE

Ooh ho hoo, forget it. 

ELAINE

Oh, come on, come on. I?ll guarantee 140. What do you have to lose? 

GEORGE

You could do worse! 

ELAINE

No, no, come on. I guarantee it. 

GEORGE

All right, I'll ask her. 

ELAINE

Ok, now where I'm going to take it. 

JERRY

Take it here, I'll leave, there'll be no distractions. 

JERRY

Well, congratulations my friend. You know, I'm sorry I missed the grand re-opening. I was out of town for about a week. 

BABU

You see how I listen. I work very hard, borrow more money. 

JERRY

I think it's fantastic. Has a certain indefinable charm. 

BABU

You wish to eat? 

JERRY

Let me tell you something Babu. You go back in that kitchen -- tell your chef I want the works. 

BABU

Very good. 

ELAINE

(stretching) Oh Man... Uunh. 

ELAINE

What are you doing? 

KRAMER

Quiet. Shh, don't say anything. 

ELAINE

What's going on? 

DOOR

Hey, Kramer! I saw you go there! I'm not leaving until you gimme that jacket. (Bangs on the door) Open up Kramer! 

ELAINE

Wha'd you come in here for? 

KRAMER

Ah, well I thought I'd throw him off. See, he knows where I live. 

ELAINE

Well Kramer, I have to return this test. I've got to get out of here. 

KRAMER

I thought you took the test. 

ELAINE

I had to take it again. 

KRAMER

How come? 

ELAINE

What's the difference?!! 

KRAMER

Well, you can't leave now. 

ELAINE

What? 

DOOR

Come on, Kramer! I want that jacket back! 

KRAMER

Never! 

MONICA

Come on George, open up. 

MONICA

Well? 

GEORGE

How' you doing? 

MONICA

Where's the test? 

GEORGE

Hunh, You know, it's the damnedest thing. I went out the window again to, to get a cup of coffee... 

JERRY

Babu? Babu...[waves Babu to come to table] Babu...you know, I got to tell you, I never do this, but the shrimp, it's just, it's a little stringy. You have any chicken? 

BABU

The shrimp is stringy? 

JERRY

Well, maybe your refrigerator... 

BABU

Quiet!! 

JERRY

No I... 

BABU

You shut up! 

JERRY

Well I... 

BABU

You make me change restaurant, but nobody come! You say make Pakistani, Babu Bhatt have only Pakistani restaurant. But where are people? You see people? Show me people. There are no people! 

JERRY

You know, I think I'll just take the check. 

BABU

You bad man! You very very bad man! [leaves] 

JERRY

(thinking) Bad man? Could've my mother been wrong? 

MONICA

Are you looking for George? 

ELAINE

Well eh, kind of.... 

MONICA

George left. 

ELAINE

Oh. 

MONICA

Is, that the test? 

ELAINE

Oh, this...emm...yeah...here you go. 

MONICA

Thanks. I hope you do a lot better this time. 

ELAINE

Actually, you know I think I did. The first time I couldn't really cons...[Monica closes the window]...entrate. 

JERRY

You know what it was, bad location. 

GEORGE

Come on, lets not stand here too long, we might run in to her. 

JERRY

Aren't you cold? Where's your jacket? 

KRAMER

h-Yeah... 

JERRY

Oh, sorry. 

KRAMER

I'm going upstairs. 

ELAINE

Hey guys... 

JERRY

Hey. 

ELAINE

I just ran in to Monica. You know what my IQ is? 151. 

JERRY

151? 

ELAINE

Yeah..heheah (laughing a bit) 

GEORGE

That's a good score. 

JERRY

So, what are you up for? How about Mexican? 

GEORGE

Italian. 

ELAINE

No, Chinese. 

JERRY

You know, what would be great? 

REPAIRMAN

.....The gaskets that you have here are asymmetrical. 

JERRY

Ah..ha!.. really. ( Jerry is barely listening to him ) 

REPAIRMAN

So I took off the motor relay on the compressor....'cos you..you (stutters) you've got some discoloration 

JERRY

Oh! well whatever you have to do. 

REPAIRMAN

I was working with one.....mount at a time 'cos you don't wanna disturb the position of the compressor. 

JERRY

(sarcastically) No you don't.. 

GEORGE

Hey! what are listening to? 

JERRY

My show from last night. 

GEORGE

Oh! you taped it? 

JERRY

Yeah , I was doing new material. 

GEORGE

Hey! Did 'ya ever do that thing on the toes that I said . 

JERRY

Huh? 

GEORGE

Yeah! like the big toe is like the captain of the toes, but sometimes the toe next to the big toe gets so big that there's like a power struggle and the second toe assumes control of the foot. 

JERRY

The' coup d&eacute;-toe' 

GEORGE

Yeah. Did you do it? 

JERRY

Yeah! 

GEORGE

So? 

JERRY

Nothin'.....nothing at all. 

GEORGE

Need to use the phone. 

JERRY

Who you calling? 

GEORGE

China. 

JERRY

China really? 

GEORGE

Yeah. I'll pay for it. 

JERRY

What for? 

GEORGE

What for? . I'll tell you what for.... for hair. 

JERRY

Hair? 

GEORGE

The Chinese have done it my friend. The Chinese have done it. 

JERRY

Done what? 

GEORGE

Discovered a cure for baldness. 

REPAIRMAN

Did you see that last night? 

GEORGE

It was on CNN ( Kramer comes in and he is taping from a Camcorder) This Chinese doctor Zeng Zau. has discovered a cure for baldness. 

JERRY

(to Kramer) What's this? 

KRAMER

Well I just got it. Spector gave it to me , he's giving everything away...becoming a minimalist. 

GEORGE

Is that the guy who likes fat women? 

JERRY

Doesn't the fat fetish conflict with the minimalism. 

KRAMER

(to George) You , you know what you should've done is watching that report on CNN last night. 

GEORGE

I did, I'm trying to call China. 

KRAMER

You can't call China now its like, what, three 'O clock in the morning there 

JERRY

Oh! my God!.... 

GEORGE

What? 

JERRY

Oh! God.. Oh! man.....Oh! brother!!! I can't believe what I'm hearing. This woman his talking to me on my tape recorder while I was on stage. This is wild. I've never heard anything like this in my life. Listen to this. 

GEORGE

(George puts on the headphones) Oh! my god... 

KRAMER

Give me it..( tries to pull them off George's head) 

GEORGE

Wa..Wait.Wait!......Who is this woman? 

JERRY

I don't know . I have no idea . I was just listening and she came on. 

GEORGE

This is like a Penthouse letter...Why can't I meet women like this? 

KRAMER

All right Come on....again attempts to pull headphones off) 

GEORGE

WAIT ,WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!!!!.... Where was the tape recorder? 

JERRY

It was in the back of the room on the left, she must have been sitting right in front of it. 

GEORGE

My god!!! 

KRAMER

C'mon it's my turn. 

GEORGE

All right, All right, all, right!!( gives the headphones to Kramer) How you gonna find out who this is? 

JERRY

Good question. 

KRAMER

Where's the volume..(finds it) A, YAI..YA...YA..YA!!!! 

GEORGE

What do the Chinese have to gain by faking a cure for baldness? 

JERRY

If it was real ,they would never let it out of the country. No baldness , it'd be like a nation of Supermen. 

ELAINE

Hi boys. 

BOTH

ELAINE

JERRY

JERRY

No I meant the bald cure. We were talking about the bald cure. 

ELAINE

PETER

JERRY

Hey! Is that Peter? ...I can't believe it. Get me a cup of Decaf. (leaves table) 

ELAINE

So did you hear this message? 

GEORGE

ELAINE

GEORGE

This woman drove us out of our minds 

ELAINE

GEORGE

She had this throaty , sexy kind of whisper. 

ELAINE

GEORGE

Oh! my God!!......You?.....You?...That was you?....

GEORGE

Oh! no no nothing.... 

ELAINE

Now listen , promise me you won't tell him Okay.I want to have a little fun with this. 

GEORGE

ELAINE

GEORGE

Ah! Some bald thing, a bald thing I dunno. It's nothing 

JERRY

Remember Peter? 

GEORGE

Peter? 

JERRY

You remember Peter. remember I told you how he went to the track that one time and he was yelling at this jockey and the jockey got off the horse and started chasin' him. 

ELAINE

So listen , what about this girl on the tape recorder? 

JERRY

Oh Elaine....What do you think an enraptured female fan of mine might say? 

ELAINE

I don't know. 

JERRY

She went on in some detail about certain activities, illegal in some states, for consenting adults. Things you would know very little about. 

ELAINE

Oh! really. 

JERRY

Well this type of things is very common when you're in show business. 

ELAINE

So what, Are you gonna ask her out. 

JERRY

No I can't she didn't leave her name or number. 

ELAINE

Bummer...Okay , good luck finding her . I'm taking off.

ELAINE

JERRY

Sure. 

GEORGE

Oh! my god. Oh! man... 

JERRY

I don't get it. Why would a woman do that and then leave no way to get in touch with her. 

ELAINE

(coming out of the shower in a bathrobe) May be she realized she could never have you and she jumped off the George Washington Bridge. 

GEORGE

(phone rings ,picks up) Operator? Beijing? 

JERRY

Why are you doing this? 

GEORGE

Why do I do anything? tsss...For women. 

JERRY

GEORGE

KRAMER

GEORGE

(visibly disturbed) I...I..I dunno. 

KRAMER

So Elaine in your movies is the sex real or is it simulated? 

ELAINE

Oh. it's always simulated....except with George that's in my contract. 

GEORGE

All right, Kramer that's it.....( pushes the camera) Hello . English. Does anyone speak English 

KRAMER

PING

ELAINE

GEORGE

ELAINE

( feeling awkward as well) Yeah! that was a...f...fun ..mmm?. 

GEORGE

So all right I'll speak to you through Jerry and everything. 

ELAINE

Okay...Thanks a lot for the ride. 

JERRY

..She was sitting at the table where I had my tape recorder...Okay great. Thanks again.. bye. HA Ha..Who do these women think they're dealing with? Did she think she was gonna leave this incredibly erotic message on my tape and I was just gonna let it go. Not Bloody likely... 

KRAMER

What is that? 

JERRY

That's my cockney accent. 

KRAMER

Naw ,na , that's no good. 

JERRY

Lets hear yours. 

KRAMER

Not bloody likely.. 

JERRY

That's the worst cockney accent I've ever heard in my life.( George enters) Hey! Georgie boy , guess what I got. 

GEORGE

Guess, what I got. 

JERRY

Oh! Is that the bald stuff? 

GEORGE

From China. All the way from China. 

KRAMER

Wait,wait wait...Let me get the camera. 

GEORGE

No Don't get the camera , we don't need the camera. Listen I know your skeptical , but I really believe in the Chinese. 

JERRY

Yes I am skeptical. 

GEORGE

Why do you have to be so suspicious of every one. This is a great man Zeng Zau, he wants to help bald people. 

KRAMER

W..W..Wa...Wa..Wait..Wait wait.. Now lets videotape your head for the before picture, so we can watch how it grows and stuff. Sit down (George sits).....Lean back...A little bit to the right. 

JERRY

Make sure you get this area here, where he needs the help.... 

GEORGE

All right, all right ( Goes to the bathroom) 

KRAMER

He's a happy camper huh? 

JERRY

Happy camper , I don't hear that expression enough. 

KRAMER

Remember that guy who took my jacket. The one I found at my mother's house. 

JERRY

Yeah. 

KRAMER

My mother told me that he got arrested for mail fraud 

JERRY

No kidding? 

KRAMER

He's in jail. 

JERRY

What happened to the jacket. Did he take it with him? 

KRAMER

That's what I intend to find out. (George comes out of the bathroom and he's got white cream on his head) 

JERRY

You can see it. You gonna walk around like that? 

KRAMER

It stinks. Can you smell that?....You stink. 

JERRY

How long are you suppose to leave it on for? 

GEORGE

All day. ( phone rings , Jerry picks up) 

JERRY

Hello. 

ELAINE

It's Elaine Marie Benes. 

JERRY

Well Hello.. 

ELAINE

Hello.. so did you ever find out who that woman was? 

JERRY

Yes , I got her number. 

GEORGE

Is that Elaine? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

GEORGE

HI ELAINE... 

ELAINE

I guess you figure you're in for a pretty wild night? 

JERRY

Well , as I said this type of thing is very common in show business 

ELAINE

Well listen I'm going to (?) do you want me to stop by? 

GEORGE

Did she say Hello? 

JERRY

What? I dunno. 

GEORGE

I mean , when I said Hello did she say Hello back? 

JERRY

I don't know , Who keeps track of Hellos. 

GEORGE

Isn't polite to say Hello when somebody says hello? 

JERRY

She's coming up. 

GEORGE

Elaine's coming up? 

JERRY

Yeah. What's wrong, why? ( George runs back to the bathroom) 

KRAMER

How often do you cut your toe nails? 

JERRY

I would say every two and a half to eight weeks. 

KRAMER

'cos the other night , you know, I was sleeping with Marion I rolled over and I cut her ankle with my big toe. 

JERRY

The big toe; The captain. 

KRAMER

What? 

JERRY

The captain of the toes. (phone rings) Hello. 

ELAINE

Jerry...Jerry listen I got too much stuff this afternoon, I can't come over, forget it. 

JERRY

Okay....too bad. 

ELAINE

So humm....When you gonna call her? 

JERRY

Soon as I get off the phone wih you. 

ELAINE

Good luck. 

JERRY

okay , bye (to George) What happened , did you take it off? 

GEORGE

Yeah, that was enough. 

JERRY

That's it, you gave up? 

GEORGE

No No I'm working on a system...Who was that? 

JERRY

That was Elaine , she changed her mind. She's not coming over. 

ALICIA

JERRY

Hello is this Alicia? .This is Jerry Seinfeld. 

ALICIA

Yeah. 

JERRY

This is Jerry Seinfeld. 

JERRY

JERRY

Yeah.. 

GEORGE

It's George. 

JERRY

Come on up . (looks at his watch) ...What's he doing here now? 

KRAMER

So , you blew it? 

JERRY

She must be psychotic or something. 

KRAMER

Let me have her number. 

JERRY

I'm not giving you her number. 

KRAMER

I know how to handle these psychotics. 

JERRY

Sheriff?........What's with the hat? 

KRAMER

(George takes off the hat , he's got that cream on again) Pheeewwww! Boy! You stink. 

JERRY

What are doing here now? 

GEORGE

I have to talk to you about something . 

KRAMER

All right lets take a look to see what we got ( examines George's head) Wait a second.. I think I see something here George. Lets go to the videotape. 

GEORGE

Aahh..No..No.. 

JERRY

What's up? 

GEORGE

I can't tell ya now , he's gonna be back in a ten seconds. 

JERRY

So just start it. 

GEORGE

I can't. 

JERRY

Oh! Come om . He'll be over there for a half hour, he gets lost over there. C'mon so what is this about? 

GEORGE

All right.........I've become attracted to Elaine.. 

KRAMER

All right....Sit down George. 

GEORGE

Kramer, can we do this later.. 

KRAMER

No, I got the tape right here. 

JERRY

Kramer, let's do this later. 

KRAMER

(ignoring them) Now.. This is the tape that we made earlier and I think, that I see. a couple of buds right here. 

GEORGE

Really? ..You think. 

JERRY

Kramer. I would like to talk to George for a minute, please. 

KRAMER

'bout what? 

JERRY

It's kinda private. 

KRAMER

Like the big toe captain.. 

GEORGE

So now you're doing my bits? 

JERRY

I'M NOT DOING YOUR BITS!! 

KRAMER

Okay , all right. I'm gonna take a look at this huh!.( leaves) 

JERRY

Does she know? 

GEORGE

NO!! 

JERRY

How did it happen? 

GEORGE

I can't say. 

JERRY

Well, why can't you say it? 

GEORGE

Because I promised her. 

JERRY

I thought you just said she doesn't know?? 

GEORGE

She doesn't. 

JERRY

So how can you promise her? 

GEORGE

Because she asked me to. 

JERRY

What is this, an Abbott and Costello routine? 

GEORGE

All right You really want to know?...It all started when she told met hat...she was the voice on your tape recorder. 

JERRY

What, Elaine? 

GEORGE

Yeah! She made me promise not to tell you .It's supposed to be a joke. 

JERRY

(picks up the headphones) That was Elaine... 

GEORGE

Well let me hear....( they struggle for the headphones) 

JERRY

Wait a second. .Just give me a second 

GEORGE

You heard it fifty times already. 

JERRY

She's my ex-girlfriend I think I have precedence 

JERRY

Yeaaaah!!! 

ELAINE

Hi, It's Elaine is this a bad time? 

GEORGE

(Yelling from the bathroom) Don't tell her anything, she'll kill me!! 

JERRY

Okay, Okay, I promise. (puts on the headphones again) Wow!!! Oh Man...Oh God.. Oh Brother....Whoooaaaa!! Whoaaaa (Elaine enters he takes them off rapidly) 

ELAINE

(Concerned) What's the matter? 

JERRY

Oooh! I got a pain in my side. 

ELAINE

(to George returning) Hi George. Something stinks in here.( George motions to Jerry, she nods) 

JERRY

What are you doing here? 

ELAINE

I was the one who talked into your tape recorder. 

JERRY

I know, George told me. 

ELAINE

You told him!!!! 

GEORGE

He..He threatened me. 

JERRY

Where did you come up with all that stuff? 

ELAINE

That was nothing. 

GEORGE

Elaine.. I have to tell you something... 

JERRY

George NO!! 

GEORGE

No no no no no no no.. 

JERRY

George I'm telling ya.. 

ELAINE

What is it? 

GEORGE

I'm very attracted to you.. 

JERRY

Aye...... 

KRAMER

I'VE FOUND A HAIR!!! Yes ( goes up to the video machine and inserts the tape) Hey, come here, come here ,take a look at this. 

GEORGE

Ever since I found out that you let that message on Jerry's tape recorder I... 

KRAMER

Whoa!!!....That was you? 

ELAINE

It was a joke... 

KRAMER

Wait..( picks up the walkman) Oh my god...Oh yeah....Elaine , I can't believe that that is you. 

ELAINE

Aah.... ( she stares at the three of them all lined up like the Daltons, all looking at her with lust.) I think I'll get going... 

GEORGE

Heuh. huh. Stick around a while. 

JERRY

It's early. 

KRAMER

We'll order Chinese. 

GEORGE

Where'd you meet her? 

JERRY

I met her on an elevator. 

GEORGE

On an elevator? You met a woman on an elevator? 

JERRY

Impossible, right? 

GEORGE

You got less than sixty seconds. That's like dismantling a time bomb. What got into you? 

JERRY

I don't know. She was so beautiful, it was like a pure reflex. The words just came out of my mouth. 

GEORGE

Wow. What'd you say? 

JERRY

You know, I'm the one responsible for those crop circles in England. 

GEORGE

Wow. 

JERRY

Can you believe I did that? 

GEORGE

What did she say? 

ISABEL

What crop circles? 

JERRY

Not a good sign. 

GEORGE

Not everybody knows what the crop circles are. (to the newsstand owner) Do you know what the crop circles are? 

OWNER

Crop circles? Why don't you buy something? 

JERRY

You got something in your teeth there. 

GEORGE

What? 

JERRY

It's green. 

GEORGE

Oh, man, it's spinach! I've been walking around like this all afternoon. 

JERRY

Did you bump into anybody you knew? 

GEORGE

I had a job interview. 

JERRY

How'd it go? 

GEORGE

Take a guess. 

INTERVIEWER

Well, Mr. Costanza, we have nothing available at the present time, but should anything open up, we'll be in touch. 

GEORGE

Ok, thanks. 

JERRY

What do you need a job, you got Audrey. 

GEORGE

Yeah, right. 

JERRY

What's the matter? 

GEORGE

Oh, nothing. 

JERRY

What? 

GEORGE

You won't think I'm a bad person? 

JERRY

Too late for that. 

GEORGE

'Cause believe me, I would only say this to you and maybe a psychiatrist, maybe. Well, her nose is a little big. 

JERRY

Yeah, she's got a big nose. 

GEORGE

I mean, big would even be ok, a little beyond big. 

JERRY

It's a schnoz. 

GEORGE

Now, I'm aware that my own physical dimensions are perhaps a little short of perfection. 

JERRY

A little. 

GEORGE

So who am I to be thinking about someone's nose? I mean, I should be grateful someone like her even looks at me. I have no job, nothing. But I have to say, I think about the nose. I don't want to think about the nose. I don't ask to think about the nose, but I think about it. I go to bed at night, I tell myself, 'Don't think about the nose, forget the nose,' but I think about it. I look at her, I see nose. 

JERRY

Stop being so concerned with looks. 

JERRY

Have you said anything to her about it? 

GEORGE

I could never do that. You know the ironic thing is if she had a smaller nose, I never could have gone out with her in the first place. She'd be out of my league with a smaller nose. And I really like her, I know that. And I know one other thing. I'm not getting past that nose. 

JERRY

Alright, shut up, here they come. 

GEORGE

(waving) How can I not think about it? Look at the size of this thing. 

KRAMER

So my mother's going out with this guy who leaves a jacket in her house so, you know, she gives it to me. Well, two years later he shows up and he takes it back. And now he's in prison. He got arrested for mail fraud. So Elaine, all you have to do is go over to the apartment, tell the landlord that you're his daughter and you want to bring him the jacket in prison. 

ELAINE

Won't the landlord know I'm not the daughter? 

KRAMER

No no, he's never met her. She's in California. 

ELAINE

Are you coming with me? 

KRAMER

Oh, yeah yeah, I have to. I'm your fianc&eacute;, Peter Von Nostrand. 

GEORGE

Why don't you just commit yourself already? 

AUDREY

What is so special about this jacket? 

ELAINE

He believes it possesses some extraordinary power over women. 

AUDREY

What's the smudge on your hand? 

KRAMER

Oh, I got stamped at the reggae lounge last night. Yeah, I'm going back there tonight, you know, I'm not gonna pay another cover charge. 

GEORGE

What, you didn't wash all day? 

KRAMER

Yeah, I washed, just not the hand. You wouldn't believe the women at this club. Ohh, man. 

AUDREY

It's amazing how many beautiful women live in New York. I actually find it kind of intimidating. 

KRAMER

Well, you're as pretty as any of them, you just need a nose job. 

ELAINE

Kramer! 

KRAMER

What? What? 

ELAINE

How could you say something like that?! 

KRAMER

What? What do you mean? I just said she needs a nose job. 

ELAINE

No no, there's nothing wrong with her nose! I'm so sorry, Audrey. 

AUDREY

No, it's ok. 

ELAINE

What did you have to say that for? 

KRAMER

Well, I was just trying to help out. 

ELAINE

Yeah? Well, you can kiss that jacket goodbye, Mr. Von Nozzin. 

KRAMER

You see what happens when you try to be nice? 

AUDREY

Elaine said I could stay with her another month until Tina gets back. What are you thinking about? 

GEORGE

Thinking? Nothing. What could I possibly be thinking? 

AUDREY

You look like you've got something on your mind. 

GEORGE

Oh, yeah, right. I wish I had something on my mind. (pregnant pause) So how about that Kramer, huh? 

AUDREY

How about him? 

GEORGE

They way he just says stuff. 

AUDREY

He sure does. 

GEORGE

Yeah. Yeah, he's quite a character. 

AUDREY

So, what did you think? 

GEORGE

About the pizza? 

AUDREY

No, about the nose job. 

GEORGE

Oh, the nose job. I don't know, what did you think? 

AUDREY

Well, I've thought about it, but I don't know. 

GEORGE

Yeah. (another pause) Not that I care, one way or the other, but these doctors today really do amazing things, you know, if you were so inclined. And again, I'm not suggesting. 

AUDREY

I know, they're good. 

GEORGE

Peter Jennings had one. 

AUDREY

Really? 

GEORGE

Probably. They all do. In my high school, half my graduating class had them. Of course, I'm from Long Island, so... 

AUDREY

Uh huh. 

GEORGE

It's really nothing, it's like going to the dentist. 

AUDREY

I hate the dentist. 

GEORGE

It's a cleaning. 

AUDREY

So you really think I should do this? 

GEORGE

If it makes you happy, I don't focus on these things. I will tell you this: Unfortunately, we live in a very superficial society. I don't condone it, but it's a fact of life. 

AUDREY

Well, maybe I should. 

GEORGE

What the hell. 

ELAINE

(barging in) Aw, now you talked her into getting a nose job? 

GEORGE

Me? I didn't say anything. 

ELAINE

You encouraged her to get one. 

GEORGE

I didn't encourage. No encourage. 

ELAINE

Peter Jennings had one? 

GEORGE

It's possible. 

ELAINE

Well, I think you should accept her for who she is. 

AUDREY

No, George is right. I want to get one. 

ELAINE

I think it's a mistake. 

GEORGE

Me too, really. Unless you'd really like to get one. 

GEORGE

I'm going straight to hell, no two ways about it. 

JERRY

Well, it might not be hell but you're gonna run into some bad dudes. 

GEORGE

(checking his watch) Hey, let's get the check, she's taking the bandages off at four o'clock. 

JERRY

We have time. 

GEORGE

It's exciting, isn't it? She's gonna have a whole new face. 

JERRY

It is exciting. 

GEORGE

Of course, not as exciting as miss crop circles, but... 

JERRY

Please, please, Isabel? She is the most despicable woman I have ever met in my life. I have never been so repulsed by someone mentally and so attracted to them physically at the same time. It's like my brain is facing my penis in a chess game. And I'm letting him win. 

GEORGE

You're not letting him win. He wins till you're forty. 

JERRY

Then what? 

GEORGE

He still wins but it's not a blowout. 

JERRY

She wants to be an actress. She makes me read these moronic acting scenes with her, and I do it because I'm so addicted to the sex, I'm helpless, I'll do anything. So finally Kramer comes in the other day. 

JERRY

(holding up a piece of paper) I don't want to see this woman anymore but I haven't got the will power to throw out her number. Please, help me. Help me. 

KRAMER

(taking the paper and tearing it to pieces) I'm proud of you. 

JERRY

So I'm never gonna see her again, I'm going cold turkey. 

GEORGE

Good for you. 

JERRY

I'll tell you, the sex... I mean, I was like an animal. I mean it was just completely uninhibited. 

GEORGE

It's like going to the bathroom in front of a lot of people and not caring. 

JERRY

It's not like that at all. 

ELAINE

How do you even know the jacket is there? 

KRAMER

Well I don't, I'm guessing. 

GEORGE

Okay, look, Audrey, before you take the bandage off just remember that I was the one that encouraged you to do this, you know? Now that you're gonna be a great beauty, let's not forget how this all began. You know, like if you'd listened to your friend, Elaine, 

AUDREY

George? 

GEORGE

Yeah? 

AUDREY

Enough. 

JERRY

Alright, are we ready? Come on, let's get this show on the road. 

ELAINE

Are you sure you want us here for this? 

AUDREY

Yes. 

JERRY

Shouldn't a doctor do it? 

AUDREY

No, he said I could do it. Okay, here goes. 

GEORGE

Very exciting, very exciting, it's like watching a birth. 

ELAINE

It looks good. 

JERRY

Great job. 

KRAMER

You got butchered. 

JERRY

Let's put him over here. 

KRAMER

(to a fleeing Audrey) Where are you going? 

AUDREY

(with hand covering nose) To the doctor! 

KRAMER

Wait, wait, wait, I'll go with you. 

ELAINE

How ya feeling? 

GEORGE

Too much salt in my diet. 

ELAINE

Can I get you anything? 

GEORGE

Nah, I'm good. 

ELAINE

You sure? Anything? 

GEORGE

Mmm, no. Boy, it really didn't come out too well, did it? 

ELAINE

No, it didn't. No, it didn't. 

GEORGE

It's like, all dented. 

ELAINE

Seems to be. 

GEORGE

Well, I'm sure they'll be able to fix it. You can't stop modern science. Can't stop it, you can't stop it. Can't stop science. Can't be stopped, no way, no how, science just marches-- 

ELAINE

Shut up, George. 

GEORGE

Shut up? 

ELAINE

Yeah. 

GEORGE

Interesting. 

JERRY

Come on, Kramer, seriously, give me her number! 

KRAMER

I don't have it, I threw it out. 

JERRY

You're lying! You got it, I want that number! 

KRAMER

I told you, I threw it out. 

JERRY

Give it to me! 

KRAMER

You told me not to give it to you, you made me promise. 

JERRY

Well, I changed my mind, I want that number. 

KRAMER

You said, no matter what you do or say, I'm not to give you the number. 

JERRY

I was lying, give it to me! 

KRAMER

No, you told me not to! 

JERRY

I want that number! 

KRAMER

Alright! (flinging pieces of torn paper to the ground) Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! (Jerry falls to the floor and starts arranging pieces) Look at you! Look at what you've sunk to! Look at what you've become! Look in the mirror, cause you need help, Jerry. You need help, because I can't stand by and do it anymore. It's turning my stomach! I can't stand around here watching you destroy yourself. It's eating me up inside! 

AUDREY

The doctor said that they need to build the lateral wall of the septum. Over here... 

GEORGE

Yeah. 

AUDREY

You see this perinasal sinus cavity? 

GEORGE

Oh, I got it. 

AUDREY

You see how it's collapsing? That's what's causing this huge dent. 

GEORGE

Yeah, phew. 

AUDREY

So anyway, George, do you know what I was thinking about? 

GEORGE

What? 

AUDREY

Remember we talked about taking a trip together? 

GEORGE

We did? 

AUDREY

Yeah, we talked about going to Hawaii? 

GEORGE

Hawaii? 

AUDREY

Anyway, I think it would be great to get away after all this. 

GEORGE

(removing his glasses) You know, Hawaii could be a little tricky right now, there's a lot of high pressure winds down there this time of year, there's a lot of debris constantly flying around. Wood, and uh, lava, pretty dangerous. 

AUDREY

I never heard that. 

GEORGE

Oh yeah. My friend lived there. 

AUDREY

We could go to the Caribbean. 

GEORGE

You know, I have to tell you something. You couldn't get me on a plane right now. I get those FAA reports directly. My uncle sends them to me, he used to be a pilot, so. Big investigation in the, uh, what's the word there, uh, offing. It's in the offing. But, you know, you shouldn't let that stop you from going. You could go. I don't mind. 

AUDREY

George, I don't think this is working. 

ISABEL

Ever since you came back from the Army, you've changed. I swear Nelson, I don't even know who you are anymore. 

JERRY

I'm Nelson! 

ISABEL

That's not the line, Jerry. 

JERRY

Alright, alright, I'm sorry. (reading) Nothing's changed, Alma, I just need more time. 

ISABEL

I swear, Nelson, sometimes at night, when you're not around, I just go crazy thinking about you. 

JERRY

Well, you just need to relax. Maybe a hobby, bowling is fun. 

ISABEL

Yeah, bowling's good if you're really gross and ugly. 

JERRY

(to himself: Uh oh. My organs are playing chess again. 

BRAIN

Well I'm getting a little tired of this. What do you say we play one for all the marbles? 

PENIS

Oh Brain, what are you doing? You cannot beat me. Do you have any idea who you're dealing with? Forget about it! 

BRAIN

I can't take her anymore. I hate reading her stupid little acting scenes. 

PENIS

Oh, so what? So you read from a little play. You can't put up with that for an hour to make me happy? You're so selfish. Give me one hour, then I will take over, you will not have to think for the rest of the night. 

BRAIN

What about tomorrow morning? Do you have any idea what that's like for me? Do you care? No, you don't care. So long as you get to do whatever it is you do. You disgust me. 

PENIS

Oh, go read a book. 

BRAIN

Enough chatting, let's play. 

ELAINE

You know the only reason I'm doing this is because you took Audrey to the hospital. 

KRAMER

(filling a pipe) Yeah, yeah, ok, now uh, you're clear, you got everything? 

ELAINE

Yeah. 

KRAMER

Wait wait wait wait wait. (putting a ring on Elaine's finger) Here. 

ELAINE

What do I need this for? 

KRAMER

Because we're engaged. 

ELAINE

We're engaged? 

KRAMER

Um hm. 

ELAINE

Kramer, this is too big. 

KRAMER

(lighting his pipe) It's my mom's. 

LANDLORD

Hello? 

ELAINE

Oh, uh, hi. I'm Wanda Pepper, I'm Albert Pepper's daughter. My father asked me to come here and pick up his jacket for him. 

LANDLORD

Oh, hello Miss Pepper, it's a pleasure to meet you. (To Kramer) And you must be Professor Von Nostrand? 

KRAMER

Yes, yes I am. 

LANDLORD

I've read your book, Professor, and I was quite intrigued by it. 

KRAMER

Uh, yes. Well, it's, uh, very intriguing. 

LANDLORD

Tell me, is it your contention that Shakespeare was an imposter? 

KRAMER

My contention? 

LANDLORD

Yes, your contention. 

KRAMER

Yes, that's my contention. 

ELAINE

I heard him contend that. 

LANDLORD

It's too bad about your father. 

ELAINE

Oh, it was a frame-up. 

LANDLORD

A fine man, he spoke often of you. He's very proud of the work you're doing. 

ELAINE

Oh, well, we're all proud of the work I'm doing. 

KRAMER

She does fine work. 

LANDLORD

Your father gave me strict orders not to turn the jacket over to anyone, but I suppose I can make an exception in your case. The closet's this way. 

ELAINE

How kind of you. 

LANDLORD

You know, your father has a very extensive wardrobe. 

BRAIN

What's the matter, fella? You look a little tired. Ha ha ha ha ha! 

ISABEL

Nelson, don't you see? You are a part of me, and I, I am a part of you. 

PENIS

It's killing me. (Makes a move) 

BRAIN

That's your move? 

PENIS

Yeah. 

BRAIN

Well that's trouble, my friend. That's big trouble. Checkmate! 

PENIS

(beginning to cough and struggle) Getting weak... Losing power... You haven't seen the last of me. I'll be back. You're nothing without me. Nothing! 

BRAIN

(before disappearing himself) Punk. 

JERRY

Isabel, uh, I don't think this is working. 

ELAINE

Daddy certainly does have an extensive wardrobe. 

LANDLORD

He is a fine dresser and I'm sure I don't have to tell you he's quite popular with the ladies. 

ELAINE

My father, really? I had no idea. 

LANDLORD

Yes, they're crazy about him. There was one in particular, came around about two years ago, looked a lot like you, Professor. Could have been your mother. What was her name again? Carter? Kramer! That's it, Babs 

KRAMER

You don't say? 

ELAINE

I found it! 

LANDLORD

The woman used to walk around here half naked, sucking Colt 45 from a can. Her big fat stomach hanging out, orthopedic hose up to her knees, screaming down the hall, 'Come back to bed, Albert, you big hairy ape, and bring back that box of Danish!' 

KRAMER

So I grabbed the guy by the collar. 

ELAINE

Yeah, and I yelled out, Kramer! Kramer, you're killing him!' 

JERRY

So I assume the jig was up. 

ELAINE

Yeah, pretty much. 

AUDREY

Hi. 

ELAINE

Hi! 

JERRY

Hey. 

AUDREY

(to George) Hello. 

GEORGE

(smitten) Audrey? My god, you look incredible! I can't believe it! 

AUDREY

(motioning to Kramer) Well, it was his doctor. He was wonderful. 

ELAINE

So, will I see you later tonight? 

AUDREY

Not sure. 

KRAMER

(rising and putting his arm around Audrey's shoulder) Well, I'll check you guys out later. (To Audrey) Ready? 

AUDREY

(holding up her hand to show the stamp) I didn't wash. 

KRAMER

Neither did I. We're off to the Reggae Lounge. 

ELAINE

(after they leave) Isn't she beautiful? Her nose is in such perfect proportion with the rest of her face. She's breathtaking! Who would have though she's like-- 

GEORGE

(interrupting) Elaine. Shut up. 

GEORGE

(to the cashier)&nbsp; Excuse me, I gave you a twenty dollar bill and you only actually gave me change for a ten. 

GEORGE

(waving:&nbsp; Eva. 

JERRY

(Patting his head:&nbsp; I'm a comedian. 

JERRY

(still Patting)&nbsp; I hear a voice. 

JERRY

(interrupting)&nbsp; Can I talk to you for a second? 

JERRY

(walking up)&nbsp; Pendant?&nbsp; Those bastards. 

ELAINE

(noticing Ava in a fur)&nbsp; Oh look at that.&nbsp; Look at what she's wearing. You see what she's wearing? 

JENNY

(To Steve)&nbsp; I want them out of here. 

JENNY

(To Steve)&nbsp; It's two o'clock in the morning. 

JERRY

(noticing a coffee table book)&nbsp; Oh, you got the Civil War book.&nbsp; I saw some of that show, it was wonderful. 

JERRY

(writing)&nbsp; Here's my address and number.&nbsp; And really, thanks again. 

KRAMER

(to Elaine)&nbsp; You better zip up.&nbsp; I couldn't get the top on the convertible up. 

GUARD

(grabbing George by the elbow and walking him to the counter) Come with me. 

GEORGE

(nervous)&nbsp; Where are you taking me?&nbsp; I was gonna pay for it. 

CASHIER

um-hmm. 

GEORGE

(more nervous)&nbsp; What are you talking about? 

GEORGE

(panicky)&nbsp; What are you gonna do?&nbsp; Are you gonna call the police? 

STEVE

(hysterical)&nbsp; Ah, they turned brown!!&nbsp; Brown!! (the laughter winds down) So let me ask you something, you know any women we could call? 

KRAMER

(handing Steve the phone)&nbsp; 555-LOVE. 

STEVE

(drunk and slurring)&nbsp; Oh Jerry!&nbsp; Jerry!&nbsp; Look who's here, it's Jerry 

JERRY

(taking out his wallet and handing over bills grudgingly)&nbsp; Fifty dollars. 

JERRY

Do you believe this? The car was parked right out front. 

GEORGE

Was the alarm on? 

JERRY

I don't know, I guess it was on. I don't know my alarm sound; I'm not tuned in to it like it's my son. 

GEORGE

I don't understand, how do these thieves start the car? 

JERRY

They cross the wires or something. 

GEORGE

Cross the wires? I can't even make a pot of spaghetti. 

JERRY

They stole my car. 

KRAMER

Who did? 

JERRY

They did. 

KRAMER

Was it more than just one? 

JERRY

What should I do, should I call the police? 

KRAMER

What are they gonna do? 

JERRY

I'd better call the car phone company, cancel my service. 

GEORGE

Maybe you should call your car phone. 

JERRY

Yeah, he's probably driving it right now. 

GEORGE

Wait a minute, call the car phone, see what happens. 

JERRY

Are you serious? 

GEORGE

Yeah, go ahead, call. 

JERRY

I don't even know if I remember the number. 

JERRY

What do I say if he picks up? 

THIEF

Hello? 

JERRY

Hello? Is this 555-8383? 

THIEF

I have no idea. 

JERRY

Can I ask you a question? 

THIEF

Sure. 

JERRY

Did you steal my car? 

THIEF

Yes I did. 

JERRY

You did?! 

THIEF

I did. 

JERRY

That's my car! 

THIEF

I didn't know it was yours. 

JERRY

What are you gonna do with it? 

THIEF

I dunno, drive around. 

JERRY

Then can I have it back? 

THIEF

Mmmm, nah, I'm gonna keep it. 

KRAMER

Hello? 

THIEF

Yeah, who's this? 

KRAMER

Kramer. 

THIEF

Hello, Kramer. 

KRAMER

Listen, there's a pair of gloves in the glove compartment. 

THIEF

Wait, hold on... Brown ones? 

KRAMER

Yeah. Listen, could you mail those to me? Or bring them by my building, it's 129 West 81st St. 

THIEF

One-two-nine, okay. 

KRAMER

Thanks a lot, uh here's Jerry. 

JERRY

(derisively at Kramer) Gloves. (Into the phone) Hello? 

THIEF

Jerry? 

JERRY

Yeah, let me ask you a question. How do you cross those wires? 

THIEF

I didn't cross any wires, the keys were in it. 

JERRY

Sid left the keys in the car. Alright, I gotta go. Drive carefully. 

THIEF

Jerry, when's the last time you had a tune-up? Because I can't find the-- 

JERRY

Sid left the keys in the car. 

GEORGE

Who's Sid? 

JERRY

He's this guy in the neighborhood, parks cars on the block. 

GEORGE

What do you mean? 

JERRY

He moves them from one side of the street to the other so you don't get a ticket. 

GEORGE

What, do you pay him for that? 

JERRY

Yeah, like fifty bucks a month. 

GEORGE

How many people does he do that for? 

JERRY

The whole block, forty, fifty cars. 

KRAMER

He only works three hours a day. He makes a fortune. Course he's been doing that for years, right Jerry? 

GEORGE

Could anybody do that? 

JERRY

Hey Sid, what happened? 

SID

I'm sorry, Jerry. Maybe I'm getting too old for this stuff. 

JERRY

You left the keys in the car? 

SID

Well, you know they're making that Woody Allen movie in the block, and all those people and trucks everywhere, when I saw him I must have got a little distracted. 

KRAMER

You know I'm in that movie? 

GEORGE

You are? 

KRAMER

Yeah, I'm an extra. 

GEORGE

How'd you get that? 

KRAMER

Well, I was just watching them film yesterday and some guy just asked me. 

GEORGE

Right out of the clear blue sky? 

KRAMER

Clear blue sky! 

GEORGE

Well, why didn't they ask me? 

KRAMER

I got a quality. 

SID

Jerry, you got insurance, right? 

JERRY

Yeah, but no car. I'll have to rent one. 

SID

Well I'm going down to visit my sister in Virginia next Wednesday, for a week, so I can't park it. 

JERRY

This Wednesday? 

SID

No, next Wednesday, week after this Wednesday. 

JERRY

But the Wednesday two days from now is the next Wednesday. 

SID

If I meant this Wednesday, I would have said this Wednesday. It's the week after this Wednesday. 

GEORGE

Sid, who's gonna move the cars while you're away? 

SID

Whoever wants to move them, why do I care who moves them? They can move themselves if they want. 

GEORGE

Maybe I could move them until you get back. 

SID

What's a young man like you want to move cars for? You don't work? 

GEORGE

I'm in a transition phase right now. 

SID

Well if you want to move the cars, move the cars. Just don't forget to take the keys out, that's all. 

JERRY

Hello? Yeah, the defroster's the one on the bottom, just slide it all the way over. You're welcome. 

ELAINE

I'm in awe of his intellect, when he talks it sounds like he's reading from one of his novels. 

JERRY

Owen March, I never heard of him. 

ELAINE

Well, he's not a baseball player. 

JERRY

Yeah, that's true. Well it sounds like it's going pretty good. 

ELAINE

Yeah. Well, there is one little problem. 

JERRY

What's that? 

ELAINE

He's sixty-six years old. 

AGENT

Next please. 

ELAINE

Well, go, go. 

AGENT

Can I help you? Name please? 

JERRY

Seinfeld. I made a reservation for a mid-size, and she's a small. I'm kidding around, of course. 

AGENT

Okay, let's see here. 

JERRY

Sixty-six years old? 

ELAINE

Yeah, well, he's in perfect health. He works out, he's vibrant. You'd really like him. 

JERRY

Why do people always say that? I hate everyone, why would I like him? 

ELAINE

What do you think, would you go out with a sixty-six year old woman? 

JERRY

Well, I'll tell you, she would have to be really vibrant. So vibrant, she'd be spinning. 

AGENT

I'm sorry, we have no mid-size available at the moment. 

JERRY

I don't understand, I made a reservation, do you have my reservation? 

AGENT

Yes, we do, unfortunately we ran out of cars. 

JERRY

But the reservation keeps the car here. That's why you have the reservation. 

AGENT

I know why we have reservations. 

JERRY

I don't think you do. If you did, I'd have a car. See, you know how to take the reservation, you just don't know how to *hold* the reservation and that's really the most important part of the reservation, the holding. Anybody can just take them. 

AGENT

Let me, uh, speak with my supervisor. 

JERRY

Uh, here we go. The supervisor. You know what she's saying over there? 

ELAINE

What? 

JERRY

Hey Marge, you see those two people over there? They think I'm talking to you, so you pretend like you're talking to me, okay now you start talking. 

ELAINE

Oh, you mean like this? So it looks like I'm saying something but I'm not really saying anything at all? 

JERRY

Now you say something else and they won't yell at me 'cause they thought I was checking with you. 

ELAINE

Okay, that's it. I think that's enough, see you later. 

AGENT

I'm sorry, my supervisor says there's nothing we can do. 

JERRY

Yeah, it looked as if you were in a real conversation over there. 

AGENT

But we do have a compact if you would like that. 

JERRY

Fine. 

AGENT

Alright. We have a blue Ford Escort for you Mr. Seinfeld. Would you like insurance? 

JERRY

Yeah, you better give me the insurance, because I am gonna beat the hell out of this car. 

AGENT

Please fill this out. 

ELAINE

What do you think, you think I'm making a big mistake? 

JERRY

Hey, if you enjoy being with him, that's what's important. 

ELAINE

I love being with him. I mean, I like being with him. It's okay being with him. 

ELAINE

I just don't enjoy being with him. 

JERRY

Well that's what's important. 

ELAINE

I'm meeting him for lunch at Chadway's around the corner, do I have to break up with him face to face or can I just wait and do it over the phone? 

JERRY

How many times you been out with him? 

ELAINE

Seven? 

JERRY

Face to face. 

ELAINE

Seven dates is a face-to-face break up? 

JERRY

If it was six I could have let you go, but seven, I'm afraid, is over the limit. Unless, of course, there was no sex. 

ELAINE

Hmm... How's the pasta over there? 

KRAMER

Whoa, whoa!! 

JERRY

What is going on out there? 

GEORGE

I need like a bucket of water! I got a car overheating, I got an alarm that won't go off, I'm pressing 'one', I'm pressing 'two', nothing! What do I do?! Help me! Help me! 

KRAMER

Hey, you know they were supposed to do my scene today? 

ELAINE

Today?! 

KRAMER

You know they told me that they wanted me to walk down the block carrying this bag of groceries. 

ELAINE

Yeah. 

KRAMER

So I start to walk, and I trip, and the grocery bag goes flying, and Woody, Woody starts laughing. 

ELAINE

He was laughing?! 

KRAMER

Oh yeah, he was drinking something, it started to come out of his nose. 

JERRY

So then what? 

KRAMER

I got a line in the movie! 

ELAINE

Get out! 

JERRY

That's great! 

GEORGE

You got a line in the Woody Allen movie? 

KRAMER

Pretty good, huh? 

GEORGE

You're in the movie? Is he in the scene? 

KRAMER

Oh yeah, yeah, it's me and him. I might have a whole new career on my hands, huh? 

JERRY

You mean *a* career. 

ELAINE

So was Mia Farrow there? 

KRAMER

Uh, I didn't see him. 

ELAINE

What's your line? 

KRAMER

Oh, well uh, okay I'm there with, uh, Woody, you know, I'm at this bar and, uh, I'm sit-- you know it's Woody Allen, did I mention that? 

KRAMER

So I'm sitting there with Woody and I say, I turn to him and I go, 'Boy, these pretzels are making me thirsty.' 

GEORGE

Is that how you're gonna say it? 

KRAMER

No, no, I'm working on it. 

ELAINE

Do it like this. 'These pretzels are making me thirsty.' 

JERRY

No. 'These pretzels are making me thirsty.' 

KRAMER

No, no. See, that's no good. See, you don't know how to act. 

GEORGE

'These pretzels are making me thirsty!!' 

GEORGE

That was no good? 

KRAMER

I didn't say anything. 

ELAINE

I'm gonna go break up with Owen. 

GEORGE

What was wrong with that? I had a different interpretation! Do you know anything about this pretzel guy?! Maybe he's been in the bar a really long time and he's really depressed because he has no job and no woman and he's parking cars for a living! (out the window to honking cars) Alright! Alright! Shut up! Shut up! I hear you! I'm coming down! These pretzels are making me thirsty! 

JERRY

Oh my god. 

ELAINE

Call an ambulance. 

JERRY

Boy, he took it hard. 

ELAINE

We were walking down the block right by your house and I was just about to break up with him then all of a sudden he started to twitch. 

JERRY

(on the phone) Hello? Yes, I need an ambulance at one twenty nine west Eighty-first Street, apartment five-A. 

ELAINE

Tell then to hurry! Hurry! 

JERRY

(To Elaine) It's an ambulance. (To the operator) I don't know but he's unconscious. 

KRAMER

These pretzels are making me thirsty. (He bites into a pretzel.) Boy, these pretzels are making me thirsty. 

JERRY

Kramer. 

KRAMER

What happened here? 

ELAINE

I don't know, I don't know, what should we do? We called an ambulance, does anyone know first aid? 

JERRY

Shouldn't you do something with the extremities? 

ELAINE

What extremities? 

KRAMER

What's an extremity? 

JERRY

You raise the feet, get blood to the head. 

KRAMER

You raise the head, you get blood to the feet. 

ELAINE

Okay, what about a cold compress? They always do that. 

JERRY

I don't have a washcloth. 

ELAINE

Well use a paper towel. 

JERRY

You can't put a paper towel on his head. 

KRAMER

What about a big sponge? 

JERRY

How you gonna hold it on there? 

KRAMER

Use a belt. 

ELAINE

No no no no no, that'll, it'll drip all over him. 

JERRY

Should we walk him around? 

KRAMER

(at the same time) Yes, yes. 

KRAMER

Yeah, I've seen them do that. 

JERRY

No, no that's for a drug overdose. 

KRAMER

Maybe that's what he's got. 

ELAINE

No no no no, Kramer, I just had lunch with him, he didn't leave the table. 

KRAMER

Well he could have dropped acid when you weren't looking. 

ELAINE

He is not a drug addict! 

JERRY

Hey, you know what? Maybe he's a diabetic, he might just need a cookie or something. 

ELAINE

A cookie! 

KRAMER

Can you give him a cookie? 

ELAINE

How's he gonna chew it? 

JERRY

We'll move his teeth, it happened to my uncle, the sugar revived him. 

ELAINE

Careful, you're getting crumbs all over him. 

KRAMER

I got him chewing but I don't think he's gonna swallow. 

ELAINE

You know what, let's put a few cookies in a blender and he could drink it. 

JERRY

Cookies don't liquefy. 

ELAINE

Yes they do, you can liquefy a cookie. 

KRAMER

Alright I'll get a blender. 

JERRY

What blender? I don't have a blender. 

KRAMER

You got a blender. 

JERRY

I would know if I had a blender. 

ELAINE

Where is the ambulance?! 

JERRY

(on phone) Hello, yes, I called for an ambulance like thirty-five minutes ago. 

ELAINE

I can't believe what's going on out here. 

JERRY

This is an emergency, what's taking so long? (the door buzzer buzzes) Wait a second, maybe that's them. (presses button) Hello? 

VOICE

Paramedics. 

JERRY

Come on up. Okay, they're here. 

ELAINE

He seems to be breathing. 

JERRY

Ya know, I gotta tell you, he's a pretty good-looking guy. 

ELAINE

I know. 

JERRY

Those eyebrows could use a trimming, you ever mention that to him? 

ELAINE

Almost. 

JERRY

Hey, look at this, c'mon, running wild there. 

ELAINE

It's not an easy thing to bring up. 

JERRY

Yeah, that's true. 

ELAINE

Aw, you should see his bathrobe, man, it's all silk. 

JERRY

Yeah? Does he wear slippers? I bet he wears slippers. 

ELAINE

He does, how'd you know that? 

JERRY

I could tell. 

ELAINE

What happened, what took you so long?! 

PARAMEDIC

We got here twenty minutes ago but we couldn't move, the whole intersection is gridlocked, I've never seen anything like it. So finally we make the turn and this guy who's running around triple-parking cars slammed into us with a blue Escort. 

JERRY

Blue Escort? That's my rent-a-car! 

GEORGE

Oh man. 

JERRY

What happened to the car? 

GEORGE

Sorry, you don't know what's going on out there! (looks at Owen) Who's he? 

ELAINE

This guy I'm seeing. 

GEORGE

What happened? 

JERRY

We don't know! 

PARAMEDIC

Who put cookies in his mouth? 

ELAINE

Cookies? 

PARAMEDIC

You're not supposed to do that. 

JERRY

So how'd you hit the car? 

GEORGE

I was moving it across the street, I looked up and I saw Woody Allen and I got all distracted. 

JERRY

It's not even my car, it's a rental. 

KRAMER

What are you doing out there?! You're holding up the production of the movie! We can't shoot and Woody, he's really mad at you. 

GEORGE

Woody mentioned me? What did he say? 

KRAMER

He said, 'Who's the moron in the blue jacket who's got the street all screwed up?' 

GEORGE

Should I apologize to Woody? 

KRAMER

Alright, I'll tell you what. Next time I talk to him, maybe I'll bring it up. I'll feel him out. 

SID

Now you didn't tell me you didn't know how to drive. You should have mentioned that. 

GEORGE

Well I know how to drive. 

SID

Then how'd all those cars get damaged? Why are people calling me up screaming on the phone? Most of them cancelled out on me. 

JERRY

Can I get anybody anything? 

SID

Moving cars from one side of the street to the other don't take no more sense than putting on a pair of pants. My question to you is who's putting your pants on? 

GEORGE

I put my pants on, Sid. 

SID

I don't believe you. If you can put your pants on, you can move those cars. 

GEORGE

Well I don't want to get into a big dispute about the pants. 

SID

Who's gonna send money to my sister in Virginia? Her little boy needs surgery on his foot. Now he'll be walking around with a limp because you can't park a few cars. 

GEORGE

Maybe I could call my father. 

KRAMER

Hey, you seen the paper yet? 

JERRY

Interestingly enough, no, inasmuch as it is my paper. 

KRAMER

Yeah. There's an article in there about that writer. 

JERRY

(reading) Owen March, prominent author and essayist suffered a stroke yesterday in the upper West Side apartment of a friend. 

KRAMER

Uh huh, that's the guy that was here. You're the friend. 

JERRY

(continuing) The extent of the damage would have been far less severe had paramedics been able to reach him sooner. 

SID

Oh lord. 

JERRY

(finishing) The commotion also delayed production of a Woody Allen movie that was shooting up the block. A spokeswoman for the legendary filmmaker said that Mr. Allen was extremely agitated and wondered if his days of shooting movies in New York were over. 

ELAINE

Five seconds. Jerry, I was five seconds away from breaking up with him. Five seconds. The next words out of my mouth were, 'Owen, it's over.' 

JERRY

Can he communicate? 

ELAINE

Yeah, well, he nods. And I think he understands me, he seems to enjoy it when I read to him. 

JERRY

Alright, she's free. (Steps up to the counter) Hi, I called before, uh, my car got smashed. 

ELAINE

So listen, what should I do? I mean if I break up with him now it'll look like I'm abandoning him because of his condition, I'll be ostracized from the community. 

JERRY

What community? There's a community? 

ELAINE

Of course there's a community. 

JERRY

All these years I'm living in a community, I had no idea. 

AGENT

Sir the estimate on the damage to your car is two thousand eight hundred and sixty-six dollars. 

JERRY

Hmm, well, I got the insurance and everything so... 

AGENT

Yes, now, uh, in your report you said that you were not the driver of the car at the time of the accident. 

JERRY

That is right, somebody else was driving. 

AGENT

Alright, well, sir, you're only covered for when you're driving the car. 

JERRY

Uh huh, what's that? 

AGENT

You're not covered for other drivers. 

JERRY

Other drivers? 

AGENT

Um hm. 

JERRY

Your whole business is based on other drivers. It's a rented car. That's who's driving it, other drivers. Doesn't my credit card cover me or something? 

AGENT

Not that particular one. 

JERRY

Well I got a hundred cards, here, pick a card, take a card, any card you want, go ahead, whichever one, I don't care. 

AGENT

Sir, if you had read the rental agreement-- 

JERRY

Did you see the size of that document? It's like the Declaration of Independence, who's gonna read that? 

AGENT

Mr. Seinfeld, as it stands right now, you are not covered for that damage and there is absolutely nothing that can be done about that. 

JERRY

These pretzels are making me thirsty. 

ELAINE

Ahh, it's good, isn't it? Yankee Bean. Why Yankee Bean, huh? Don't they have beans in the south? I mean if you order Yankee Bean in the south, are they offended? Huh? (singing) Yankee Bean, Yankee Bean, I like my Yankee Bean. (she puts the bowl down and wipes Owen's mouth with a napkin) Owen, I think we have to talk. I mean, uh, *I* have to talk. It would be nice if *we* could, but, uh, whatever. Um, don't get me wrong, I like coming here, and uh, feeding you and cleaning a little, and paying your bills, that's good stuff. Good stuff! I have a wonderful time when I'm with you, wonderful! But at this point in my life, I'm not really sure that I'm ready to make a commitment to one person. I'm just not really sure that we have enough in common. For example, I like running in the park, bicycling, roller skating, tennis and skiing, and um, well, I'm gonna be brutally honest with you now, Owen, it's a bitch to get here. It's two subways. I have to transfer at Forty-second Street to take the double-R. Anyway, I mean, this doesn't mean we can't be friends. These pretzels are making me thirsty. 

ELAINE

Can you die from an odor? I mean, like if you were locked in a vomitorium for two weeks, could you actually die from the odor? 

JERRY

An overdose of odor? Good question. 

GEORGE

Do I smell? 

ELAINE

No no no no, I was just down on the forty-second street subway today, it is disgusting. Guess who I bumped into. Owen. 

JERRY

Ahh. 

GEORGE

He's alright? 

ELAINE

Yeah, he's almost fully recovered. He told me he was just using me for sex. 

JERRY

Let me get that. 

GEORGE

No no no, I got it. 

JERRY

Please. 

GEORGE

No come on, let me, let me. I smashed your car, it cost you over two thousand dollars, 

JERRY

(sarcastically) Yeah, a cup of coffee should cover it. 

JERRY

What are you doing here? 

KRAMER

I got fired from the movie. 

GEORGE

Get out of here, why? 

KRAMER

Well, you know they were gonna shoot it today, and uh, we rehearsed it twice, then Woody yells 'Action!' and I turn to him and I say, 'These pretzels are making me thirsty' and I took a swig of beer, ya know, and I slammed the glass down on the bar and it shattered. 

ELAINE

Aww. 

KRAMER

Well, one of the pieces must have hit Woody. He started crying. And he yells out, 'I'm bleeding' and he runs off. Anyway, this woman, she came up to me and she says, 'You're fired.' Boy I really nailed that scene. 

JERRY

Aw, wait a--. Oh. Oh, for crying out loud. 

JERRY

Oh yeah, like you know what you're talking about. 

GEORGE

Like you do. 

JERRY

Well what do you think? They put the statue on a giant raft and a tugboat pulled it all the way from France? 

GEORGE

What do you think? The brought it over in pieces and screwed it together like a coffee table? 

JERRY

I don't know. It's too early for a Christmas party isn't it? 

GEORGE

Why did France give that to us anyway? 

JERRY

It was a gift. 

GEORGE

So countries just exchange gifts like that? 

JERRY

If they like each other. 

GEORGE

There's Elaine. 

JERRY

See that guy he's talking with? That's her new boyfriend. 

GEORGE

Really? They work here in the office? 

JERRY

Yeah. They're having a little fling so don't say anything. 

GEORGE

Who am I going to tell? My mother? Like I've got nothing better to talk about. 

JERRY

You don't. He's a recovering alcoholic. 

GEORGE

Really? 

JERRY

Yeah. He's been off the wagon for two years. 

GEORGE

'Off the wagon'? 

JERRY

I think it's off the wagon. 

GEORGE

I think it's 'on the wagon'. 

ELAINE

Jerry, George, what are you doing here? 

JERRY

What am I doing here? Ba-boom (holding out a present) 

ELAINE

*gasp* My god! My watch! You found my watch! (pushing Jerry) 

JERRY

Hey keep your hands to yourself if you know what's good for you. 

ELAINE

Where did you find it? 

JERRY

Under the sofa cushion. 

ELAINE

And you stopped by just to give it to me? 

JERRY

It's your Christmas present. 

ELAINE

I though I'd never find it. 

GEORGE

Well today's your lucky day. 

ELAINE

No. Today's *your* lucky day. 

GEORGE

It will be my first one. 

ELAINE

You want to work here? 

GEORGE

Huh? 

ELAINE

Yeah one of the readers left and there's a job opening. Dick, this is Jerry and this is George. 

DICK

Hi nice to meet you. Is this the guy? 

JERRY

'The guy?' 

ELAINE

(softly to Dick) Dick. 

GEORGE

How can you just get it? 

ELAINE

My boss told me to find someone. I'm in charge of it. All you have to do is meet him. Come on. Come on, come on, here hold my drink. 

JERRY

Cranberry juice? 

ELAINE

And vodka. 

DICK

I got the cranberry juice. 

DICK

So... you're Jerry. 

JERRY

So... I'm Jerry. (he puts down the drink) 

LIPPMAN

(What is his name?) So have you ever done this kind of work before? 

GEORGE

Well, you know, book reports. That kind of stuff. 

LIPPMAN

How do you read? 

GEORGE

I like Mike Lubika. 

LIPPMAN

Mike Lubika? 

GEORGE

He's a sports writer for the daily news. I find him very insightful... 

LIPPMAN

No, no, no. I mean authors. 

GEORGE

Lot of good ones. I don't even want to mention anyone because I'm afraid I'm going to leave somebody out. 

LIPPMAN

Name a couple. 

GEORGE

Who do I like? I, like, uh, Art, Vandelay. 

LIPPMAN

Art Vandelay? 

GEORGE

He's an obscure writer. Betnik, on the village. 

LIPPMAN

What has he written? 

GEORGE

Venetian Blinds. 

DICK

(picking up the drink) I've got new for you. I'm funnier than you are. 

JERRY

Why don't get we together New Years day and watch some football. 

ELAINE

Where's my drink? 

JERRY

There. (turns to George) So, how did it go? 

GEORGE

I think he was impressed. 

ELAINE

No, no, no, this is just cranberry juice. 

JERRY

Oh, uh, I think maybe Dick picked up yours. 

ELAINE

Dick? He can't drink. He's an alcoholic. I told you to hold it. 

JERRY

I didn't know you meant *hold* it, I thought you meant hold it. 

ELAINE

One drink like that and he could fall right off the wagon. 

GEORGE

Told you. 

JERRY

I never feel comfortable in the women's department. I feel like I'm just a *little* too close to trying on a dress. 

GEORGE

Do I really have to buy her something? 

JERRY

Hey the woman got you a job. The least you could do is buy her a gift. How about this? 

GEORGE

What is that? Is that cashmere? 

JERRY

Yeah. She would love cashmere. 

GEORGE

Who doesn't like cashmere? Find me one person in the world that doesn't like cashmere. It's too expensive. 

JERRY

Look at this. It's 85 dollars marked down from 600. 

GEORGE

Wow. Excuse me, Miss? 

WOMAN

Yes? 

GEORGE

How come this sweater is only 85 dollars? 

WOMAN

(showing the dot) Oh, here. This is why. 

GEORGE

What? I don't see anything. 

WOMAN

See this red dot? 

GEORGE

Oh yeah. 

JERRY

Oh it's damaged. (grabbing the sweater) 

GEORGE

(grabbing the sweater back) Well it's not really damaged. 85 dollars huh? 

WOMAN

There's no exchanges on this. 

GEORGE

You think she would care about the red dot? 

JERRY

It's hard to say. 

GEORGE

I don't even think she'd notice it. Can you see it? 

JERRY

Well I can see it. 

GEORGE

Yeah, but you know where it is. 

JERRY

Well what do you want me to do? Not look at it? 

GEORGE

Pretend you didn't know it was there. Can you see it? 

JERRY

It's hard to pretend because I know where it is. 

GEORGE

Well just take an overview. Can't you just take an overview? 

JERRY

You want me to take an overview? 

GEORGE

Please. 

JERRY

I see a very cheap man holding a sweater trying to get away with something. That's my overview. 

JERRY

Yeah so? 

ELAINE

He's acting very strangely. I think he started drinking again. 

JERRY

Oh boy, can you smell it? 

ELAINE

No. I can't smell it. 

JERRY

Well if you can't smell it then he hasn't been drinking. 

ELAINE

You don't always smell someone from a drink. 

JERRY

Yes you do. 

ELAINE

What about one drink? Would you smell it from one drink? 

JERRY

Yes you would. 

JERRY

I'll prove it. Would you do me a favor? 

KRAMER

Okay. 

JERRY

Would you take a drink and let us smell you? 

KRAMER

You can smell me without the drink. 

ELAINE

I suspect that this guy I'm seeing might be drinking but I can't smell it. 

KRAMER

Okay, well what am I drinking? What do you got? 

JERRY

I got a bottle of scotch my uncle gave me. It's Hennigans. It's been here for two years. I've been using it as a paint thinner. 

KRAMER

All right. 

JERRY

I don't smell anything. 

ELAINE

Maybe we're too close to the bottle. 

JERRY

Yeah. 

GEORGE

(over the speaker) It's George. 

JERRY

Come on up. 

KRAMER

That is *damn* good scotch. I could do a commercial for this stuff. Mmmmm, boy that Hennigans goes down smooth. And afterwords you don't even smell. That's right folks. I just had three shots of Hennigans and I don't smell. Imagine, you can walk around drunk all day. That's Hennigans, the no-smell, no-tell scotch. 

GEORGE

Hello everybody. 

KRAMER

Hey. (snuggling really close to George) I'm going to tell you what I think. I know you don't care what I think, but I'm going to tell you. I think that you are terrific. 

GEORGE

(uncomfortablly) Thank you. 

ELAINE

Hey what's that? 

GEORGE

It's an early Christmas present. 

ELAINE

Christmas present? For who? 

GEORGE

For you. 

ELAINE

*gasp* (pushing George) Get out of here. 

KRAMER

Say you got a big job interview, and you're a little nervous. Well throw back a couple shots of Hennigans and you'll be as loose as a goose and ready to roll in no time. And because it's odorless, why, it will be our little secret. (singing) h-e-double n... 

JERRY

Kramer. Yeah that'll do. 

ELAINE

(opening the present) Oh George, this is beautiful. Is this cashmere? 

GEORGE

Of course it's cashmere. 

ELAINE

Oh, I love cashmere. 

GEORGE

Well who doesn't. 

ELAINE

My, George this must have cost a fortune. 

GEORGE

Ahh, money. 

ELAINE

Jerry, how could you let him spend so much money? 

JERRY

I tried to stop him. I couldn't. He just wants to make people happy. 

ELAINE

George, this is one of the nicest things anyone has ever given me. 

GEORGE

Well good, good. Take it off you're going to wear it out already. It's for special occasions this thing. 

KRAMER

What's that red dot on your sweater? 

ELAINE

What? 

GEORGE

Just take it off. I'm getting hot just looking at it. 

ELAINE

Uhh. This. It's like a red dot. 

GEORGE

What red dot? What are you talking about? Jerry come here for a second. Do you see anything here? 

JERRY

(uncomfortable) Uh, I don't know. Uh, I don't know. 

ELAINE

What don't you know? 

JERRY

I don't know. 

ELAINE

Well do you see it or don't you? 

JERRY

Ahem. Say that again? 

ELAINE

Do you see it or don't you? 

JERRY

Do I see it... or don't I? That's the question. 

JERRY

Now what did you ask me again. 

ELAINE

You're still here. You're a dynamo. 

GEORGE

I can't believe I get paid for this. 

ELAINE

I'll see you tomorrow. 

GEORGE

How you doing? 

WOMAN

Hello. 

JERRY

You had sex with the cleaning woman on your desk? Who are you, how did you do that? 

GEORGE

Hennigans. I was there sitting in the office and the cleaning woman comes in. I've always been attracted to cleaning women. Cleaning women, chambermaids. 

JERRY

Yeah chambermaids, I'm attracted to them too. 

GEORGE

Why is that? 

JERRY

It's a woman in your room. So go ahead. 

GEORGE

So she starts vaccuming, back and forth, back and forth, her hips swivelling, her breasts, uh... (trying to think of a word) 

JERRY

Convulsing? 

GEORGE

Convulsing? 

JERRY

I don't know, I'm trying to help you. 

GEORGE

Then I asked her if she wanted a drink. 

JERRY

You don't drink. 

GEORGE

I know but I couldn't think of anything else to say to her. 

JERRY

So you started drinking. 

GEORGE

So we started drinking, and I'll tell you I don't know if it was the alcohol or the ammonia, but the next think I knew she was mopping the floor with me. 

JERRY

So how was it? 

GEORGE

Well the sex was okay, but I threw up from the Hennigans. 

JERRY

Good thing the cleaning lady was there. 

ELAINE

Dick was fired. 

JERRY

You mean to tell me if I had put that drink six inches over to the right, and none of this would have happened. 

ELAINE

You knew he was an alcoholic. Why'd you put the drink down at all? 

JERRY

What are you saying? 

ELAINE

I'm not saying anything. 

JERRY

You're saying something. 

ELAINE

What could I be saying? 

JERRY

Well you're not saying nothing you must be saying something. 

ELAINE

If I was saying something I would have said it. 

JERRY

Well why don't you say it? 

ELAINE

I said it. 

JERRY

What did you say? 

ELAINE

Nothing. It's exhausting being with you. 

JERRY

Yeah? 

GEORGE

(over the speaker) It's George. 

JERRY

Come on up. 

ELAINE

Hey, let me ask you something something. Did George buy that sweater knowing the red dot was on it because it was cheaper? (Jerry is unconfortable) Ooookay, you just gave me the answer. 

JERRY

No I didn't. 

ELAINE

Yes you did, yes you did. I saw your expression. 

JERRY

I didn't have an expression. I have a deviated septum. I have to open my mouth sometimes to breathe. 

ELAINE

How much did he save? 

JERRY

Frankly I am shocked that you would ask such a question (Elaine sticking out her tongue like she isn't buying a word of it) of me, that you would think - the only surprise is how you could even think of that. That's what you were seeing. 

GEORGE

I have to talk to Elaine. This cleaing lady is turning the screws on me. She's pushing for this whole relationship thing. She keeps calling me, threatening to go to the boss with this thing, I could lose my job, I gotta do something to keep her quiet. 

JERRY

Elaine is in the bathroom. She's wise to whole red dot thing. She's asking me all kinds of questions. 

GEORGE

Did you tell her anything? 

JERRY

No. 

GEORGE

Do you swear? 

JERRY

I'm not swearing. I don't want to swear. 

GEORGE

Oh you told her didn't you. 

JERRY

No. 

ELAINE

Hey George, did you buy that sweater knowing that red dot was on it because you could get it at a discount? 

GEORGE

What? Did I what? 

ELAINE

You did didn't you. 

GEORGE

Elaine, I'm, I'm shocked. I'm shocked. Here I go out in the spirit of the season (Elaine looking like she's not buying a word of it) and spend all my savings to buy you the most beautiful Christmas sweater I have ever seen to show my appreciation to you at Christmas and this is the thanks that I get at Christmas. 

ELAINE

Well Jerry told me that you did. 

GEORGE

You told her? How could you tell her? I told you not to say anything. 

JERRY

I didn't tell her you stupid idiot. She tricked you. 

GEORGE

Elaine you don't understand. I had 103 temperature when I bought that sweater. I was so dizzy I was seeing red dots everywhere. I thought everything in the store had a red dot on it. I couldn't distinguish one red dot from another. I couldn't afford anything. I have nothing. I haven't worked for a really long time. (Jerry is standing right behind George. Jerry takes out a hankerchief and starts fake-crying in it.) I mean look, I have no clothes, look at what I'm wearing. It's just a little red dot. 

GEORGE

This is for you. 

WOMAN

Oh, Georgie, you bought this for me? Oh I knew you cared for me. 

GEORGE

As you care for me. Which is why it is very important that you never breathe a word of this to anyone about the... you know. What, with Clarence Thomas and everything. 

WOMAN

Okay, okay, can I open it now? 

GEORGE

Yes of course go ahead. My guess is you're going to like this very much. 

WOMAN

Oh! Is that cashmere? 

GEORGE

Of course it's cashemere. 

WOMAN

A cashmere sweater. Oh Georgie Porgie! 

GEORGE

Just a little something for Christmas. 

WOMAN

When I was a little girl in Panama, a rich American came to our town and he was wearing the softest most beautiful sweater. I said to him, 'what do you call this most beautiful fabric?', and he said 'they call it cashmere'. I repeated the words 'cashmere, cashmere'. I asked if I could have it, and he said 'No. Get away from me.' Then he started walk away. But I grabbed onto his leg screaming for him to give me the sweater and he dragged me through the street. And then he kicked at me with the other foot and threw some change at me. Oh, but I didn't want the change Georgie. I wanted the cashmere. 

GEORGE

I had a feeling you would like it. No, don't try it on now, try it on later. 

WOMAN

Wow, look at this. It feels so beautiful. 

GEORGE

Take it off. You're going to ruin it. 

WOMAN

(noticing the dot) What's this? 

JERRY

I was in the men's room the other day and they had the hand blower, instead of the paper towels, you know this thing. I like the hand blower I have to say. It takes a little bit longer, but I feel when you're in a room with a revolting stench you want to spend as much time as you can. 

DICK

The only stench is comming from you. 

AUDIENCE

Oooooh. 

JERRY

Oh, wait a second, I believe we have a heckler ladies and gentlemen. Hey Dick I don't know what your problem is. It's not my fault you're back on the wagon. 

DICK

It's off the wagon. 

JERRY

In the old days how do you think they got the alcohol from town to town? 

DICK

I don't know. 

JERRY

On the wagon. Don't you think they broke into a couple of those bottles along the way? 

DICK

You can't drink on a wagon it would be too bumpy. 

JERRY

They had smooth trails. What about the Cumberland Gap? 

DICK

What the hell do you know about wagons? 

JERRY

I know enough not to get on them. 

LIPPMAN

I'm going to get right to the point. It has come to my attention that you and the cleaning woman have engaged in sexual intercourse on the desk in your office. Is that correct? 

GEORGE

Who said that? 

LIPPMAN

She did. 

GEORGE

Was that wrong? Should I have not done that? I tell you I gotta plead ignorance on this thing because if anyone had said anything to me at all when I first started here that that sort of thing was frouned upon, you know, cause I've worked in a lot of offices and I tell you peope do that all the time. 

LIPPMAN

You're fired. 

GEORGE

Well you didn't have to say it like that. 

LIPPMAN

I want you out of here by the end of the day. 

GEORGE

What about the whole Christmas spirit thing? Any flexability there? 

LIPPMAN

Nah. Wait, wait, she wanted me to give you this. 

ELAINE

You had sex on your desk with the cleaning woman. 

GEORGE

You never had sex in the office before? 

ELAINE

No. I once made out with someone but that was it. 

GEORGE

Alright so you made out with someone. 

ELAINE

Well that's not sex. 

GEORGE

Kissing is sex. 

ELAINE

Kissing is not sex. 

JERRY

George? 

GEORGE

Jerry. 

ELAINE

Hey, did Jerry leave that drink next to Dick's on purpose? 

GEORGE

No. 

JERRY

George? 

GEORGE

Over here. 

ELAINE

What are you doing here? 

JERRY

I'm taking the kid out to dinner to chear him up. 

ELAINE

Hey Jerry when do you consider that sex has taken place? 

JERRY

I would say when the nipple makes its first appearance. 

ELAINE

So, George told me that you left the drink next to Dick's on purpose. 

JERRY

Nice try. So guess who heckled me at the club last night. 

DICK

Merry Christmas. 

ELAINE

Oh my god that's Dick. It's Cape Fear. 

GEORGE

Hide, hide under the desk. 

ELAINE

Ow, ow move over. 

JERRY

Get off of me. 

ELAINE

I've got no room. 

DICK

Is that cashmere? 

GEORGE

Of course it's cashmere. 

DICK

(noticing the dot) What's this? 

JERRY

But in a way, I think I inadvertantly turned this guy into an alcoholic. I hate being around alcoholics because they're either telling you how much they love you or how much they hate you. And those are the two statements that scare me the most. But I think he's okay now because I have no idea how he feels about me. He's finally off the wagon. 

DICK

You mean on the wagon. 

JERRY

Don't get smart. 

KRAMER

All right, Coney Island. Ok, you can take the B or the F and switch for the N at Broadway Lafayette, or you can go over the bridge to DeKalb and catch the Q to Atlantic Avenue, then switch to the IRT 2, 3, 4 or 5, but don't get on the G. See that's very tempting, but you wind up on Smith and 9th street, then you got to get on the R. 

ELAINE

Couldn't he just take the D straight to Coney Island? 

KRAMER

Well, yeah... 

ELAINE

Ok, what time is your job interview George? 

GEORGE

9:45 

JERRY

Remember, don't whistle on the elevator. 

GEORGE

Why not? 

JERRY

That's what Willie Loman told Biff before his interview, in 'Death of a salesman'. 

GEORGE

What, you are comparing me to Biff Loman, very encouraging. The biggest loser in history of American literature. 

ELAINE

All right, I'm gonna go. 

JERRY

What time is the lesbian wedding? 

ELAINE

9:30 

GEORGE

Lesbian wedding. How do they work bride and groom out, what do they flip a coin? 

ELAINE

Yeah, they flip a coin. 

GEORGE

What, was that not politically correct? It's a legitimate question. 

JERRY

I'm so tired. I'll fall asleep on that train (yawns) 

GEORGE

I get the feeling when lesbians are looking at me, they're thinking: 'That's why I'm not heterosexual'. 

KRAMER

Jerry, come on let's go, pick up the check so we can go. 

JERRY

Oh, I'm paying for breakfast? 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

ELAINE

Yeah. 

GEORGE

Yeah. 

JERRY

Why do I always pay? What am I made of money? You bunch of deadbeats. 

GEORGE

How many tickets are you paying today? 

KRAMER

Well, let's see: speeding, running a red light, no license, no registration, no plates, no brake lights, no rear view mirror...yeah. (gives George a ticket) 

GEORGE

No doors? 

KRAMER

I'm fighting that one. You know, this is gonna cost me over six hundred bucks. 

GEORGE

I can't carry any changes in these pants, it falls out. 

PLAYER

Thank you. 

GEORGE

That guy is not blind. 

JERRY

So, can I convince anybody to come down to Coney Island with me? I got to pick up my car at the pound. George? 

GEORGE

I can't believe they actually found your stolen car. 

JERRY

Not only that they found it. It was simonized and the front end was aligned. 

GEORGE

That's amazing. 

JERRY

So what do you say? Run in the cyclone. Hotdogs on Nathan's is on me. 

GEORGE

What are you? Satan? I'm close to a job here. It's my second interview with them. 

JERRY

All right, biff. Elaine, merry-go-round? 

ELAINE

I can't. I'm the best man. 

JERRY

Kramer, bumper-cars? 

KRAMER

I've gotta go to court, I'll get in trouble. What's the matter with you? 

JERRY

Could be years before I get back to Coney Island. I can't go to rides alone. 

ANNOUNCEMENT

42th street. Change to D,N,RR,2,3,4,5,7,C,E,F train. 

ELAINE

See'ya. 

WOMAN

You looking for a job? 

GEORGE

Me, why? 

WOMAN

Well, you're reading the classifieds. 

GEORGE

Oh, no no no. I was just looking for stock-pages. Here it is. Looking for the quotes. Gotta check to quotes. Love a good quote. Oh, IBM up a quarter. 

WOMAN

You didn't look like someone who needed a job. 

GEORGE

Me? No, no, I don't, I don't. Doing very well, very well, yep. 

WOMAN

So, you're in 'the market'? 

GEORGE

Yeah I'm, eh, in 'the market'. 

WOMAN

Which market? 

GEORGE

Which market, the, eh, big one, the big market, the big board. Bull market, bear market, you name the market, I'm there. 

WOMAN

So, do you work for one of those big broker-houses? 

GEORGE

They wish. I hate the big broker-houses. Hate them with a passion. Big broker-houses killed my father. 

WOMAN

Really? 

GEORGE

Well, they hurt him bad. Really hurt his feelings. It's a long story. I- I don't like to talk about it, but I swore then that I would never work for big broker-houses. See, all they care about is money. I'm about more than money, I'm about people, always gone my own way and I've never looked back. 

WOMAN

I started riding these trains in the forties. Those days a man would give up their seat for a woman. Now we're liberated and we have to stand. 

ELAINE

It's ironic. 

ELAINE

This, that we've come all this way, we have made all this progress, but you know we've lost the little things, the niceties. 

WOMAN

No, I mean what does 'ironic' mean? 

ELAINE

Oh... 

WOMAN

Where are you up to, with such a nice present, birthday party? 

ELAINE

A wedding. 

ELAINE

Yeah 

WOMAN

Hah, I didn't know people still get married. It's hard today with men and women. 

ELAINE

You're telling me. 

WOMAN

So, are they a nice couple? 

ELAINE

Oh, very nice. 

WOMAN

What does he do, if you don't mind me asking? 

ELAINE

She. 

ELAINE

There is no he. 

ELAINE

Em, two women. It's, eh...lesbian wedding. 

ELAINE

Aha, yep. I'm the...eh...bes tman. 

ELAINE

No, no, no, you don't understand! I'm not a lesbian! I hate men, but I'm not a lesbian! 

VOICE

I'm really looking forward to this. I love weddings. Maybe I'll meet somebody, umm maybe not. 

VOICE

Oh, man. We're stopping? 

WOMAN

Well, this is where I get off. 

GEORGE

Oh, you do? 

WOMAN

Eh, hey why don't you...oh nothing. 

GEORGE

No, no, what, what? 

WOMAN

Well, I was going to say: why don't you get off with me, but you're obviously very busy on your way to some important meeting or something. 

GEORGE

Yeah, well.... 

WOMAN

Yeah I knew it was a bad idea. 

GEORGE

Hey, what's another million, give or take. I get off where and when I wanna get off. 

GEORGE

I'm stuck. Pull a little, just a second. Don't start the train! Don't start the train!! 

JERRY

O-K. You realize of course, you're naked? 

MAN

Naked, dressed. I don't see any difference. 

JERRY

You oughta' sit here. There is a difference. 

MAN

You got something against naked body? 

JERRY

I got something against yours. How about a couple of deep knee bends, maybe a squat thrust? 

MAN

Who's got time for squat thrusts? 

JERRY

All right, how about skipping breakfast. I'm guessing you're not a 'half-grapefruit and black coffee' guy. 

MAN

I like a good breakfast. 

JERRY

I understand, I like good breakfast. Long as you don't wind up trapped in a room with bib overalls and pigtails, been counseled by Dick Gregory. 

MAN

I'm not ashamed of my body. 

JERRY

That's your problem, you should be. 

JERRY

Don't get up, please, allow me. 

VOICE

Oh, this is great. This is what I need, just what I need. Ok, take it easy I'm sure it's nothing. Probably rats on the track, we're stopping for rats. God, it's so crowded. How can there be so many people? This guy really smells, doesn't anyone use deodorant in the city? What is so hard, you take the cap off, you roll it on. What's that? I feel something rubbing against me. Disgusting animals, these people should be in a gage. We are in a gage. What if I miss the wedding? I got the ring. What'll they do? You can't get married without the ring. Oh, I can't breath, I feel faint. Take it easy, it'll start moving soon. Think about the people on the concentration camps, what they went through. And hostages, what would you do if you were a hostage? Think about that. This is nothing. No, it's not nothing, it's something. It's a nightmare! Help me! Move it! Com'on move this fu(beep) thing!! Why isn't it moving?!? What can go wrong with a train!?! It's on tracks, there's no traffic! How can a train get stuck. Step on the gas!! What could it be? You'de think the conductor would explain it to us? 'I'm sorry there's a delay we'll be moving in 5 minutes'!! I wanna hear a voice. What's that on my leg?!! 

GEORGE

Are you often on business trip? Nice...oh, hey nice ice-bucket. 

WOMAN

Make your-self comfortable. 

VOICE

Make myself comfortable. What does that mean? Does she want me to take my clothes off? Is she taking her clothes off? What if I take my clothes off and she still has hers' on? Then I really look like an idiot. She could get offended and leave. So maybe I should leave them on, but what then if she takes her off? Then she'll feel humiliated. 'Make yourself comfortable'. I got this unbelievable woman and this 'comfortable'-thing can ruin me. I got it! I take my shoes off and sit on the bed. There, that's comfortable. She can't accuse me being unconvertible. 

GEORGE

Gotta tell you I'm pretty comfortable. 

KRAMER

Oh yeah, it's all set. They got the bug boy on him. 

GUY

The bug boy. 

KRAMER

Yeah, the little father has run his hard out. They're gonna break his maiden. 

GUY

Really? But, it's a little bit slow out there it rained last night. 

KRAMER

Oh, this baby loves the slob, loves it, eats it up. Eats the slob. Born in the slob. His father was a mudda'. 

GUY

His father was a mudda'? 

KRAMER

His mudda' was a mudda'. 

GUY

His mudda' was a mudda'? 

KRAMER

What did I just say? 

KRAMER

Hey, all right, 600 Pappanick to win. 

MAN

They still have no pitching. Goodin's a question mahk. ...You don't recover from those rotator cuffs so fast. 

JERRY

I'm not worried about their best pitching. They got pitching. ...They got no hitting. 

MAN

No hitting? They got hitting! Bonilla, Murry. ...They got no defence. 

JERRY

Defence? Please. ...They need speed. 

MAN

Speed? They got Coleman. ...They need a bullpen. 

JERRY

Franco's no good? ...They got no team leaders. 

MAN

They got Franco! ...What they need is a front office. 

JERRY

But you gotta like their chances. 

MAN

I LUV their chances. 

JERRY

Tell you what. If they win the penant I'll sit naked with you at the World Series. 

MAN

It's a deal! 

VOICE

Why couldn't I take a cab. For 6 dollars my whole life could've changed. What is that on my leg? I'll never get out of here. What if I'm here for the rest of my life? Maybe I'll get out in 5 seconds. 1 banana, 2 banana, 3 banana, 4 banana, 5 banana...no, I'm still here! Still here! Why don't they start moving? Move! Move!! Move!!! *Train starts moving, lights get back on* It's moving! It's moving! Yes! Yes!! *Train stops again and lights go off* Motherf(beep-beep)!!! 

GEORGE

Eh, gee, I hope you have the key for these things. 

WOMAN

Oh, don't worry. I do. 

GEORGE

You know, my mother used to walk around on our apartment just in her bra and panties. She didn't look anything like you, she was really disgusting, really bad body. If you could imagine uglier and fatter version of Shirley Booth. Remember Shirley Booth from Hazel. Really embarrassing, cause you know I had only mother in the whole neighborhood who was worse looking than Hazel. Imagine the taunts I would hear. 

WOMAN

Like what? 

GEORGE

Like a 'Hey your mother is uglier than Hazel. Hazel really puts your mother to shame' 

GEORGE

What's going on? 

WOMAN

It was a pleasure doing business with you George, but I'm afraid I have to get going. 

GEORGE

Get going? But we haven't really, you know.... 

WOMAN

Eight dollars? Eight dollars? 

GEORGE

What are you doing? You're robbing me? 

WOMAN

I wasted my whole morning with you for eight dollars? 

GEORGE

Wait, wait a second, what are you doing? 

WOMAN

I'm taking your clothes. 

GEORGE

No, that's my only suit. It cost me 350 dollars. I got it at Moe Ginsburg. 

WOMAN

Bye George. 

GEORGE

No wait, you can't just leave me here! Will I see you again? 

KRAMER

Yes! Yes! I won, hey (shouts to cashier) 

MAN

I haven't had a hotdog at Nathan's for 20 years. 

JERRY

First we ride the cyclone. 

MAN

Chilly out. 

JERRY

Aah, French fries. 

THUG

Give me the money. Give me the money! 

PLAYER

(puts a gun to the thug's head) Freeze, Police! 

JERRY

No, I never got the car. We were having such a good time, by the time I got to the police garage, it was closed. 

ELAINE

Too bad. 

JERRY

You wouldn't believe what this guy put away at Nathan's. Look at what we won! 

JERRY

You want him? 

ELAINE

Get that out of my face. 

JERRY

So, you missed the wedding. You'll catch the bris! 

COUNTER

(yelling) Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna! 

GEORGE

How would you like a 'Hare Krishna' fist on your throat, you little punk? 

ELAINE

George? 

JERRY

Biff, what did you whistle on the elevator? 

GEORGE

You have my spare-key in your apartment, right? 

JERRY

Yeah, it's in the kitchen drawer. 

GEORGE

Give me your key, I gotta get it. 

KRAMER

What happened? 

GEORGE

Never mind what happened, just give me the key. 

JERRY

Come on, I'll go with you. 

ELAINE

Here, pay. (Gives the check to Jerry) 

KRAMER

Wait, wait, wait... 

GEORGE

...pianist. A *classical* pianist. She *plays* the piano. She's a *brilliant* woman. I-I-I sat in her living room... She played the *Waldstein Sonata*! The *Waldstein*! 

GEORGE

We did a crossword puzzle together, *in bed*. It was the most fun I ever had in my entire life. Did you hear me? in my *life*! Y'know? 

JERRY

Were you talking? I couldn't hear anything. 

GEORGE

I was telling you about Noel. 

JERRY

Oh, Noel! Yeah, the one who plays bongos... 

GEORGE

[sarcastically] Heh heh heh... So side-splittingly funny... 

JERRY

All right, I'm sorry. What about her? 

GEORGE

What, you think I'm going to repeat the whole thing now? 

JERRY

I know, you told me you like her, everything is going good. 

GEORGE

No everything is *not* going good. I'm very uncomfortable. I have no power. I mean, why should she have the upper hand. *Once* in my life I would like the upper hand. I have no hand-- no hand at all. She has the hand; I have *no* hand... 

GEORGE

How do I get the hand? 

JERRY

We all want the hand. Hand is tough to get. You gotta get the hand right from the opening. 

GEORGE

She's playing a recital this week at the McBierney School. You wanna hear her play? I got two extra tickets, you and Elaine could go... 

JERRY

Yeah, that sounds like somethin'... 

GEORGE

Then afterwards maybe we could all go out together. Y'know she'll see me with my friends, she'll observe me as I really am, as myself. Maybe I can get some hand that way. 

KRAMER

Hey, smell my arm... Smell it! 

GEORGE

With all due respect, I don't think so... 

JERRY

That smells good, what is that? 

KRAMER

The *beach*! 

JERRY

The *beach*? 

GEORGE

What, did you go swimmin'? It's 29 degrees out! 

KRAMER

I just joined the Polar Bear Club. 

JERRY

You joined the *Polar Bears*?! 

GEORGE

What the Hell is a 'Polar Bear'? 

KRAMER

Well, it's these people-- they go swimmin' in the winter. They're terrific, I just took my first swim today. Brrrrrrr! It's invigorating.... 

JERRY

Yeah... So's shock therapy. 

JERRY

[with glee] What is that, a Pez dispenser?! 

KRAMER

Want one? Yeah, I just bought it at the Flea Market. 

GEORGE

Hey, what goes on there, exactly? 

JERRY

You don't know? 

GEORGE

No, I-I-I know... [retreats back to his Chinese take out] I know... 

JERRY

You think they have fleas there, don't you? 

GEORGE

*No*... 

JERRY

Yes you do, Biff. You've never been to a Flea Market, and you think they have fleas there. 

GEORGE

All right, I think they have fleas there. So what... 

ELAINE

I don't know how anyone does this. It must be *so* nerve racking... How do they warm up their fingers? 

JERRY

They have a piano backstage they warm up on. 

ELAINE

*No*, we would have heard it. 

JERRY

What, do you think they just crack their knuckles and come out? 

GEORGE

I told her we'd all go out afterwards, okay? And don't applaud when she stops playing the first time. It's not over yet. 

JERRY

[quickly whispering] I resent that you said that! That's directed at *me*, isn't it?! 

JERRY

Is this okay? Can I do this? (he claps) 

STEVE

Something I said? [no response] It's John... Mollika. 

ELAINE

Oh, oh, *John*... Oh, hi John... Hi... 

STEVE

What're you doing down here? 

ELAINE

Oh, I was just at this recital and Jerry put a Pez dispenser on my leg and I started laughing. 

MOLLIKA

Jerry's in there? I heard you guys broke up. 

ELAINE

We did. We're just hanging out. 

MOLLIKA

REally. ... You really look great. 

ELAINE

Oh, uh, thank you. Are you still friends with Richie Appel? 

MOLLIKA

Oh, Richie, he's been doing comedy in L. A. for a few years. He just got back a month ago. He's kind of messed up. On drugs. I don't know what to do for the guy. 

ELAINE

Have you thought about an intervention? 

MOLLIKA

What's that? 

ELAINE

You get all his friends in a room, They confront himm to try to get him into rehab. It's a very popular thing now. 

MOLLIKA

He'd never listen to anyone. ... Except of course Jerry. He'd listen to Jerry. Jerry would have to be involved. He really respects Jerry. 

ELAINE

I'm sorry. George, I'm sorry! 

GEORGE

What did you put the Pez dispenser on her leg for in the first place? 

JERRY

I dunno, it was an impulse. 

GEORGE

What kind of a sick impulse does that?? 

JERRY

How could I know she would start to laugh? 

ELAINE

I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I *am*! 

JERRY

Can we just go in already? 

GEORGE

What are we gonna tell her? 

ELAINE

I'll tell her I was the one who laughed. 

GEORGE

No, don't say a word. If she thinks my friends are jerks, then I'm a *jerk*... 

ELAINE

[To Jerry] Oh, remind me to talk to you about something later. 

JERRY

What about? 

GEORGE

Hey, hey! We're discussing something! 

JERRY

I know, but I'm distracted now. 

GEORGE

What are you? A *baby*!? All right. Tell her. 

ELAINE

When I was outside I ran into John Mollika. 

JERRY

Really John Mollika, they guy that used to bartend at the Comedy Club. How's he doing? 

ELAINE

He's good. 

GEORGE

Uh, can we cut to the chase? 

JERRY

'Cut to the chase'? 

GEORGE

Yeah... 

JERRY

What're you, 'Joe Hollywood'? 

GEORGE

A lot of people say it. 

JERRY

I would lose that. 

GEORGE

[Accusingly] What's *that*? 

JERRY

'Lose that'? That's not a Hollywood expression! 

GEORGE

[Realizing full well it isn't] ...Yes it is. 

ELAINE

Anyway ... So John told me that Richie is in town from Los Angeles and he's really messed up on drugs. So I told him that he should do an intervention. 

JERRY

Really, an intervention ... 

GEORGE

Y'know people, we got a situation over here! 

ELAINE

Yeah, but he want's you to be a part of it. 

JERRY

Me? Why me? 

ELAINE

'Cause Richie really respects you and he would listen to you. 

JERRY

Y'know these things are *really* hard to load... 

GEORGE

All right, OK, I'm goin' in. 

JERRY

We've got to talk about this (to Elaine) 

ELAINE

All right. 

GEORGE

Hi, hi, hi, You were wonderful. 

NOEL

No.. 

GEORGE

Oh, these are my friends, Elaine and Jerry, ... Noel 

JERRY

You play a *Hell* of a piano. 

ELAINE

Yeah, I was really moved, *really* moved. 

NOEL

Well didn't you hear that person laughing? I couldn't play. I was *humiliated... 

ELAINE

Well, I'm sure it wasn't *at* you. 

NOEL

Well then, what was she laughing at? 

JERRY

Pez? 

NOEL

Uh, no, No thank you. Did you see her? 

GEORGE

Me, uh, uh, no, ... 

JERRY

Anyone who would laugh at a recital is probably some sort of lunatic anyway. I mean only a sick twisted mind could be that rude and ignorant. 

ELAINE

Maybe some mental defective put something stupid on her leg. 

JERRY

Even if this so called mental defective did put something on her leg she's still the one who laughed. 

NOEL

I'll never forget that laugh for the rest of my life. [exits] 

ELAINE

I'm sure she would apologize if she could. Probably somebody is holding her back against every fibre in her being. 

GEORGE

If she want's to continue to have a fibre of her being she'll be very careful (hitting each other) 

GEORGE

All right, so are you ready, so we'll go out and get something to eat. 

NOEL

I don't feel like it tonight. 

JERRY

We'll be outside 

ELAINE

Yeah 

JERRY

It was nice meeting you By the way, How do you warm up your fingers before you play? 

NOEL

I just crack my knuckles. 

GEORGE

We'll have a good time 

NOEL

I don't feel like it 

GEORGE

Ah, come on 

NOEL

I said I DON'T FEEL LIKE IT! 

GEORGE

Um, all right, um, uh, I'll call 'ya. I'll call you and we'll talk on the phone. A telephone communiqu&eacute;. Every thing is fine ok, uh, fine, .. [exits] 

JERRY

You know I thing Kramer might have been responsible for getting Richie involved with drugs in the first place. 

ELAINE

What? How? 

JERRY

A few years ago the comedy club had a softball team. Kramer was our first baseman You couldn't get anything by him It was unbelievable. Anyway this one game we came back to win from like 8 runs behind. So Kramer says to Richie why don't you dump the bucket of Gatorade on Marty Benson's head? The club owner. So Richie goes ahead and does it. 

ELAINE

So? What happened? 

JERRY

What happened? The guy was like 67 years old, it was freezing out, he caught a cold, got pneumonia, and a month later he was dead. 

ELAINE

Shut up! 

JERRY

All the comedians were happy. He was one of these club owners nobodu liked anyway. But Richie was never the same. 

ELAINE

Whar about Kramer? 

JERRY

He's the same! 

JERRY

Are you sure you want me John. I have spoken to Richie in two years. I don't have a good apartment for an intervention. The furniture, it's very non-confrontational. All right All right. Goodbye. [to Kramer] Remember Ricie Appel? 

KRAMER

(looks shocked) Oh sure, the guy I told to pour the Gatorade that killed Marty Benson? 

JERRY

Right, we'll John Mollika is organizing some kind of intervention for him. We're having it here. 

KRAMER

Can I get in on that? 

JERRY

What do you think? It's like a poker game? 

KRAMER

Is Elaine going? 

JERRY

Yeah 

KRAMER

Well, I knew him as well as she did. 

JERRY

Yeah, but John invited her. 

KRAMER

So what are you saying, you don't want me to intervene? 

JERRY

No, intervene, go intervene all you want. I am just afraid you might be interfering while we're intervening. 

GEORGE

It's George 

JERRY

Stop smelling your arm. 

KRAMER

You know I got a great idea for a cologne. The Beach. You spray it on and you smell like you just came home from the beach 

JERRY

Hum, a cologne that smells like the beach. I can't believe I'm saying this, 'That's not a bad idea.' 

KRAMER

Tell me about it! 

JERRY

Why don't you call Steve D'Jiff, he works in the marketing department at Calvin Klein. In fact he's a good friend of John Mollika and Richie also. 

GEORGE

Well it's over. It's definitely over. 

JERRY

She broke up with you? 

GEORGE

No, but I can tell she's going to. I can sense it. We had this terrible phone conversation. I was so nervous before I called I made up this whole list of things to talk about. 

JERRY

What was on the list? 

GEORGE

Let's see, How I'm very good at going in reverse in my car, why isn't Postum a more popular drink, 

JERRY

Yeah, Postum is under-ratted, 

GEORGE

Anyway there was all this tension. I asked her if she wanted to go out to dinner and she said 'no, maybe we could get together for lunch.' You know what that means. 

JERRY

What's wrong with lunch? 

GEORGE

Lunch is fine at the beginning then you move on to dinner. you don't move back to lunch. It's like being demoted. I'll never do another crossword puzzle with her again. I know it. 

KRAMER

I like the Jumble You ever do the Jumble? 

GEORGE

I have no power Do you understand? I need hand. I have no hand. 

KRAMER

Break up with her 

GEORGE

What? 

KRAMER

You break up with her. You reverse everything that way. 

JERRY

A preemptive breakup. 

GEORGE

A preemptive breakup. This is an incredible idea. I got nothing to lose. We either break up which she would do anyway but at least I go out with some Dignity. Completely turn the tables. It's absolutely brilliant. 

GEORGE

So, I am have to going to break up with you. 

NOEL

You're breaking up with me? 

GEORGE

I, ... am breaking up with, ... you. 

NOEL

Wow. 

GEORGE

Shocked? 

NOEL

I really am. 

GEORGE

Never expected this did you? 

NOEL

I thought everything was fine. 

GEORGE

Well, live and learn. 

NOEL

I don't understand. You're breaking up with me. Didn't we have fun doing the crossword puzzles? 

GEORGE

Kind of. 

NOEL

I'm very confused. 

GEORGE

Well, I didn't mean to hurt you kid. 

NOEL

I thought,... 

GEORGE

Now, stop it ... 

NOEL

What do you want, I can make you happy. 

GEORGE

When you're playing the piano do you think about me? 

NOEL

I don't know. 

GEORGE

This is what I'm talking about. 

NOEL

OK, I'll think about you. 

GEORGE

All the time. 

NOEL

All the time? ... OK, All the time. 

GEORGE

I can't hear you. 

NOEL

All the time. ALL THE TIME. 

GEORGE

See, It's not so hard. 

KRAMER

Go ahead smell, smell 

STEVE

Yeah, so? 

KRAMER

Do you recognize it? ... The beach. 

STEVE

What are you talking about? 

KRAMER

Oh, I'm talking about the beach. 

STEVE

What about it? 

KRAMER

You know the way you smell when you first come home from the beach? Well, I want to make a cologne that captures the essence of that smell. Oh yeah. 

STEVE

That is the dumbest idea I have ever heard. 

KRAMER

Oh, wait, Did you here what I just said? 

STEVE

Do you think people are going to pay $80 a bottle to smell like dead fish and sea weed? That's why people take showers when the come home from the beach. It's an objectionable offensive odour. 

KRAMER

So you don't think it's a good idea? 

GUY

The membranes get dried and it just starts bleeding. Since I was a kid so I have to stick tissue up there 

ELAINE

(very uninterested) Uh, you have to work like that? 

GUY

Nobody minds Nobody has ever said anything to me. 

GUY

Are there any ice cubes? 

JERRY

In the freezer. 

GUY

I looked. There aren't any ice cubes. 

JERRY

Well I guess there aren't any ice cubes. 

GUY

I can't drink this. It's warm! (walks away) 

GUY

Shouldn't we rehearse this a little bit before Richie comes? 

STEVE

What's the plan? 

JERRY

Do I have to talk? I don't feel like talking. 

GUY

Well, if he's not going to talk I'm not going to talk either. 

GUY

No, we all have to talk. 

ELAINE

What's the order? 

GUY

We'll go in alphabetical order. First Roberta. 

ROBERTA

Why am I first? 

ELAINE

Albano is your last name. 

ROBERTA

That's not my name any more. I'm divorced. 

STEVE

I'll go first. 

KRAMER

Hey. 

JERRY

Hey. 

KRAMER

Is this the interference? 

JERRY

Intervention. 

GUY

What are you doing here? 

KRAMER

Uh, is it all right if I stay for the intervention? 

STEVE

Hey, this is for close friends only. 

KRAMER

I'm a friend. Who do you think told him to pour the Gatorade over Marty Benson's head? 

GUY

Let him stay. 

KRAMER

Hey, you know I got someone to make up that cologne for me, big mouth. 

STEVE

Somebody's going to make that crap? 

GUY

Kramer! 

KRAMER

Hey, come on, these are some of my polar bear buddies. 

GUY

They can't stay. 

GUY

We're having a party here? 

JERRY

No, we're having an intervention 

GUY

An intervention? Who's intervening? 

JERRY

There's a friend of ours on drugs and we're going to confront him. 

GUY

Sure, we used to do that when one of our polar bears stopped coming. We would go to his house and say, 'What you don't want to be a polar bear anymore? It's too cold for you?' 

GUY

It's him. 

ROBERTA

What should we do? 

ELAINE

Hide! 

JERRY

It's NOT a surprise party! Yeah (to intercom) 

GEORGE

It's George 

JERRY

Yeah, come on up. ... It's not him. 

GUY

If you don't go out with me it's because I'm a bar tender. 

ELAINE

Look, I don't think this is appropriate right now. 

GUY

Is it because I have a tissue in my nose? 

ELAINE

You're getting warm. 

GEORGE

We just came from Chadway's(?) What's going on. 

JERRY

We're having the intervention for Richie. 

GEORGE

Oh, right, right, the intervention. Should we leave? 

JERRY

Well, uh.. 

NOEL

(happily) Elaine, hi. 

ELAINE

Oh, hi Noel 

JERRY

Well, you're looking well. 

GEORGE

Jerry, let me tell you something, 'A man without hand is not a man.' I got so much hand I'm coming out of my gloves. I got to thank Kramer. 

STEVE

Even if I were dragged through manure I still wouldn't put that stuff on. 

GEORGE

(to Kramer) This man is a genius. Genius! 

STEVE

You think so? 

GEORGE

I don't think so I know so, Kramer, come here I got to talk to you 

MAN

The male kangaroo doesn't have a pouch only the female has it. The male has pouch envy. 

ELAINE

(Chuckles) 

ELAINE

(laughs) 

NOEL

That laugh. That's the laugh. That's it. You're the one. 

ELAINE

No, no. It was an accident. It really wasn't my fault. It was Jerry. 

NOEL

You put a Pez dispenser on her leg during my recital?. 

JERRY

I didn't know she would laugh. 

NOEL

You lied to me George, you lied to me. 

GEORGE

No, I, uh, um, wa, wa, What did I do? ... Where are you going? 

NOEL

I ... am breaking up ... with you! 

GEORGE

You can't break up with me. I've got hand. 

NOEL

And you're going to need it. 

JERRY

Hey Richie 

RICHIE

So what's going on? 

JERRY

It was pretty ugly from the get go. he's not listening, He's hostile, he's talking back. 

GEORGE

I can't do these puzzles. 

JERRY

So he starts to get up He spots the Pez dispenser on the coffee table 

GEORGE

Ah ah Pez dispenser. 

JERRY

He picks it up - he stares at it - It's like he's hypnotized by it. Then he's telling us this story about how when he was a kid he was in the car with his father, and his father was trying to load one of them 

GEORGE

Well they're hard to load. 

JERRY

Tell me something I don't know. So as the father's trying to load it he loses control of the car and it crashes into a high school cafeteria. Nobody's hurt but Pez is all over the car. And the dispenser was destroyed virtually beyond recognition. 

GEORGE

Poor kid. 

JERRY

So as he's telling the story he starts crying. 

GEORGE

What did you do? 

JERRY

What do you think? I gave him my Pez dispenser. 

GEORGE

Wow 

JERRY

Two hours later he checks into Smither's clinic. I talked to the doctor yesterday. He's doing great on the rehab. He's hooked on Pez. He's eating them like there's no tomorrow. 

GEORGE

What's a three letter word for candy? 

JERRY

I can't do those things. 

JERRY

Let me ask you a question. If you named a kid Rasputin do you think that would have a negative effect on his life? 

ELAINE

Na. 

JERRY

What are you doing? We're going out for dinner in ten minutes. 

ELAINE

Do you realize this is the last meal I am going to have for three days? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

GEORGE

It's George. 

JERRY

Come on up. . . . I never heard of this. You've got to fast for three days to take an ulcer test. How you gonna do that? 

ELAINE

I don't know. How could I possibly have ulcers? Who could have given me ulcers? 

JERRY

I think I'll take out the garbage. 

ELAINE

Hey, have you ever fasted? 

JERRY

Well, once I didn't have dinner until, like 9:00 o'clock, that was pretty rough. (exits to hall with garbage ' meets George) Hey, do me a favour will ya'? Throw out my garbage for me. 

GEORGE

Yeah, right. 

JERRY

Come on, it's just down the hall. 

GEORGE

Give me two bucks. I'll do it for two bucks. 

JERRY

I'll give you 50 cents. 

GEORGE

There's no way I touch that bag for less than two dollars. 

JERRY

Come on. Fifty cents. (??) a piece of Drake's coffee cake 

GEORGE

You're not getting no Drake's Coffee Cake for fifty cents. Yae, Hey, I'm all set. I got the ticket. I'm going to the Cayman Islands this Friday. 

JERRY

I don't get you. Who goes on vacation without a job? What do you need a break from getting up at eleven? 

GEORGE

It's an incredible deal. I don't know why you don't come with me. 

JERRY

Nah, I don't go for these non-refundable deals. I can't commit to a woman. I'm not going to commit to an airline. 

GINA

Hi. 

JERRY

Hi. 

GINA

How are you? 

JERRY

Gina, do you know what a Drake's Coffee Cake is? 

GINA

Of course, the plane cake with the sweet brown crumbs on the top. 

JERRY

How much do they cost? 

GINA

The junior? 

GEORGE

No, no the full size. 

JERRY

No, no the junior. 

GEORGE

You didn't say 'junior'. 

GINA

I haven't had one of those since I was a little girl. 

JERRY

Really? You should be ashamed of yourself. I want you out of here! (MARTIN enters the hall) How ya' doing? 

MARTIN

Good enough. 

JERRY

Boy she's sexy isn't she? 

JERRY

Do you believe that guy? 

ELAINE

What guy? 

JERRY

My neighbour: 

ELAINE

Oh, that creepy guy? 

JERRY

Yeah, did he think I was flirting with her? 

GEORGE

He didn't seem too pleased. 

ELAINE

Maybe I'll get a steak with french fried onion wings. 

GEORGE

hey, you know what? I just remembered something. I had a dream about that guy last night. This is amazing. 

JERRY

What's so amazing? You've seen him before. 

GEORGE

I haven't seen him for months. 

JERRY

What was the dream? 

GEORGE

I was doing standup comedy in Kennebunkport Maine. ??? night club. The stage was on a cliff and the audience was throwing all the comics off. 

JERRY

I think I've played there. 

GEORGE

I've had a lot of other paranormal stuff happen to me. 

JERRY

You're a little paranormal 

ELAINE

Hey, George, you know my friend goes to a psychic. 

GEORGE

Really? 

ELAINE

Uh uh, you should go some time. 

GEORGE

I'd love to go. Make an appointment. 

JERRY

Psychics, vacations. How about getting a job? 

GEORGE

I just got fired. 

JERRY

Alright, come on, lets get out of here. 

ELAINE

I wonder what Ghandi ate before his fast. 

JERRY

I heard he used to polish off a box of Triscuits. 

ELAINE

Really? 

JERRY

Oh, yeah. Ghandi loved Triscuits. 

JERRY

Who is it? Who is it? 

GINA

It's Gina. 

JERRY

Who? 

GINA

Martine's girl friend. 

JERRY

Martine? 

GINA

You next door neighbour. 

JERRY

Oh, Martin! 

GEORGE

It's Martine. I think he's dying. He tried to kill himself with pills. 

JERRY

What? 

GINA

Come on. 

JERRY

In my pajamas? I better get my robe. 

GINA

We don't have enough time. 

JERRY

It'll take two seconds. 

GINA

There is no time. 

JERRY

We don't have two seconds? 

GINA

All right. Go ahead. 

JERRY

Nah, forget it. 

GINA

No, go ahead. 

JERRY

Nah. I'll just wear the pajamas. 

GINA

Will you just get it. 

JERRY

Are you sure? 

GINA

Forget it. Come on. 

JERRY

Nah, I'll go get the robe. 

JERRY

That's not too bad. It's not like a Sunny von Bulow comma. The doctor said he should snap out of it anytime. 

GINA

You know why he did this? Because I told him it was over. I did not want to see him anymore. 

JERRY

Really? It's over? 

GINA

I could not stand it another minute. Yesterday he turned over a man's hot dog stand because he thought the man was looking at me. And then after he saw you in the hall. Ach, he was crazy with jealousy. 

JERRY

Oh boy, did he say anything about me? 

GINA

He does not like you. And all indications are he does not like Drake's Coffee Cake. 

JERRY

He said that? 

GINA

He was screaming about it all night. How it's too sweet and it falls apart when you eat it. 

JERRY

I'm sorry if I caused any trouble. I was just being friendly. 

GINA

I wasn't. 

JERRY

You weren't? 

GINA

No, I have thought about you many times. Have you thought about me? 

JERRY

Of course. 

GINA

Tell me everything. 

JERRY

Are you sure he can't hear anything? . . .MARTIN, MARTIN. 

GINA

I wish he was not in a coma. I wish he was dead. I wish I could pull the plug out from him. 

JERRY

I, would, I would wait on that. I know how you feel but. Juries today, you never know how they're going to look at a thing like this. 

GINA

I saw you looking at your watch. You want to leave? Go ahead. 

JERRY

No, I just wanted to see what time it was. 

GINA

Are you afraid of him? 

JERRY

No. 

GINA

Then kiss me. 

JERRY

Here? 

GINA

Yes, right here. 

JERRY

Is this the proper venue? 

GINA

You don't want to? 

JERRY

No, no, I want to. I, I very much want to. I, I desire to. I, I pine to. 

GINA

Then kiss me right in front of him. 

JERRY

I can't. What if he wakes up? 

GINA

A man is lying here unconscious and you're afraid of him? What kind of a man are you? 

JERRY

A man who respects a good comma. If it was one of those in and out comas, maybe. But when a guy's got a coma going like this ... you don't want to mess with it. 

KRAMER

Hey. 

JERRY

Hey. 

KRAMER

Did you hear about Martin? 

JERRY

Yeah, I heard. 

KRAMER

I can't believe he's in a coma. 

KRAMER

He's got my vacuum cleaner. You know I loaned it to him. He never returned it. The carpets are filthy. What am I going to do? 

JERRY

Who told you about Martin? 

KRAMER

Newman! He's good friends with him. 

JERR

Oh, big mouth Newman. I should have guessed. 

KRAMER

He's got all of my attachments, you know. 

JERRY

Hey, let me ask you something. How long do you have to wait for a guy to come out of a coma before you can ask his ex-girlfriend out? 

KRAMER

What, Gina? Why wait? Why not just call Doctor Kavorkian? 

JERRY

You know I don't get that whole suicide machine. There's no tall buildings where these people live? They can't wrap their lips around a revolver like a normal person? 

KRAMER

So what's going on between you and Gina? 

JERRY

Well, I went with her to the hospital last night. 

KRAMER

Uh, uh. 

JERRY

So we're in the room and she's trying to get me to kiss her right in front of him. 

KRAMER

Uh, uh, you see that's the great thing about Mediterranean women. All right, so what did you do? 

JERRY

Nothing. 

KRAMER

Ah, what kind of a man are you? The guy is unconscious in a coma and you don't have the guts to kiss his girlfriend? 

JERRY

I didn't know what the coma etiquette was. 

KRAMER

There is no coma etiquette. You see that's the beauty of the coma, man. It doesn't matter what you do around it. 

JERRY

So you're saying, his girl, his car, his clothes, it's all up for grabs. You can just loot the coma victim. 

KRAMER

I'd give him 24 hours to get out of it. They can't get out of it in 24 hours, it's a land rush. 

JERRY

So if the coma victim wakes up in a month, he's thrilled, he got out of the coma. He goes home, there's nothing left? 

KRAMER

NOTHING LEFT! That's why I'm trying to get that vacuum cleaner. Because somebody's going to grab it. 

RULA

Martin's spirit came to you as a warning. 

ELAINE

Why would he come to George? 

RULA

Because George has heightened extra sensory perception. FAYGY GET YOUR FINGER OUT OF YOUR NOSE. 

GEORGE

I knew it. I always felt different. 

RULA

You are. Some coffee cake? 

GEORGE

Drakes? 

RULA

Yes. 

GEORGE

Did you buy this for me? 

RULA

No, why? 

GEORGE

Ha, because I love Drake's Coffee Cake. 

RULA

Maybe I did. 

ELAINE

Take it away. 

GEORGE

She hasn't eaten in two days. 

RULA

Who's Pauline? 

GEORGE

Pauline? . . . Wait a minute. I got it. My brother once impregnated a woman named Pauline. 

RULA

Do you think about her? 

GEORGE

When I hear her name mentioned. 

RULA

Cut these with your left hand. 

GEORGE

There was a woman, Audrey. She had a very big nose. 

RULA

I see an Audrey, but with a small nose. 

GEORGE

Yes, yes, she had a nose job. I loved her very deeply. Will she ever speak to me again? 

RULA

Not in this life. 

ELAINE

Should you be smoking? 

RULA

Does it bother you? 

ELAINE

You're pregnant. 

GEORGE

Elaine. 

RULA

I smoked when I had Faisy. 

RULA

Ah oh. 

GEORGE

Ah oh? What? What Ah oh? 

RULA

I don't know about this trip George. 

GEORGE

You can see the Cayman Islands in there? Is something going to happen to me? What? 

ELAINE

It's really bad for the fetus. Do you know that. 

GEORGE

Elaine, she's a psychic. She knows how the kid's going to be. 

GEORGE

Should I not go on this trip? 

RULA

George, I am going to tell you something and I want you to really hear me. 

ELAINE

Now listen. I just don't know how a person, with everything we now know about pre-natal care can put a cigarette in her mouth. 

GEORGE

Elaine, what are you doing? 

ELAINE

It's disgusting. 

RULA

I DON'T BELIVE IT. I would like you both to leave. 

ELAINE

Oh fine, I don't like to be around people who are just so irresponsible. 

RULA

Get the hell out. 

GEORGE

A plane crash? A Heart attack? Lupus? Is it Lupus? 

RULA

Do you want me to call the super? He was an Israeli commando. 

GEORGE

If you don't say anything I will assume it's a plane crash. 

RULA

Get out. 

GEORGE

Not a plane crash. (leaving) Is it a plane crash? 

GINA

I do not like your toothbrush. There are no bristles. 

JERRY

You can say what you want about me but I'll be damned if I'm going to stand here while you insult my toothbrush. 

GINA

It is too small for someone with such a big mouth (kisses Kerry). Let me ask you. What will you do if Martine wakes up? Run away like a mouse? 

JERRY

No, more like the Three Stooges at the end of every movie. 

GINA

Who are these Stooges you speak of? 

JERRY

They're a comedy team. 

GINA

Tell me about them. Everything. 

JERRY

Well, they're three kind of funny looking guys and they hit each other a lot. 

GINA

You will show me The Stooges? 

JERRY

I will show you The Stooges. 

GINA

When? 

JERRY

Well, I don't really know where The Stooges are right now but if I locate them you will be the first to know. 

GINA

Come, you walk me to a cab. 

JERRY

Well, uh, I uh, I don't want you to get upset or anything but uh, with Martin and all, well maybe it's not such a good idea for us to be seen together in the building, because, you know, he had a lot of friends here. 

GINA

You're still afraid. You are not a man. 

JERRY

Well then what are all those ties and sport jackets doing in my closet? 

GINA

Are you going to walk me to a cab or not? 

JERRY

Yeah, all right. All right. 

KRAMER

You should just eat fruit. 

NEWMAN

I can't eat fruit. It makes me incontinent. 

KRAMER

??? 

NEWMAN

Hello Gina. Hello Jerry. 

JERRY

Hello Newman. 

JERRY

Do you think Newman would tell Martin if he wakes up? What kind of sicko would do that? He could kill me. 

GEORGE

People smoke, Elaine. My mother smoked. It didn't hurt me. 

ELAINE

(jumps with fear to Jerry) Did you see that wall move? 

JERRY

Boy, it's a good thing we came. 

GEORGE

Could there be a native p0roblem in the Caymans? Maybe there's native unrest. 

ELAINE

Hi, I haven't eaten in three days. I was wondering how much longer it would be until I get my X-ray. 

NURSE

We'll call you. 

JERRY

George, I want you to promise me something. If I'm ever in a comma. In the first 24 hours get everything out of my apartment and put it in storage. 

GEORGE

How come? 

JERRY

Looters. 

ELAINE

How do we know that dog food is any good? Who tastes it? 

JERRY

She's really hungry. 

KRAMER

Hey. 

ELAINE

Kramer 

KRAMER

Well, Newman's upstairs visiting Martin. 

GEORGE

Would you buy my Cayman Island ticket? 

KRAMER

You're not going? 

GEORGE

No. 

KRAMER

Why not? 

GEORGE

The psychic said something terrible will happen. 

KRAMER

I dig. 

KRAMER

I want my vacuum cleaner! I know you can hear me. Look my mother, she's going to come and visit me. She sees that rug, she's going to kill me. 

NEWMAN

He can't hear you, you idiot. Why don't you just buy another one. 

KRAMER

Why would I buy another one when I spent a hundred bucks on this one? 

NEWMAN

I have a carpet sweeper you can use. 

KRAMER

I don't want a carpet sweeper. They don't do anything. 

NEWMAN

It gets my rug clean. 

KRAMER

The carpet sweeper is the biggest scam perpetrated on the American public since One Hour Martinizing. 

NEWMAN

Well, you should take a look at my rug then. 

KRAMER

I wouldn't set foot in your house. 

JERRY

Hello. 

NEWMAN

Hello Jerry. 

JERRY

How's he doing? 

KRAMER

He looks happy to me. 

NEWMAN

I hope he stays this happy when he wakes up. 

JERRY

Why wouldn't he? 

NEWMAN

No reason. 

JERRY

He'll have a lot of catching up to do, I guess. 

NEWMAN

I'll bring him up to date. 

JERRY

How up to date? 

NEWMAN

Oh, all the way up. 

JERRY

And nothing could change your mind? 

NEWMAN

Well, it would take a hell of a lot. Because a friend is something you earn. 

KRAMER

Okay, Jerry has a friend who has free tickets to the Cayman Islands for this weekend. He's not going. 

NEWMAN

I don't care much for the beach. I freckle. . . . Is that a,.. 

JERRY

Drake's Coffee Cake 

NEWMAN

Wow, where did you get that? 

JERRY

From my house. I got a whole box of them. 

NEWMAN

Boy, that's the full size. 

JERRY

That's your big boy. 

NEWMAN

Can I have a bite? 

JERRY

I don't give out bites. I got another one. But I'm saving it for later. 

NEWMAN

Just one bite? 

JERRY

I don't think so. You know they, they're so fragile. 

NEWMAN

All right! All right. I won't say anything. 

JERRY

You swear? 

NEWMAN

I swear. 

JERRY

On your mother's life? 

NEWMAN

On my mother's life. 

KRAMER

oh oh oh oh oh 

NEWMAN

Oooh, 

ELAINE

And there it was, mountains of duck. And not fatty duck either, but juicy tender breasts of duck. 

GEORGE

...sweetheart, no come here, ... sweetheart 

RULA

pew, pew, pew, pew (breathing) 

GEORGE

how did I know you were here? Something drew me here. This is phenomenal. 

RULA

The nurse said she would be right back. They're supposed to take me into the delivery room. 

GEORGE

Oh, that's great. That's great. By the way I have to apologize for my friend the other day. Friend? Uh, uh I don't even know that woman. I met her on the bus on the way over. I couldn't get rid of her. Uh, My psychic instincts were a little off .. 

RULA

Oh, where's the nurse 

GEORGE

I don't know where the nurse is. Sweetheart why don't you get a nurse for mommy? ... Anyway I was just curious. Remember the other day you were saying something about my trip. 

RULA

Don't take that trip. 

GEORGE

Yeah, why? Why? 

RULA

(screams) EEEY, beegit, beegit beegit. 

GEORGE

Because? Because? 

ELAINE

Assassins! How dare they keep a person waiting like this! ... Drake's Coffee Cake? ... Give me that. 

NEWMAN

Jerry, you better stop her or I'll tell. 

JERRY

Elaine! No! No! 

MARTIN

Ooooh, ahhhh, 

GEORGE

Are there terrorists on the plane? A hotel fire. Is that it? Malaria? Yellow fever? Lupus? Is it Lupus? 

NEWMAN

He did it right in this bed, Martin. Right in front of you. 

KRAMER

I want my vacuum cleaner! 

JERRY

Hey! 

NEWMAN

It was disgusting. 

JERRY

What are you doing? We're going out to dinner in ten minutes. 

GEORGE

I never assisted in a birth before. It's really quite disgusting. 

JERRY

What did she name the kid? 

GEORGE

You wouldn't believe it. Rasputin. 

KRAMER

Heey! 

GEORGE

Hey. 

JERRY

Hey. 

GEORGE

when did you get back? 

KRAMER

A couple of hours ago. 

GEORGE

So how was it? 

KRAMER

George, I would like to thank you for the greatest four days I ever spent in my life. 

JERRY

osh. 

KRAMER

They were shooting the Sports Illustrated swim suit issue right in the hotel pool. 

JERRY

Woah. (hitting George) 

KRAMER

Not only that but at the hotel they opened up this area on the beach for nude bathing and all of the Sports Illustrated models went down there. 

JERRY

Wow! (hitting George) 

KRAMER

I was on the next blanket from Elle McPherson 

JERRY

Oh! (hitting George) 

KRAMER

We played Backgammon in the nude. 

JERRY

Oh! (hitting George) 

KRAMER

She's a sweet kid. 

JERRY

Nude backgammon with swimsuit models! 

KRAMER

Oh, you know what? The second day I was there I stepped on a jellyfish. Now it kind of stung my foot. That's probably what Rula was trying to warn you about. 

GEORGE

Yeah, you gotta' watch for the jellyfish. 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

KRAMER

What's this? 

JERRY

Oh, it's an invitation to a house warming from Martin and Gina. 

KRAMER

They moved in together? 

JERRY

Yeah, it's some place down in the village. 

KRAMER

Phew. 

JERRY

Yeah. 

ELAINE

It's Elaine. 

JERRY

All right we're coming down. 

KRAMER

Hey, where ya' going? 

JERRY

We're taking Elaine to dinner. She's got to start the fast again. Um, you want to go? 

KRAMER

Um, I'd like to but a bunch of us from the islands, we'll be getting together. 

GEORGE

Elle McPherson going to be there? 

KRAMER

OH! I got to call her back. 

GEORGE

Why even try anymore? There's no sense to it. I'm never gonna meet anybody, I should just accept it. 

JERRY

Oh, yes you will. 

GEORGE

No, I won't. 

JERRY

Yeah, maybe you won't. 

GEORGE

I mean it's hard enough to meet a woman you dislike, much less like. 

JERRY

Are my nostrils getting bigger? 

GEORGE

No. Why must it be so difficult? Why is there all this tension and hostility? Why can't I just walk up to a woman on the street and say, 'Hi. I'm 

CYNTHIA

There's just no men out there, you know? 

ELAINE

I know. 

CYNTHIA

I mean the problem is that the good ones know they're good. And they know they're in such demand they're just not interested in confining themselves to one person. 

ELAINE

I hate the good ones. 

CYNTHIA

Is Jerry one of the good ones? 

ELAINE

That's a good question, I think he thinks he is. 

CYNTHIA

Well, the mediocre ones are available, but they're so insecure about not being one of the good ones that they're always going, 'Well I'm not good enough for you, what are you doing with me?' and eventually I just go, 'You're right.' 

ELAINE

You know, maybe you need somebody between good and mediocre. 

CYNTHIA

No, maybe I need somebody who has nothing, somebody who just has to appreciate being with me because he's so desperate. 

GEORGE

I mean it's gotten to the point where I'm flirting with operators on the phone. I almost made a date with one. 

JERRY

Oh, so there's still hope. 

GEORGE

I don't want hope. Hope is killing me. My dream is to become hopeless. When you're hopeless, you don't care, and when you don't care, that indifference makes you attractive. 

JERRY

Oh, so hopelessness is the key. 

GEORGE

It's my only hope. 

CYNTHIA

See, I wouldn't really mind so much, but I feel badly for my mother. I mean, if my mother weren't around, it wouldn't be so bad. But, I'm telling you, if I'm not married by the time I'm forty, I'm gonna have to kill her because it's the only fair thing to do. I just couldn't put her through that. 

ELAINE

Well, at least you're not bitter. 

CYNTHIA

Who says I'm not bitter? 

ELAINE

Aren't you too young to be bitter? 

CYNTHIA

No, you can be young and bitter, just maybe not as bitter as I'm gonna be ten years from now, but I'm bitter. Anyway, don't tell anyone. 

ELAINE

Don't worry, your bitterness is safe with me. 

CYNTHIA

Um, order me a piece of cake. I'm gonna go throw up. 

JERRY

Look at my hands. Look. Filthy from the paper. You know, they should give you a Wet-nap when you buy one, like at those rib joints. 

ELAINE

So what'd you do last night? 

JERRY

Went out with George, you? 

ELAINE

Went out with Cynthia. 

JERRY

How was it? What'd you talk about? 

ELAINE

Well, you know, the usual; The Federal Reserve, the rainforest. Cynthia thought we should nuke the rainforest, you know, get rid of it in one fell swoop so we can at least eliminate it as a subject of conversation. What about you? 

JERRY

We brushed on that. Actually, George was in rare form. He just can't find anybody. 

ELAINE

I know, Cynthia too. She's really given up. 

JERRY

George too. 

ELAINE

Yeah, right. 

JERRY

I've never fixed anybody up. 

ELAINE

Uh, me neither and I am not about to start with George. 

JERRY

Well why wouldn't you start with George? You think she's too good for George? 

ELAINE

I didn't say 'too good', did I say 'too good'? 

JERRY

Well you implied it. 

ELAINE

I didn't say it. 

JERRY

Because if you think she's too good for George, you are dead wrong. Dead wrong. Who is she? 

ELAINE

Who is he? 

JERRY

He's George! 

ELAINE

She's Cynthia! 

JERRY

So what? 

ELAINE

What, you don't think she's beautiful? 

JERRY

I don't know, what's with the eyebrows? 

ELAINE

You know what your problem is? Your standards are too high. 

JERRY

I went out with you. 

ELAINE

That's because my standards are too low. And by the way, you know, women kill for eyebrows like that. Do you know that? I mean women pluck their real eyebrows out of their head, one by one, until they're bald, Jerry. Bald above the eyes! And then they paint in these eyebrows to look like that. 

JERRY

Well let me tell you something about George. He is fast. He can run like the wind. And he's strong. I've seen him lift a hundred pounds over his head without even knowing it. And you wouldn't know it to look at him, but George can bait a hook. 

ELAINE

He can really do that? 

JERRY

Come on, let's do it, I think they'll really get along. 

ELAINE

What, are you into this? 

JERRY

Yeah, come on, it's a good match. 

ELAINE

No, wait a minute, wait a minute. They're gonna be telling us how their dates went. Are we gonna share that information? 

JERRY

Naturally. 

ELAINE

Well, wait a minute, we're gonna tell each other everything, I mean every secret? 

JERRY

Everything. 

ELAINE

What if it worked out? 

JERRY

Yeah right. 

GEORGE

Out of the question. Out of the question! 

JERRY

Why? 

GEORGE

No! I'm not gonna do that! That's one step away from personal ads! And prostitutes! No! No, I am not going down that road! What does she look like? 

JERRY

She's good looking. 

GEORGE

How good looking? 

JERRY

Very good looking. 

GEORGE

Really good looking? 

JERRY

Really very good looking. 

GEORGE

Would you take her out? 

JERRY

Yes, I would take her out. 

GEORGE

Oh, you hesitated. 

JERRY

What hesitate? I didn't hesitate! 

GEORGE

No, something's off here, you hesitated. 

JERRY

I'm telling you, she's good looking. 

GEORGE

What about the body, what kind of body? 

JERRY

Good body, nice body. 

GEORGE

How nice? 

JERRY

Nice. 

GEORGE

Just nice? 

JERRY

Pretty nice. 

GEORGE

Really good? 

JERRY

Really very nice and good. 

GEORGE

What about personality? 

JERRY

Good personality. Funny. Bright. 

GEORGE

Smarter than me? I don't want anyone smarter than me. 

JERRY

How could she be smarter than you? 

GEORGE

Alright, let's see, let's see. What else. What else. Oh yeah, what does she do? 

CYNTHIA

First of all, what does he do? 

ELAINE

He was in real estate, um, now, he's not working right now- 

CYNTHIA

He's not working?! How come he's not working? 

ELAINE

Well, um, he, he got fired. 

CYNTHIA

Why did he get fired? 

ELAINE

Uh. Why? Oh, right. Um, well, he tried to poison his boss. 

CYNTHIA

Excuse me? 

ELAINE

Such a long story, Cynthia, seriously, I mean he just had some problems at work. 

CYNTHIA

Is he nuts? 

ELAINE

No, no, no, he's a really really funny guy. 

CYNTHIA

What does he look like? 

ELAINE

Pardon? 

CYNTHIA

What does he look like? 

ELAINE

Um, well, he's got a lot of character in his face. Um, he's short. Um, he's stocky. 

CYNTHIA

Fat. Is that what you're saying, that he's fat? 

ELAINE

Powerful. He is so powerful, he can lift a hundred pounds right up over his head. And um, what else. What else. Oh, right. Um, well, he's kind of, just kind of losing his hair. 

CYNTHIA

He's bald? 

ELAINE

No! No, no, no, he's not bald. He's balding. 

CYNTHIA

So he will be bald. 

ELAINE

Yup. 

GEORGE

What kind of hair? 

JERRY

You know, long dark hair. 

GEORGE

Flowing? 

JERRY

Flowing? 

GEORGE

Is it flowing? I like flowing, cascading hair. Thick lustrous hair is very important to me. 

JERRY

'Thick lustrous hair is very important to me,' is that what you said? 

GEORGE

Yeah, that's right. 

JERRY

Just clarifying. 

GEORGE

Let me ask you this. If you stick your hand in the hair is it easy to get it out? 

JERRY

Do you want to be able to get it out or do you want to not be able to get it out? 

GEORGE

I'd like to be able to get it out. 

JERRY

I think you'll get it out. 

GEORGE

What about the skin? I need a good cheek, I like a good cheek. 

JERRY

She's got a fine cheek. 

GEORGE

Is there a pinkish hue? 

JERRY

A pinkish hue? 

GEORGE

Yes, a rosy glow. 

JERRY

There's a hue. She's got great eyebrows, women kill to have her eyebrows. 

GEORGE

Who cares about eyebrows? Is she sweet? I like sweet. But not too sweet, you could throw up from that. 

JERRY

I don't think you'll throw up. *She* likes to throw up. 

CYNTHIA

Has he ever been married? 

ELAINE

No. 

CYNTHIA

Has he been close? 

ELAINE

He once spent a weekend with a woman. 

CYNTHIA

He didn't really try to poison his boss? 

ELAINE

Yeah, he did. 

GEORGE

We had an incredible phone conversation. We talked for like twenty minutes. I threw away my notes in the middle of the call. You know, I thought she had a great voice timbre. Is it timbre or tamber? 

JERRY

I think it's tamber. 

GEORGE

Why'd I think it was timbre? Yeah, she could do voiceover commercials, why didn't you tell me about her voice? 

JERRY

I didn't notice the voice. 

GEORGE

It's mellifluous! 

JERRY

So, Saturday night. 

GEORGE

She had to be impressed by that conversation, had to! It was a great performance. I am unbelievable on the phone. On the date they should just have two phones on the table at the restaurant, done. 

ELAINE

Hi. 

GEORGE

Hey! Saturday night! 

ELAINE

I know! 

GEORGE

So, what did she say? 

ELAINE

She said you're getting together Saturday night! 

GEORGE

That's it? 

ELAINE

Yeah! 

GEORGE

She didn't mention anything about the conversation? 

ELAINE

No. 

GEORGE

Now, you see, I don't get that. We had a relaxed stimulating, great conversation, she doesn't mention it? Why doesn't she mention it? 

ELAINE

What? 

JERRY

She could have mentioned the conversation. 

GEORGE

Alright, alright, I'll go on the date, but that's that. 

KRAMER

Hey. 

JERRY

Hey. 

KRAMER

You know my friend, Bob Sacamano? 

JERRY

Oh, the guy from Jersey? 

KRAMER

Yeah. He just got a job at a condom factory in Edison. Look at this, he gave me a gross. 

GEORGE

What are you gonna do with all of them? 

KRAMER

Oh, well... Come on, take some, Jerry. Grab 'em. 

JERRY

No thanks, they look like they came out of a cereal box. 

KRAMER

Come on, Elaine, here, take half a bag. 

ELAINE

Half a bag? What am I, a hooker? Anyway, they look kind of cheap. 

GEORGE

I'll take one. It's possible. 

JERRY

So where are they already, it's a quarter to twelve, they should be back by now, what did they do? 

ELAINE

I think they went out to dinner. 

JERRY

Wait, I got another call. That must be him. [clicks over] Hello? 

GEORGE

Yeah, it's me, I just got home. 

JERRY

Oh, hold on. [clicks back] It's George, he just got home. 

ELAINE

Yeah, yeah, I got Cynthia on the other line. 

JERRY

Alright, I'll call you back as soon as I'm done. 

ELAINE

Remember our pact. Full disclosure. 

JERRY

Of course. [clicks back to George] Yeah, go ahead. 

GEORGE

Alright look, I'm gonna tell you, but I made a pact with Cynthia, we swore we were not going to tell you and Elaine. 

JERRY

You can tell me, I'll vault it. 

GEORGE

It's in the vault? 

JERRY

I'm locking the vault. What? 

GEORGE

We had sex. 

JERRY

Oh my god, you had sex, how did that happen? 

GEORGE

I don't know. I closed my eyes and made a move. 

JERRY

At your apartment? 

GEORGE

Yeah. 

JERRY

She didn't stay over? 

GEORGE

No, she left. Listen, you can't mention any of this to Elaine. Cynthia will kill me, we made a deal. 

ELAINE

Oh my god. 

CYNTHIA

He was uncomfortable because it was our first time so he felt he would perform better if we did it in the kitchen. He said the kitchen is always the most sociable room in the house. And he was serious. 

ELAINE

So? How was it? 

CYNTHIA

How good could it be? My head was on a hot plate. 

ELAINE

Wait, I got another call, that must be Jerry. 

CYNTHIA

Oh wait, don't you tell him any of this. 

ELAINE

Yeah, ok. [clicks over] Hello? 

JERRY

So, what did she have to say? 

ELAINE

What did he have to say? 

JERRY

He said they had a good time. 

ELAINE

Her too. 

JERRY

Oh, good. 

ELAINE

Anything else? 

JERRY

Nope. You? 

ELAINE

Nope. 

JERRY

You sure? 

ELAINE

Yup. You? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

ELAINE

Alright. Well uh, guess everything is under control. 

JERRY

Yeah. Okay then. 

ELAINE

Alright. Goodnight. 

JERRY

Goodnight. 

GEORGE

I left three messages. I can't believe this woman. She has sex with me, leaves ten minutes later then I never hear from her again. What kind of a person does this? I mean, she used me. I feel cheap and violated. 

JERRY

Well, I'm gonna do something about this. 

GEORGE

What are you gonna do? 

JERRY

Nevermind. Disgraceful. Leaves you sitting there on the kitchen floor like some kind of roach trap. Wham, bam, thank you ma'am. Sir, whatever. She's not going to get away with this. 

GEORGE

I keep wracking my brain to try and figure out what I did. I was smart, I was funny, I made great small talk with the waitress so she could see I could relate to the commoners, you know, I'm a man of the people. 

JERRY

I'm gonna call her. 

GEORGE

No, don't call her. 

JERRY

No, I'm calling her. 

GEORGE

No, Jerry, don't call. 

JERRY

No, forget it, I'm gonna call. 

GEORGE

I don't want you to call. 

JERRY

Get away from me, I'm gonna call her. 

GEORGE

Give me the phone! 

JERRY

George, do you wanna fight? Do you wanna fight? 

GEORGE

Jerry, I'm gonna kill you! 

KRAMER

Hey hey hey!! Come on! Jerry, George, now stop it! 

JERRY

I'll just call her when you leave! 

GEORGE

You can't do that, it's none of your business! 

JERRY

It is so my business! 

KRAMER

Hey hey hey! I don't want to hear another word out of either one of you! 

GEORGE

But tell him to give me the-- 

KRAMER

Ay ay ay! The next one of you that opens up your mouth, says something, you're gonna have to deal with me. You know, I bet I know what this is about. It's about a woman, isn't it? 

GEORGE

No. 

JERRY

Yeah, but-- 

KRAMER

Yeah yeah! You see, this is exactly what they want to do to you. They play one against the other. You can't let them manipulate you like that. 

JERRY

But Kramer-- 

KRAMER

Noh noh noh! I want you guys to shake hands. Come on, there are plenty of women out there for all of us, let's go. 

KRAMER

Yes. You see? Isn't that better than fighting? Animosity? I mean, you wanna fight with somebody, you fight with me. Oh, by the way George, you know those condoms I gave you? They're defective, don't use them. 

GEORGE

What? 

KRAMER

Right. 

GEORGE

Defective?! 

KRAMER

Defective. 

GEORGE

(attacking Kramer) How could you give me a defective condom?! 

KRAMER

I didn't even know they were defective. 

KRAMER

Didn't even thin you were gonna use them. 

GEORGE

What do you mean you didn't think I wasn't gonna use them?! 

JERRY

Take it easy, you guys, just spread out! Don't worry about it, if anything was wrong she would have called you already! 

CYNTHIA

I missed my period. 

ELAINE

Oh my god. 

CYNTHIA

I am very worried, I am never late. 

ELAINE

But he used a condom, right? 

CYNTHIA

I know, but these things aren't always foolproof. 

ELAINE

Oh no. 

CYNTHIA

What? 

ELAINE

Was it blue? 

CYNTHIA

Yeah. How'd you know? 

ELAINE

Just a hunch. 

JERRY

Ow! Ow! Twist off! Twist off! Twist off! 

JERRY

Oh, hi. Soda? 

ELAINE

No thanks. 

JERRY

So tell me. What's the problem with your little flaky friend? She doesn't return calls? 

ELAINE

Who are you to talk about her like that? She'll call him when she's good and ready. You don't even know her. 

JERRY

Oh, I know her. I know her type. 

ELAINE

Her type? What type? 

JERRY

The type that doesn't return phone calls. I knew we shouldn't have done this, it was a bad idea in the first place, I told you! 

ELAINE

You told me? You pushed this whole thing on me, it was your idea! 

JERRY

I was just trying to help your bitter, twisted friend. 

ELAINE

She's not bitter! 

JERRY

Well, bitter's a judgement call, but she's twisted! 

ELAINE

Twisted? God, I did you a favor. 

JERRY

I thought you said they had a good time, is there anything else you're keeping from me? 

ELAINE

Are you calling me a liar? 

JERRY

I'm calling you one if you are one, are you a liar? 

ELAINE

Are you? 

JERRY

Get your finger out of my face. 

ELAINE

You get yours out, I was here first! 

JERRY

I don't care. 

ELAINE

Get it out! 

KRAMER

Hey hey, alright, hey hey, stop it! Come on, break it up! What's the matter with you? Now don't you two see that you're in love with each other? I mean, why can't you face that already? You're running around out there looking for something that's not even there, when everything that you dream of is right here, right here in front of you. Now why can't you admit that? By the way, when you see George give him these, these'll work. 

ELAINE

I knew those condoms were defective! 

JERRY

How did you know they were defective?! 

ELAINE

Because! Because she missed her period! 

GEORGE

She missed her period? Oh my god. I can't believe it! I'm a father! I did it! My boys can swim! I can do it! I can do it! 

CYNTHIA

So he shows up. He's all out of breath. He's disheveled. And he tells me that no matter what happens, whatever I decide is fine with him and that I could depend on him, and that he would be there to support me in whatever way I need. Elaine, I was speechless. 

ELAINE

Wow. Wow. You see? You think you know somebody. 

CYNTHIA

I said to him, 'I really appreciate this, but I just got my period.' And so, I asked him to come in, he came in-- 

ELAINE

Hi! 

GEORGE

Sorry, we're a little late. We got so hung up in traffic. 

ELAINE

What happened? 

JERRY

Acting. 

ELAINE

Very mature. 

JERRY

Thank you. Hi Cynthia. 

CYNTHIA

Hi. 

JERRY

Well this is a great place to sit you got here. 

CYNTHIA

Best seat in the house. (Looking at George) right next to the kitchen. 

GEORGE

(hitting Cynthia playfully with a napkin) Stop it, stop it. 

JERRY

So what are these? 

ELAINE

Oh, we ordered some appetizers. Start eating. 

GEORGE

(with a mouth full of food) This is good. Oh, this is good. 

KRAMER

Wide open, I was wide open underneath! I had three inches on that guy. You two were hogging the ball. 

GEORGE

Me? It wasn't me I never even saw the ball. All you do is dribble. 

JERRY

I have to dribble, if I give it to you, you just shoot. You're a chucker. 

GEORGE

Oh I'm a chucker. 

JERRY

That's right, everytime you get the ball you shoot. 

GEORGE

I can't believe you called me a chucker. No way I'm a chucker, I do not chuck, never chucked, never have chucked, never will chuck, no chuck! 

JERRY

You chuck. 

GEROGE

Kramer am I a chucker? 

KRAMER

You're a chucker. 

GEORGE

All these years I've been chuckin' and you've never told me? 

JERRY

Well it's not an easy thing to bring up. 

KRAMER

Hey you know this is the first time we've ever seen each other naked. 

JERRY

Believe me I didn't see anything. 

KRAMER

Oh, you didn't sneak a peak? 

JERRY

No, did you? 

KRAMER

Yeah, I snuck a peak. 

JERRY

Why? 

KRAMER

Why not? hey what about you George? 

GEORGE

yeah, I ... I snuck a peak. ... But it was so fast I didn't see anything. It was just a blur. 

JERRY

I made a conscious effort not to look. There's certain information I just don't want to have. 

KRAMER

Uh, I gotta go meet Newman. All right. I'll see you later. 

JERRY

All right 

KRAMER

Have a good one. 

JERRY

All right 

GEORGE

See ya. 

GEORGE

look at this guy. Does he have to stretch in here? 

JERRY

You know who that is? That's 

GEORGE

Keith Hernandez? The baseball player? 

JERRY

Yeah, that's him. 

GEORGE

Are you sure? 

JERRY

Positive. 

GEORGE

Wow, Keith Hernandez. He's such a great player. 

JERRY

Yeah, he's a real smart guy too. He's a Civil War buff. 

GEORGE

I'd love to be a Civil War buff. ... What do you have to do to be a buff 

JERRY

So Biff wants to be a buff? ... Well sleeping less than 18 hours a day would be a start. 

GEORGE

ho ho ho ho. You know I only got two weeks left of unemployment. I got to prove I've been looking for a job to get an extension 

JERRY

Hey, should we say something to him? 

GEORGE

Oh, yeah I'm sure he loves to hear from fans in the locker room. 

JERRY

well he could say hello to me. I wouldn't mind. 

GEORGE

He's Keith Hernandez. You're Jerry Seinfeld. 

JERRY

So? 

GEORGE

What are you comparing yourself to Keith Hernandez. The guys a baseball player Jerry, Baseball! 

JERRY

I know what he is. I recognized him. You didn't even notice him. 

GEORGE

What, ... you are making some wisecracks in a night club... wo wo wo. The guy was in game SIX two runs down two outs facing elimination. 

KEITH

Excuse me. I don't want to disturb you, I'm Keith Hernandez and I just want to tell you what a big fan I am. I love your comedy. 

JERRY

Really? 

KEITH

I've always wanted to do what you do. 

JERRY

What I do? You are one of my favorite ball players of all time 

GEORGE

Mine too. 

KEITH

I love that bit about Jimmy Olson 

JERRY

Thank you. 

GEORGE

You know Keith, what I've always wondered, with all these ball clubs flying around all season don't you think there would be a plane crash? ... 

KEITH

(to Jerry) Do you perform anywhere in new York right now? 

JERRY

I'm performing in this club on the east Side. You should come in. 

GEORGE

But if you think about it...26 teams, 162 games a season, you'd think eventually an entire team would get wiped out. 

KEITH

You know, I live on the East Side. 

JERRY

I'll tell you what, I'll give you my number and uh, just give me a call, tell me whenever you want to go. 

KEITH

or maybe just to get together for a cup of coffee 

JERRY

Oh. that would be great. 

GEORGE

Uh, it's only a matter of time. 

KEITH

Who's this chucker? 

JERRY

It's been three days and he hasn't called. 

ELAINE

Well maybe you should call him. 

JERRY

I can't ... I can't 

ELAINE

Why not? 

JERRY

I don't know. I just feel he should call me. 

ELAINE

What's the difference? 

JERRY

You don't understand, Elaine. I don't want to be overanxious. If he wants to see me he has my number, he should call. 

ELAINE

Yech, look at this ashtray. I hate cigarettes. 

JERRY

I can't stand these guys. You give your number to them and then they don't call. Why do they do that? 

ELAINE

I'm sorry honey. 

JERRY

I mean, I thought he liked me. I really thought he liked me. we were getting along. He came over to me I didn't go over to him. 

ELAINE

No, 

JERRY

Why did he come over to me if he didn't want to see me? 

ELAINE

I know. 

JERRY

What did he come over to me if he didn't want to see me? I mean here I meet this guy this great guy, a baseball player, best guy I ever met in my life. .. Well that's it. I'm never giving my number out to another guy again. 

ELAINE

Sometimes I've given my number out to guys and it takes them a month to call. 

JERRY

Hu, good, good,... well if he's calling in a month he's got a prayer! 

ELAINE

You know maybe he's been busy. Maybe he's been out of town? 

JERRY

Oh, they don't have phones out of town? Why do(?) people say they're too busy. Too busy. Pick up a phone!! It takes two minutes. How can you be too busy? 

ELAINE

Why don't you just go ahead and call him? 

JERRY

I can't call here, it's a coffee shop. I mean what am I going to say to him? 

ELAINE

Just ask him if he wants a to get together. 

JERRY

For what dinner? 

ELAINE

Dinner's good.

SOKOL

You know you only have two more weeks before your benefits run out. 

GEORGE

Yes and I was hoping ... to get a thirteen week extension. 

SOKOL

So where have you been looking for work? 

GEORGE

Well you know what I've discovered Mrs. Sokol. It's not so much the looking as the listening. I listen for work. And as I'm looking and listening I am also looking. You can't discount looking. It's sort of a combination. It's looking, and listening, listening and looking. But you must look. 

SOKOL

Can you be specific about any of these companies? 

GEORGE

Specific, Ah, lets see. I've walked in and out of so many buildings they all .. blend in together, I uh, ..

JERRY

(imitates) Ya' gotta see the babi - When are ya' gonna see the babi... Can't they just send us a tape? 

ELAINE

You know if you waited a few more months it won't be a baby anymore then you wouldn't have to see it. 

JERRY

ELAINE

yeah ha ha ha 

JERRY

Hey Kramer what do you think of this shirt? 

KRAMER

(does a double take) It's too busy 

ELAINE

It looks like you're trying too hard to make an impression on him. You're not being yourself. 

KRAMER

What guy? 

JERRY

I know he's just a guy but .. I LIKE him. 

KRAMER

Who are you talkin about? 

JERRY

Uh, Keith uh Hernandez. 

KRAMER

KEITH HERNANDEZ? 

NEWMAN

(enters) KEITH HERNANDEZ? 

GEORGE

Do me a favor would you? Would you change lanes? Would you get outta this lane. You gotta get out of this lane. This lane stinks. They're all double parked here Please get outta this lane. I'm beggin you please please. 

GEORGE

You know what, bad mistake my mistake do me a favor go back to the other lane - you'll never get there - forget this lane - y'a kn ow what this lane stinks - go back to the other lane - bad decision - go go go take this light - take this light -

GEORGE

CABBY

Get out of my cab. 

GEORGE

Wa, I'm not getting out of this cab 

GEORGE

No, no! You can't throw me out 

JERRY

Hellooo Newman. 

KRAMER

I hate KEITH HERNANDEZ - hate him. 

NEWMAN

I despise him. 

ELAINE

Why? 

NEWMAN

Why? I'll tell you why... 

KRAMER

Let me tell it .. 

NEWMAN

No, you can't tell it .. 

KRAMER

You always tell it .. 

NEWMAN

All right, tell it. 

KRAMER

Ja ja ja - just tell it 

NEWMAN

June 14, 1987.... Mets Phillies. We're enjoying a beautiful afternoon in the right field stands when a crucial Hernandez error to a five run Phillies ninth. Cost the Mets the game. 

KRAMER

Our day was ruined. There was a lot of people, you know, they were waiting by the player's parking lot. Now we're coming down the ramp ... [cut to film of the day - like the Zabruter film - with the Umbrella man and everything - Oh so brilliant parody!!!] ... Newman was in front of me. Keith was coming toward us, as he passes Newman turns and says, ' Nice game pretty boy.'. Keith continued past us up the ramp. 

NEWMAN

A second later, something happened that changed us in a deep and profound way front that day forward. 

ELAINE

What was it? 

KRAMER

He spit on us.... and I screamed out, 'I'm hit!' 

NEWMAN

Then I turned and the spit ricochet of him and it hit me. 

ELAINE

Wow! What a story. 

JERRY

Unfortunately the immutable laws of physics contradict the whole premise of your account. Allow me to reconstruct this if I may for Miss Benes as I've heard this story a number of times. 

JERRY

Newman, Kramer, if you'll indulge me. According to your story Keith passes you and starts walking up the ramp then you say you were struck on the right temple. The spit then proceeds to ricochet off the temple striking Newman between the third and forth rib. The spit then cam off the rib turned and hit Newman in the right wrist causing him to drop his baseball cap. The spit then splashed off the wrist, Pauses In mid air mind you- makes a left turn and lands on Newman's left thigh. That is one magic luggie. 

NEWMAN

Well that's the way it happened. 

JERRY

What happened to your head when you got hit? 

KRAMER

Well. uh, well my head went back and to the left 

JERRY

Again 

KRAMER

Back and to the left 

JERRY

Back and to the left Back and to the left 

ELAINE

So, what are you saying? 

JERRY

I am saying that the spit could not have come from behind ... that there had to have been a second spitter behind the bushes on the gravelly road. If the spitter was behind you as you claimed that would have caused your head to pitch forward. 

ELAINE

So the spit could have only come from the front and to the right. 

JERRY

But that is not what they would have you believe. 

NEWMAN

I'm leavin'. Jerry's a nut. (Exits) 

KRAMER

Wait, wait, (Exits) 

JERRY

The sad thing is we may never know the real truth. 

GEORGE

(Frantically) Did anybody call here asking for Vandelay industries? 

JERRY

No. What happened to you? 

GEORGE

Now, listen closely. I was at the unemployment office and I told them that I was very close to getting a job with Vandelay Industries and I gave them your phone number. So, when now when the phone rings you've got to answer 'Vandelay Industries'. 

JERRY

I'm Vandelay Industries? 

GEORGE

Right. 

JERRY

And what is that? 

GEORGE

You're in latex 

JERRY

Latex? And what do I do with latex? 

GEORGE

Ya manufacture it. 

ELAINE

Here in this little apartment? 

JERRY

And what do I say about you? 

GEORGE

You're considering hiring me for your latex salesman. 

JERRY

I'm going to hire you as my latex salesman? 

GEORGE

Right. 

JERRY

I don't think so. Why would I do that? 

GEORGE

Because I asked you to. 

JERRY

If you think I'm looking for someone to just sit at a desk pushing papers around, you can forget it. I have enough headaches just trying to manufacture the stuff. 

JERRY

Yeah. 

KRAMER

It's Keith. 

JERRY

All right we're coming down. 

GEORGE

KEITH HERNANDEZ:? 

JERRY

Yeah, come on Elaine, lets go. 

GEORGE

Where are you goin? 

ELAINE

He's giving me a ride You know there had to have been a second spitter. But who was it? Who had the motive? 

JERRY

That's what I've been trying to figure out the past five years. 

GEORGE

What the hell are you two talking about? (All exit) 

JERRY

Well that was really fun, thanks. 

KEITH

Yeah, it really was. 

JERRY

Well, ... 

KEITH

GEORGE

What kind of a shake does he have? 

JERRY

KRAMER

I wouldn't have brought it up but since you mentioned it. 

ELAINE

Ha, I didn't mention it. 

KRAMER

Well I won them anyway. 

ELAINE

Well so what. I mean you played first base. I mean they always put the worst player on first base. That's were they put me and I stunk. 

KRAMER

Elaine. you don't know the first thing about first base. 

ELAINE

ha ha well I know something about getting to first base. And I know you'll never be there. 

KRAMER

The way I figure it I've already been there and I plan on rounding second tonight at around eleven o'clock. 

ELAINE

Well, uh, I'd watch the third base coach if I were you 'cause I don't think he's waving you in. You know I hate to say this but I think we're really hitting it off. Get it? Get it? 

KRAMER

GEORGE

Hate those couples. I could never bee one of those couples. There are no bald woman around. You know? 

JERRY

You know I know this sounds a little arrogant but I never thought she would find anyone she would like better than me. Ya know, I guess I had my chance and that's that. 

GEORGE

You know what I would like to do? I would really like to have sex with a tall woman. I mean really tall. Like a like a giant Like six five.

JERRY

GEORGE

Wow, ... god! You see this is all I think about. Sleeping with a giant. It's my life's ambition. 

JERRY

GEORGE

Magellan? You like Magellan? 

JERRY

Oh, yeah,. My favourite explorer. Around the world. Come on. 

GEORGE

GEORGE

What? The guy asked you to HELP HIM MOVE? Wow. 

JERRY

I know isn't that something? 

KRAMER

He's got money. Why doesn't he just pay a mover? 

JERRY

I don't know ... he's got some valuable antiques, He's worried they'll break something. 

GEORGE

Better bring your gloves, it's freezing out there. It shouldn't take too long. I'd say maybe, oh, four hours. Really though, Jerry, there's not that much. First we got the bedroom, we got two dressers and the bed. 

JERRY

Is there a box spring? 

KEITH

What's that? 

JERRY

Is there a box spring? 

KEITH

Yeah there's a box spring but it's attached to the headboard and we'll have to take that apart. Then we got the couch. 

JERRY

Is that a sectional? 

KEITH

Yeah. Twelve pieces. <not clear> ...coffee table. 

JERRY

Is that a thick marble? 

KEITH

Three inches thick. Got it in Italy. But the BIG problem is going to be the convertible sofa. You see when you move it it tends to open up so it's going to be real difficult getting it down the stairs. 

JERRY

STAIRS??? There's no elevator? 

KEITH

Nah, it's a brownstone. Three floors. 

JERRY

I'm sorry I can't do this. I can't do it. I can't. It, it's too soon. I don't know you. I can't help you move. I'm sorry. I can't. I just can't. 

KRAMER

Hello. 

KEITH

Hello. 

KRAMER

Oh, you don't remember me. 

KEITH

No should I [continuity error: in fact he SHOULD from the basketball game] 

KRAMER

Yeah, you should. I certainly remember you. Let me refresh your memory. 

NEWMAN

June 14th, 1987. Mets Phillies. You made a big error. Cost the Mets the game. Then you're coming up the parking lot ramp. 

KEITH

YOU said, 'Nice game, pretty boy.' 

KRAMER

Ah, you remember. 

NEWMAN

And then you spit on us. 

KEITH

Hey, I didn't spit at you. 

NEWMAN

Oh, yeah, right. 

KRAMER

No no no, well, then who was it? 

KEITH

Well lookit, the way I remember it (back to the grainy 8mm film parody) I was walking up the ramp. I was upset about the game. That's when you called me pretty boy. It ticked me off. I started to turn around to say something and as I turned around I saw Roger McDowell behind the bushes over by that gravely road. ... Anyway he was talking to someone and they were talking to you. I tried to scream out but it was too late. It was already on its way. 

JERRY

I told you! 

NEWMAN

Wow, it was McDowell. 

JERRY

But why? Why McDowell? 

KRAMER

Well, maybe because we were sitting in the right field stands cursing at him in the bullpen all game. 

NEWMAN

He must have caught a glimpse of us when I poured that beer on his head. 

NEWMAN

It was McDowell. 

KRAMER

Oh boy. Uh, look uh, Keith, uh, we're sorry. 

NEWMAN

Yeah, I couldn't be sorrier. I uh. 

KEITH

look guys, don't worry about it, I uh, Well I guess I better get going. 

KRAMER

Wait, uh what are ya' doing? 

KEITH

I gotta move. 

KRAMER

Want any help? 

KEITH

I'd love some. 

KRAMER

I'd love to help you move. 

NEWMAN

Me too. 

KEITH

Ok guys, we gotta be careful of one thing. Some of the stuff's very fragile We're going to have to handle it like a baby. 

KRAMER

No sweat. 

JERRY

Hello, ... oh hi Elaine .. what's going on ... no he just left ... you broke up with him? ... ME TOO .. what happened? ... oh smoking you know you're like going out with C. Everet Coope ... me ... nah ... I couldn't go through with it ... I just didn't feel ready ... so what are you doing now? ... Oh, great idea, I'll meet you there in like thirty minutes. Okay bye. 

GEORGE

Keith, Keith Wa What happened? Where's Keith? 

JERRY

You just missed him. he just left. What do you need him for? 

GEORGE

(out the window) Keith, Keith, up here. Can you do me a favor? I need you to go to the unemployment office with me. I, I'm Jerry's friend ... the guy from the locker room, ... I'm the chucker. It'll take five minutes. Wait. Wait. 

JERRY

Well Biff/ What's next? 

GEORGE

I don't know. 

GIRL

Excuse me. I was walking behind you and you dropped your wallet. 

GEORGE

It's all departures. I see nothing but departures. (to the woman beside him) Do you know where the arrivals are? 

GEORGE

Excuse me, sir, do you have the time? 

MAN

There's a clock over there. 

GEORGE

Where? 

MAN

(pointing) There. 

GEORGE

But you have a watch on. 

MAN

It's right by the escalator. 

GEORGE

Why don't you just look at your watch? 

MAN

I told you, it's right over there. 

GEORGE

Let me see the watch. 

MAN

Hey! What are you, some kind of nut?! 

GEORGE

You know we're living in a society! 

JERRY

George. 

GEORGE

Jerry. Jerry. 

JERRY

Sorry, the flight was delayed, how long've you been waiting? 

GEORGE

I just got here. My car broke down on the Belt Parkway. 

JERRY

Oh I can't believe-- why don't you get rid of that piece of junk. 

GEORGE

One mile from the exit it starts shaking, really violently shaking, like it's having a nervous breakdown. It completely stopped dead. 

JERRY

So you have no car? 

GEORGE

No. 

JERRY

So what good are you? 

JERRY

I'll tell you one thing, this chauffeur's gonna be waiting a while, O'Brien's not showing up. 

GEORGE

How do you know? 

JERRY

He was in Chicago, the flight was overbooked, wouldn't let him on the plane. He kept screaming how he had to get to Madison Square Garden. 

GEORGE

We should take his limo. 

JERRY

Yeah, right. 

GEORGE

Wait a second. Think about it. He's not showing up. Wait till you see the line of cabs, its like forty-five minutes long. You said he's in Chicago. 

JERRY

He's definitely in Chicago. 

GEORGE

Well the guy's just standing there. 

JERRY

How would we do it? 

GEORGE

We just go up to him, we say, 'We're O'Brien.' 

JERRY

Maybe he knows O'Brien? 

GEORGE

No, he doesn't know O'Brien, if he knew O'Brien he wouldn't have a sign. Let's just do it. 

JERRY

What if we get caught? 

GEORGE

What's gonna happen? They can't kill us. 

JERRY

Who's gonna be O'Brien? 

GEORGE

I'll be O'Brien. 

JERRY

Who am I? 

GEORGE

You're you. 

JERRY

Just me? 

GEORGE

Yeah. 

JERRY

Okay. 

GEORGE

What, you don't want to be you? 

JERRY

Well if you're gonna be O'Brien, why can't I be somebody? 

GEORGE

Like who? 

JERRY

Dylan Murphy. 

JERRY

What, now you wanna be Dylan Murphy? 

GEORGE

Well I like Dylan. 

JERRY

You could be Colin. 

GEORGE

Colin O'Brien. 

JERRY

I'm Dylan Murphy. 

GEORGE

I'm Colin O'Brien. 

GEORGE

Are we really doing this? 

JERRY

Come on, 

MAN

(to George) Hey, do you have the time? 

GEORGE

Clock over there. (to chauffer) O'Brien. 

CHAUFFEUR

Yes sir. 

GEORGE

Sorry we're late. 

CHAUFFEUR

Here let me take that for you. 

GEORGE

Oh thank you. 

CHAUFFEUR

I'll get the car and I'll bring it around front. 

GEORGE

Thank you very much. Dylan? 

JERRY

Colin? 

GEORGE

This is incredible! This is one of the greatest things I've ever done in my life! I'm gonna call my mother. 

JERRY

What for? 

GEORGE

I dunno, I'm in a limo. (dials) Hello ma? It's me. Guess where I am. In the back of a limo. No, nobody died. It's a long story, I can't tell you now. Because I can't. I said I can't. If I could, I would. Would you stop it? Alright, look, I'm getting off. No, I'm not telling you! How's this? I'm *never* telling you! I don't care! No! Fine! Never!! 

JERRY

She happy for you? 

GEORGE

Can he hear us? 

JERRY

No. Why? 

GEORGE

I thought I saw him look in the mirror suspiciously. 

JERRY

He can't hear us. 

GEORGE

Let's test him. Hey, driver. What do you say we stop off, pick up your sister, have a little fun back here? No, he can't hear us. 

JERRY

Where's he dropping us? Maybe we can get him to drop us right at my house? 

GEORGE

We'll ask him. (opens partition) My dear fellow, where are you dropping us? 

CHAUFFEUR

Madison Square Garden, of course. I have the four passes. 

GEORGE

Of course, the uh, the four passes. (closes partition) Four passes to Madison Square Garden? Wait a minute. Wait a minute! Of course! Chicago! The Knicks are playing the Bulls tonight! 

JERRY

What? 

GEORGE

We are going to the Knick game! Michael Jordan! 

JERRY

We're going to the Knick game! 

GEORGE

Did I tell you?! Did I tell you?! 

JERRY

I can't believe it! You may have hit with this one! 

GEORGE

You see, you see? I see things as they are and I say, 'no!' Uh, wait, you see things as they are not and you s- Wait, uh, you see things, do you see things as they are? What do you say when you see things? 

JERRY

Lemme call Elaine and Kramer. 

GEORGE

If I see things as they are, I would ask 'why' or 'why not?' 

JERRY

Elaine? It's me. What are you doing tonight? Great. George and I have tickets, four free passes to the Knicks-Bulls game, Madison Square Garden. Can you go? Great, listen, call Kramer, tell him to meet us on the corner at seven o'clock. Alright. We're gonna pick you up in a limo. That's right baby-doll. Hey listen, when we pick you up, I'm Murphy and George is O'Brien. I can't tell you now, it's a long story. I am serious. Okay. Okay bye. (opens partition) 'Scuse me, driver, we have to make a little stop first. 

CHAUFFEUR

I know. 

GEORGE

He knows? 

GEORGE

Where are we going? Why are we pulling off here? 

JERRY

Maybe it's a shortcut. 

GEORGE

We're on the Grand Central, there's no traffic. 

JERRY

(opens partition) 'Scuse me, driver, why are we getting off this exit? 

CHAUFFEUR

Pick up the other members of your party. 

GEORGE

Right. The other members of our party. (closes partition) Other members of our party? What other members of our party? I didn't even know we were in a party. Oh, I'm telling you, the jig is up. 

JERRY

It was a bad jig to begin with, we never should have started this jig. 

GEORGE

It was a good jig. 

JERRY

It was a bad jig, a terrible terrible jig. What are we gonna do now? They're gonna know you're not O'Brien. 

GEORGE

There could be more than one O'Brien on a plane who ordered a limo. 

JERRY

First of all, you don't look like any O'Brien, period. 

GEORGE

Well you should have been O'Brien. 

JERRY

I don't want to be Murphy anymore; do I still have to be Murphy? 

GEORGE

Yes, you have to be Murphy. 

JERRY

It makes no sense now, me being Murphy. 

GEORGE

You're Murphy! 

JERRY

I'm Seinfeld! 

GEORGE

You're Murphy!! Look, let's just jump out of the car. 

JERRY

We're doing sixty miles an hour! 

GEORGE

So we jump and roll, you won't get hurt. 

JERRY

Who are you, Mannix? 

GEORGE

We're slowing down. Are those the people? 

JERRY

Alright put your hands up over your face, pretend you're sleeping. 

WOMAN

(reaches out to Jerry) Mr. O'Brien? 

JERRY

No, I'm, uh, Dylan Murphy. Mr. O'Brien had a long trip, he's sleeping. 

EVA

(whispering) Oh, well I don't want to disturb him. We're just rather excited to meet him face to face, finally. We're faithful readers of his newsletter. 

JERRY

Newsletter? 

TIM

And of course, his great book, 'The Game'. 

JERRY

Oh, yes, he's very proud of his work in the big game. So you've never uh, met him before? 

EVA

No. 

JERRY

Never seen a picture of him? 

EVA

Never. 

JERRY

Not even on the book jacket? 

EVA

There was no picture on the book jacket. 

JERRY

(nudging George) Hey O'Brien, wake up, c'mon, we got company. Wake up. 

GEORGE

Hello. I'm O'Brien. 

KRAMER

Hey! 

ELAINE

Hey! 

KRAMER

What, you took a cab? 

ELAINE

Yeah? So? 

KRAMER

How much do you make? 

ELAINE

I'm not telling you. 

KRAMER

C'mon. 

ELAINE

No! 

KRAMER

I'll tell you how much I make. 

ELAINE

I know how much you make. I don't even know why I'm doing this, I don't even like basketball. 

KRAMER

You ever seen Michael Jordan? 

ELAINE

Just in those commercials. 

KRAMER

Maybe you'll see him do one of those three-sixty dunks. 

ELAINE

What's that? 

KRAMER

Oh, it's like this, here, you guard me. 

ELAINE

Huh? 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

JERRY

(checking his watch) I don't think we're gonna make the tip off. 

TIM

You think someone's been tipped off? 

GEORGE

So, um, you've read 'The Big Game', have you? 

EVA

(fawning) Yes I've read it and I've memorized it. 

GEORGE

Tell me your impressions, I would love to hear what a young woman thinks of 'The Big Game'. 

EVA

Well, this is sort of embarrassing, but it's changed my life. The way you analyzed the game? The way you identify the major players? Well it left me breathless. You're a brilliant, brilliant man. 

GEORGE

Well, it's just a game. Remember that, kids. 

TIM

Just a game. He's so humble. Don't forget what you wrote in the epilogue, the fate of the world depends on the outcome of this game. 

GEORGE

Well, I was exaggerating a bit, just for effect. 

JERRY

He tends to exaggerate. 

GEORGE

Okay, I mean it's serious but-- 

EVA

We are really looking forward to your speech tonight. 

GEORGE

Uh, my speech? 

EVA

Yes, your secretary faxed me the copy. Would you like to look it over? 

JERRY

Well you might as well look it over. 

KRAMER

So what's going on, how did all this happen? 

ELAINE

Jerry and George called me from this limo and they said we're all going to the Knicks-Bulls game. 

KRAMER

Limo? I thought that George went to pick him up. 

ELAINE

He did. 

KRAMER

Well then why would they take a limo from the airport? 

ELAINE

I don't know. 

KRAMER

That's pretty strange. Did he say anything else? 

ELAINE

Yeah. He said, um, he said it's really important that we call them O'Brien and Murphy. 

KRAMER

O'Brien. Why would he want to be called O'Brien? 

GEORGE

...and the Jews steal our money through their Zionist occupied government and use the black man to bring drugs into our oppressed white minority communities. 

JERRY

You're not going to open with that, are you? 

EVA

What was that you said about the myth of the Holocaust? 

GEORGE

I said so many things. 

GEORGE

They're shooting! They're shooting! 

TIM

(pulling out a gun) Alright, get down! 

GEORGE

That's really very nice of you, Eva. Thank you. 

EVA

But of course you know I would. I would do anything for you. Anything. 

TIM

Nothing to worry about, it was just a flat tire. But rest assured, we're prepared to handle anything that might come up. 

JERRY

Nice looking Lugar. 

JODI

I'm standing in front of the Paramount adjacent to Madison Square Garden where a growing number of vociferous and angry demonstrators are gathering to protest the very first public appearance of Donald O'Brien, the leader of the midwestern regional chapter of the Aryan Union, and reputed to be their most charismatic spokesman. The reclusive Mr. O'Brien is an advocate of the violent overthrow of the government. He has openly professed a deep admiration of Adolf Hitler. Even David Duke has denounced him as a dangerous extremist. There is a full house inside awaiting his arrival from the airport. Sources tell me he is in route and should be arriving momentarily. Police have set up barricades, but quite frankly Bill and Jean, I don't think they're any match for the emotional fuse that has been lit here tonight. Reporting from the Paramount, I'm Jodi Baskerville, back to you in the studio. 

KRAMER

Something's very strange. George goes to the airport to pick up Jerry. They come back in a limo with four tickets to the basketball game and wanna be called O'Brien and Murphy? O'Brien. O'Brien, why O'Brien? 

DAN

Elaine? 

ELAINE

Dan! Oh, hi Dan, how are you? 

DAN

Good. 

ELAINE

Um, oh, this is um, Kramer. 

DAN

Oh, Kramer? 

ELAINE

What's going on? 

DAN

Oh, we're heading down to protest this big neo-nazi rally. The head of the Aryan Union is speaking, he's in from Chicago. You should come. 

ELAINE

Oh, can't, I'm going to the Knicks-Bulls game. 

DAN

Oh, well that's where the rally is. The Paramount, right next door. 

ELAINE

Oh, well, maybe we'll run into you. 

DAN

Yeah, yeah ok. It's really gonna be something, this is the first time he's ever appeared in public, no one even knows what he looks like. 

KRAMER

Who? 

DAN

The head of the Aryan Union; O'Brien. 

JERRY

What's taking him so long out there? 

GEORGE

Didja see the way she was looking at me? 

JERRY

She's a Nazi, George. A Nazi! 

GEORGE

I know, I know. Kind of a cute Nazi though. 

JERRY

Well we gotta make a plan before they come back, what are we gonna do? 

GEORGE

I don't know. 

JERRY

Let's just make a run for it. 

GEORGE

I can't run, I have a bad hamstring. 

JERRY

How'd that happen? 

GEORGE

I hurt it in a hotel room. You know where they tuck the covers in real tight in those hotel rooms? I can't sleep like that so I tried to kick it out and I pulled it. 

JERRY

I know, why do they make that bed so tight? You gotta sleep with your feet like that. 

GEORGE

For a mental patient. Wait a minute, the phone, we'll call the police. 

GEORGE

9... 1... 1. She said she'd do anything. Hello, police? Uh, yeah listen, we're in the back of a limo in Queens-- 

GEORGE

--Astroturf? You know who's responsible for that, don't you?! The Jews! Ah, the Jews hate grass. They always have, they always will. 

TIM

We'll be ready in a minute. 

GEORGE

Would you excuse us for a minute Tim boy, we're kind of in the middle of something. 

TIM

With all due respect, Mr. O'Brien, we're just about to leave. 

GEORGE

Tim, who's the head of the Aryan Union, you or me? 

TIM

You are. 

GEORGE

And who's responsible for making hate mongering and fascism popular again? 

TIM

You are. 

GEORGE

Good. I think you forgot something. 

TIM

I'm sorry. 

GEORGE

Good. Now get out. 

GEORGE

Okay, what are we gonna do? 

JERRY

I don't know. 

GEORGE

Alright, how's this? We wait till we get to your street corner, we see Elaine and Kramer then we get out. They can't shoot us in the city. 

JERRY

Nah. No one's ever been shot in the city. 

KRAMER

I'm telling you, something's going on. I can feel it, sense it. 

ELAINE

I'm sure he was just joking around. 

KRAMER

Oh no no no, this is no joke. O'Brien's coming in from Chicago, Jerry's in a limo, says he's O'Brien? That's not funny. Oh my god. Yes. Yes! 

ELAINE

What is it? 

KRAMER

Don't you see? There's always been something very strange about Jerry, always so clean and organized. Do I have to spell it out for you? The limo? The name? The rally at Madison Square Garden? Jerry, O'Brien are the same person. Jerry is the leader of the Aryan Union! 

ELAINE

Jerry's a nazi?! 

KRAMER

I can't believe I didn't see it. 

ELAINE

Listen, you idiot! Just calm down! I know Jerry, he's not a nazi. 

KRAMER

You don't think so. 

ELAINE

No, he's just neat. 

TIM

You know it's funny. You don't look like an O'Brien. 

GEORGE

Me?? 

TIM

And you really don't look like a Murphy. 

JERRY

I may not look like a Murphy but I act like a Murphy. 

GEORGE

He's extremely Murphy. He's Murphy to a fault. 

TIM

Where are you from? 

JERRY

Dublin. Originally. Parents came over here when I was eighteen. Cereal famine. Couldn't get a bowl anywhere. Bad. 'Tis a beautiful country though; lush rolling hills, and the peat, ah the peat. 

TIM

Sounds more like Scottish. 

JERRY

We were right on the border. 

KRAMER

Maybe he's with the company. 

ELAINE

What? 

KRAMER

The CIA! Maybe they placed him in there to infiltrate the organization from within. 

ELAINE

What about his comedy act? 

KRAMER

That's the perfect cover! All that time on the road? Look Jerry, he's too normal to be a comedian. These comedians, they're sick, neurotic people. 

ELAINE

What about George? 

KRAMER

What about him, he's part of it. His whole personality is a disguise. No real person can act the way he does. Elaine, I'm telling you they're with the organization. They're all part of it. He's in there with Helms and Hunt and Liddy, that whole crowd. George and Jerry, they probably know who killed Kennedy! 

ELAINE

I'll bet they were even in on it. 

KRAMER

Alright, what are we gonna do? I'm not gonna let him hurt you. (grabs and hugs Elaine tightly) I'm not gonna. 

ELAINE

Kramer, you're hurting me! 

GEORGE

Those are my friends I was telling you about. We're gonna talk to them, pull over. 

ELAINE

Get off of me!! 

KRAMER

O'Brien. 

MEN

Let's get him!! 

GEORGE

What do I do?! What do I do?! 

JERRY

Get in the car! Get in the car! 

KRAMER

(pointing to Jerry) O'Brien. Long time no see. How's tricks, Murphy? 

TIM

Why did you call him O'Brien and him Murphy? 

JERRY

No, he was talking to me, he's cross-eyed. 

ELAINE

It could be very confusing. 

KRAMER

Yeah? Eva? 

EVA

It's for me. (takes phone) Hello? (cups receiver) It's O'Brien. 

KRAMER

O'Brien? Well that's weird. 

EVA

(gun drawn) Who are you? 

JODI

A limousine has just pulled up it's being surrounded by a huge group of protestors, this has the makings of a very ugly scene. 

JODI

They are banging on the car, trying to flip it over. The police seem unable or unwilling to control the crowd, I would imagine Mr. O'Brien must be having some very grave doubts if he made the right choice for his first public appearance. 

EVA

Get out!! 

ELAINE

Look, it's Dan! Hi Dan! 

DAN

Elaine? 

ELAINE

Hey! 

GEORGE

I am not O'Brien! I am not O'Brien! I'm not O'Brien! Ask anyone! Jerry?! Jerry?!! 

ELAINE

You know it's bad enough you have a car phone, you have to use the speaker? 

JERRY

It's safer! Plus it's more annoying to the other person. 

JERRY

Oh look at this guy. 

ELAINE

What's goin' on? 

JERRY

Oh there's a guy trying to get in front of me, he has to ask permission. Yes. Go ahead. Get in, get in. 

ELAINE

Did you get a thank you wave? 

JERRY

No, nothing. How could you not give a thank you wave? Hey buddy! Where's my thank you wave? 

JERRY

Give me that wave! 

ELAINE

Jerry, are you free on Friday? 

JERRY

Yeah, I'm free, why? 

ELAINE

Ah, God, I bumped into Robin Sandusky today, she asked me to have dinner with her and her husband. 

JERRY

Oh my God! You won't believe what I just saw! A car just bashed into a parked car, and sped off, right on my block! 

ELAINE

You gotta follow that car! 

JERRY

What? 

ELAINE

You can't let him get away with that! 

JERRY

Elaine, the guy could be dangerous. 

ELAINE

What are you, yellow? 

JERRY

I'm not yella. (In a cowboy voice) 

ELAINE

Jerry, if you don't follow him, you're yella. 

JERRY

Wait, he stopped, he's parking. 

ELAINE

What? What? I can't hear you. Jerry? 

JERRY

Uh, excuse me, uh, I was uh, driving behind you, uh, a few blocks back, and I, I couldn't help, uh, maybe you didn't realize, uh, I witnessed that, uh, um, you're tire's a little low. That can affect the performance of the twin high-beam suspension, not to mention your rack and pinion steering. 

JERRY

So I wound up going out for a decaf cappuccino with her. 

GEORGE

Boy! What a story! I'm speechless. Speechless. I have no speech. 

JERRY

You know, I really liked her. We talked. We flirted. And when she left, she reached out and touched my arm. 

JERRY

He, he, he. (Simulating her feminine laugh) 

GEORGE

I love when they touch your arm. I can't get enough of that. Why is that? 

JERRY

Let's not even analyze it. 

GEORGE

So you didn't turn her in? 

JERRY

I wanted to but I couldn't go through with it. 

GEORGE

Gonna see her again? 

JERRY

Friday night. 

JERRY

Yep. 

ELAINE

It's me! 

JERRY

Come on up. 

JERRY

By the way, Elaine does not need to know about anything. 

GEORGE

Hey, hey, hey! I dig. 

JERRY

Oh, you dig? 

GEORGE

Yes! I see enormous potential here. 

JERRY

Why? 

GEORGE

Because great couples always have a great story about how they met. That's why I've never been in a long term relationship. I've never had a good meeting story. 

JERRY

I wonder if I'm nuts for pursuing this woman at all. 

GEORGE

I don't think so. 

JERRY

Look, she slammed into a parked car! She took no responsibility for mutilating the property of a stranger, then she sped off like a criminal! 

JERRY

On the other hand, does that mean she should never be allowed to date again? You scratch one car and you're forbidden to have social contact for the rest of your life?! 

JERRY

What am I drinking, milk? 

ELAINE

Hey! 

JERRY

Hi. 

ELAINE

Sweater. 

JERRY

Thank you. 

ELAINE

So? What happened? 

JERRY

With that? 

ELAINE

With the car! 

JERRY

What car? 

ELAINE

The hit and run! 

JERRY

Oh, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, the hit and run. Well. Actually, the guy went into Queens. 

ELAINE

Queens?! You followed him over the bridge? 

JERRY

Over the bridge. (Making a pointing motion with his hand) 

GEORGE

Oh, well I didn't know you went into Queens Jerry. 

JERRY

Yeah, Queens. 

ELAINE

So? Then what? 

JERRY

So he gets out of the car, I say, 'Hey buddy! I saw you hit that car!' So he says to me, 'What are ya gonna do about it?' 

JERRY

So I said to him, 'Whatever's necessary.' 

ELAINE

I am speechless. I am without speech. 

GEORGE

Tell her about the shoving. 

JERRY

What? 

ELAINE

What shoving?! 

JERRY

Oh, it was nothing. 

GEORGE

No! Tell her. 

JERRY

Well he kinda lost his temper, and he was pushing me up against the car. So I went into a karate stance. (Jerry assumes karate position and does two punches) 

ELAINE

You know karate?? 

JERRY

I know a little. 

ELAINE

Well, this is so, amazing to me! Jerry what did do? 

JERRY

He backed off. Pretty pathetic actually. 

KRAMER

Hey! (Group does likewise) 

ELAINE

Did you tell Kramer? 

JERRY

Ah, nah! (Waving his hand and walking away) 

KRAMER

What? What? What? Tell me. 

ELAINE

Jerry saw this guy crash into a car, and he followed him. 

KRAMER

Good for you! What kind of a sick lowlife would do a thing like that? You know those people, you know they're mentally disturbed. (Pointing a finger at Jerry) 

KRAMER

They should be sent to Australia. 

JERRY

Australia? 

KRAMER

Yeah, yeah, that's where England used to send their convicts. 

JERRY

But not anymore. 

KRAMER

No. 

ELAINE

Hey Kramer, Kramer! 

KRAMER

Yeah? 

ELAINE

What happened to you right here? (She pointing to her forehead) 

KRAMER

I don't know! 

KRAMER

You know I was watching Entertainment Tonight, and uh, suddenly I got dizzy. And the next thing I know I hit my head on the coffee table. 

ELAINE

Well, that is, that is strange. 

KRAMER

Yep. (Mumbles off) 

ELAINE

Alright, oh Jerry, we're still on for Friday night, right? 

JERRY

Oh Friday, I can't, I'm sorry, I have a date. 

ELAINE

But last night you said you were free! (Sounding very disappointed) 

JERRY

We just met. 

KRAMER

Maybe it was a reaction to the sardines. 

ELAINE

But I, I can't go alone! 

JERRY

Ask George to go with you. 

ELAINE

George, come on! I'll pay for you. 

GEORGE

You'll pay? I'm there. 

JERRY

Why do you even need anybody? 

ELAINE

Because I hate being at a table alone, with a married couple. Talking about their married friends, and their married furniture. They're always trying to make me feel like their life is so much better than mine. You know, I have a very exciting life. It's very exciting. (As she's closing the door to leave) 

ROBIN

You went out with a bullfighter? 

ELAINE

Yes, well, an ex-bullfighter now. 

MICHAEL

Wow. 

ROBIN

What was his name? 

ELAINE

His name? Name, um, his name was uh, uh, Eduardo Carochio. 

GEORGE

Pass the salt please. 

ROBIN

Where did you meet him? 

ELAINE

Um, actually, I met him in Switzerland, and he was fighting uh, is that the word they use? Fighting? Because they don't really fight the bull, they avoid fighting the bull. 

GEORGE

Bread. 

ELAINE

I just love meeting new people. You know that's how you really do learn about life. 

GEORGE

God bless you. 

ROBIN

Thank you. 

GEORGE

I wasn't going to say anything, but then I could see that he wasn't going to open his mouth. (Chuckles) 

WOMAN

You know who's a good actor? Anthony Quinn. 

JERRY

Oh, Anthony Quinn, fine actor. But from what I understand, not a very good driver. Hits everything on the road. But always leaves a note. 

WOMAN

Did you ever see Zorba the Greek? 

JERRY

Excellent film. In fact Quinn said he never felt so good as when he left a note after smacking into a car. 

WOMAN

Come here. (moves in for a kiss) 

GEORGE

Really, I was, I was only kidding around. 

ROBIN

He was only joking Michael. 

MICHAEL

You think you're so damn special because you say 'God bless you'? 

GEORGE

No, no, I don't think I'm special. My mother always said I'm not special. 

ROBIN

He was only joking Michael! Sorry. 

MICHAEL

All right! Take his side! 

ROBIN

I am not taking his side. 

MICHAEL

Well who's side are you taking?! 

ROBIN

Well I'm not taking your side! 

JERRY

Kirk Douglas. Now there's another very bad driver. But he's such an unbelievable guy, that when he hits someone, he doesn't even leave a note. He sits in his car and waits for the other person to show up so he can exchange license, registration, and apologize. 

GEORGE

I said 'God bless you'. Was that so wrong? 

JERRY

The question is, did you allow a space for the husband to come in with his 'God bless you'? Because as the husband, he has the right to first refusal. 

ELAINE

It's me. 

JERRY

Come on up. 

GEORGE

Yes, yes, I definitely waited. But let me say this: Once he passes on that option, that 'God bless you' is up for grabs. 

JERRY

No argument. Unless, she's one of these multiple sneezers, and he's holding his 'God bless you' in abeyance, until she completes the series. 

GEORGE

Well I don't think she is a multiple sneezer, because she sneezed again later, and it was also a single. 

JERRY

What if she's having an off night? 

ELAINE

Hi! 

JERRY

Hi. 

ELAINE

Well! If it isn't mister gesuntheit! 

GEORGE

Oh ya, like there's something wrong with saying 'God bless you'. I was raised to say 'God bless you'. 

GEORGE

Ah, shut up. 

ELAINE

What does it mean anyway? 'God bless you'. It's a stupid 'stuperstition'. 

JERRY

A stupid what? 

ELAINE

Whatever. 

JERRY

You know, if you want to make a person feel better after they sneeze, you shouldn't say 'God bless you', you should say, 'You're soo good lookin''. 

ELAINE

Yeah, yeah, that's better than 'God bless you'. Anyway, she left a message on my machine, she wants you to call her. 

GEORGE

Who? 

ELAINE

Robin! 

GEORGE

Why?! 

ELAINE

Well I assumed she called to apologize, that's why she called me. 

JERRY

Entertainment Tonight's on. 

GEORGE

Where's the remote phone? 

JERRY

Bedroom. 

ELAINE

Hey, grab Jerry's sweater for me, would you? 

JERRY

What's it like out? 

ELAINE

Chilly out. 

JERRY

Can I take a sweater? 

ELAINE

Yeah, you can take a sweater if you want to. 

JERRY

Scarf? 

ELAINE

Nah, hey, shut this off, shut it off. 

JERRY

What's the matter? What's going on? 

KRAMER

What happened?! 

ELAINE

What? 

KRAMER

I think I hit my head again! 

JERRY

What is wrong?! 

ELAINE

Hey, hey, wait a minute! Let me ask you something. Kramer, the last time you hit your head, was Mary Hart on TV? 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

ELAINE

That is it! 

KRAMER

What? 

ELAINE

That is it! Mary Hart's voice, don't you see? There's something about Mary Hart's voice that's giving you seizures. Just like, just like, just like that woman in Albany! 

KRAMER

Mary Hart! 

GEORGE

God. 

ELAINE

What? 

GEORGE

Well she apologized, and then she wanted to know if we could get together Wednesday afternoon. 

JERRY

Get together? 

GEORGE

Maybe she just wants to talk to me? 

ELAINE

Married women don't 'get together'. They have affairs. 

GEORGE

Oh my God, an affair. That's so adult. It's like with stockings and martinis, and William Holden. On the other hand it probably wouldn't cost me any money. 

ELAINE

Are you actually considering this? 

GEORGE

I can't have an affair with a married woman, that's despicable! 

ELAINE

Yeah, it's like hitting a car and driving away without leaving a note. 

JERRY

Yeah. 

KRAMER

Hey, you know who owns that car? 

JERRY

What car? 

KRAMER

The one that was hit a couple of nights ago. 

JERRY

Yeah who? 

KRAMER

That blond across the street. You know the one with the long ponytail, she wears those blue sweatpants. 

JERRY

The blond with the blue sweatpants! Yeah, I think I've seen her. 

ELAINE

Well I've got to get going. I'm meeting a guy with grey sweatpants. 

KRAMER

Wait, wait, wait, how do you know it's not John Tesh? 

JERRY

The blond with the blue sweatpants! 

GEORGE

Well, who is she? 

JERRY

I've had a crush on this woman for year! I've always been afraid to approach her! She looks like she belongs on one of these Hallmark cards. 

GEORGE

Oh right, right! The blue sweatpants! Gees, it's too bad you can't say anything because of Angela. 

JERRY

Oh yeah. Too bad. Angela. Lousy thug. I mean what kind of sick person does something like that? That woman belongs in prison! I mean, I actually owe it to society to do something about this! I can't sit by and allow this to go on. It's a moral issue is what it is! 

GEORGE

You can't compromise your principles! 

JERRY

How am I going to live with myself?! 

GEORGE

Can't live! 

JERRY

I'm not religious, but I certainly know where to draw the line! 

GEORGE

This country needs more people like you! 

JERRY

Don't sell yourself short saying 'God bless you' to every Tom, Dick and Harry in great personal risk. 

GEORGE

I believe strongly in that as you know. 

JERRY

There should be more people like us. 

GEORGE

That's why the world's in the shape it's in. 

JERRY

You're telling me. 

JERRY

Anyway, I just wanted you to know, that I'm going to do everything I can to make sure the party responsible is made to be responsible or something very close to that. 

BECKY

Well God bless you. 

JERRY

Thank you very much. 

GEORGE

Oh my God. I must be crazy. What have I done? 

ROBIN

Oh no, what's wrong? 

GEORGE

What's wrong? I'll tell you what's wrong. I just committed adultery! 

ROBIN

You didn't commit adultery, I did. 

GEORGE

Oh yeah. 

ROBIN

If I didn't do it with you, I would have done it with someone else. 

GEORGE

Well, I wouldn't want you to do that. You know there's a lot of losers out there. 

ROBIN

Maybe even someone who didn't say 'God bless you'. 

GEORGE

Well, that's a given. 

ROBIN

In three years with Michael, not one 'God bless you'. 

GEORGE

Must be hell living in that house. 

MICHAEL

Hi, it's Michael. 

ELAINE

Hi, Michael! 

MICHAEL

Is Robin there? 

ELAINE

Robin? No, why? 

MICHAEL

Uh, she said she was going to be with you. 

ELAINE

No I haven't spoken to her all day-uh, yeah right, um, as a matter of fact, um, she was here, and she uh, left a note, but I wasn't here, but I have the note, uh, right here. 

MICHAEL

If she's not with you, then where is she? 

ELAINE

Well I, I don't know. 

MICHAEL

Is she with your bald friend from the other night?! 

ELAINE

No, no, come on Michael! 

MICHAEL

He's finished! I'm going to sew his ass to his face! I'm going to twist his neck so hard his lips will be his eyebrows! I'm going to break his joints, and reattach them! 

ELAINE

You're soo good lookin'. 

ANGELA

Now you listen to me, suck face! You tell anybody, anything, and I will carve my initials in your brain tissue! 

JERRY

Let me rephra- 

ANGELA

I'll bash your skull into a vegematic like a bad cabbage, and I'll have a party on your head! 

JERRY

Hi Elaine, this is Angela. 

ANGELA

I'll pluck all your body hairs out with my teeth! 

JERRY

Well I think I get the gist of it. 

ANGELA

So you don't say anything to anybody about me hitting that car! 

JERRY

What car? 

ANGELA

Good. I'm glad we understand each other. 

JERRY

It's not complicated. 

ELAINE

Very nice meeting you! 

ELAINE

Come on up. 

ELAINE

Well, well, well, Mr. Seinfeld! That must have been so frightening! When you confronted that guy, in Queens! Now, let's just see if I've got this scenario right. 

JERRY

Alright Elaine. 

ELAINE

No, no, no, no, no. Because I'm picturing 'French Connection', kind of thing. You know? Sort of a Popeye Doyle chase through the city! 

JERRY

It was just a couple of blocks. 

ELAINE

Oh no, no, come on. Don't be so modest! 

GEORGE

Hey. 

ELAINE

Oh, did you check you machine? 

GEORGE

No, why, what's happening? 

ELAINE

Michael called me today, and he asked me where Robin was. 

GEORGE

Yeah, okay. 

ELAINE

And I said I hadn't seen her. 

GEORGE

What?! 

ELAINE

No, no George! You don't understand! She didn't tell me she was using me as an excuse! Okay?! But then I realized what was going on, and I said that she left a note. Um, but he didn't really buy that. And then, and then he did mention your name. 

GEORGE

He mentioned my name?! What did he say?! 

ELAINE

He said he was going to sew your ass to your face. 

GEORGE

What? Why couldn't you think of something?! 

ELAINE

Well I don't know, he caught me off guard! 

GEORGE

You lie! How hard is it to lie?! 

JERRY

It's not that hard. 

ELAINE

Well who told you to sleep with her George?! 

GEORGE

It's not my fault! I wasn't going to do anything until you got her all juiced up with your story about having the affair with the matador! 

ELAINE

Oh Gosh! None of this would never have happened if you wouldn't have said 'God bless you'! 

GEORGE

Oh don't- 

JERRY

Hold it! Hold it! Hold it people! Matador? What matador? 

GEORGE

She told this couple she had an affair with a matador. 

JERRY

A matador! Well, well, well. Uno momento por favor. Pray tell, what was the young man's name? 

ELAINE

Uh, Eduardo, uh, Carochio. 

JERRY

Eduardo, Carochio! That's good. That's very good. Kind of just rolls of the tongue. I wonder where on the upper west side a single girl might meet a matador? Perhaps Zabars? Or Les Pizza! 

JERRY

Anyway, this person told me to tell you to get an estimate on the damage. 

BECKY

Well, I already got an estimate. It's $875. 

JERRY

$875? 

BECKY

That's right. 

JERRY

Uh, well, I'll tell you what. Um, I'll give you a check, and then this person can pay me back. 

JERRY

Um, who do I make it out to? 

BECKY

Becky Gelke. G-E-L-K-E. 

JERRY

So, what are you doing this weekend? 

BECKY

You have got some nerve! You smash up my car, you don't admit it, and now you want to ask me out on a date? 

JERRY

I didn't do it! 

BECKY

Yeah righ- 

JERRY

You are soo good lookin'. 

BECKY

Thank you. 

GEORGE

Jerry, let's go! You ready? 

JERRY

You sure you want to do this? I'm going to be on the road for three weeks! 

GEORGE

Excuse me, I've got a maniac stalking me, I'm not staying in the city. 

JERRY

Alright! 

GEORGE

Come on let's get out of here. 

KRAMER

How could you? 

JERRY

What?! 

KRAMER

Man! I never thought you were capable of this! 

JERRY

What did I do? 

KRAMER

I just talked to Becky Gelke outside, she told me how you hit and ran. 

JERRY

I- 

KRAMER

I don't even want to look at you anymore! All these years of friendship and you're nothing but a felon. You're an embarrassment to the building. 

JERRY

I didn't do it! I just had to pay her to cover for somebody else! 

KRAMER

Now you're not going to lie to me, are you? 

JERRY

No, never. 

KRAMER

Alright. Well. Glad we got that straightened out because I've got a date with her. 

JERRY

You got a date with Becky Gelke?! 

KRAMER

Yeah, going out with her Saturday night. 

GEORGE

Jerry, can we get out of here?! 

KRAMER

As a matter of fact, if it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have even had an excuse to talk to her. 

JERRY

Well I'm happy to help, in any way that I can. 

NINA

(laughing) Kramer, would you hold still? I can't do this if you keep moving. 

KRAMER

You sure you don't want me to take my clothes off? (beat) I'll do it! 

NINA

No, that's the last thing in the world I want you to do. 

KRAMER

Well, why don't you take your clothes off? 

NINA

I don't know... I don't think Jerry would like that. 

KRAMER

(debonair smile) Well, it'd be our little secret. 

TO

Jerry's apartment] 

GEORGE

(bursting out of the bathroom, fumbling with his fly) Button fly! Why do they put buttons on a fly? It takes ten minutes to get these things open! 

JERRY

I like the button fly. 

GEORGE

(incredulous) What? 

JERRY

That is one place on my wardrobe I do not need sharp interlocking metal teeth. It's like a mink trap down there. (beat) What are you doing today? 

GEORGE

Nothing. 

JERRY

I have to go meet Nina. Want to come up to her lot, check out her paintings? 

GEORGE

I don't get art. 

JERRY

There's nothing to get. 

GEORGE

Well, it always has to be explained to me, and then I have to have someone explain the explanation. 

JERRY

She does a lot of abstract stuff. In fact she's painting Kramer right now. 

GEORGE

What for? 

JERRY

She sees something in him. 

GEORGE

So do I, but I wouldn't hang it on a wall. 

TO

Nina's studio again--same scene] 

KRAMER

Are you getting the eyes? 'Cause they're brown. (beat) Or, really, they're dark brown, like rich, Columbian coffee. 

NINA

Tell me about Elaine. 

KRAMER

She and Jerry were a big thing, like Abe Lincoln and Mary Todd. 

NINA

But, they're still friends. 

KRAMER

Oh yeah, they're like this (holds up two fingers together). 

NINA

Don't you think that's strange? 

KRAMER

Why, what's the difference? 

NINA

Well, are you still friends with any of your ex-girlfriends? 

KRAMER

Well, you know... I, uh... have many relationships. 

TO

the door outside Nina's studio] 

GEORGE

You know, I'm a little nervous. 

JERRY

Why? 

GEORGE

Well, you know... the friend meeting the new woman. I feel like I'm getting fixed up for a friendship. 

JERRY

I don't know how long this is gonna last. 

GEORGE

Really? I thought you liked her. 

JERRY

I do... she's got like a jealousy thing. She doesn't like me having fun with anyone but her. (knocks on the door) 

GEORGE

You know, it's a miracle you're not married. (beat) Hey, I'm not obligated to buy anything, am I? 

JERRY

Hi, Nina. (smooch) This is my friend George. 

NINA

How nice to meet you, I've heard a lot about you. (George nods) 

JERRY

(walking over to where Kramer is posing) Hey, look at this guy! 

KRAMER

Yeah! 

JERRY

(to Nina) I brought George up to see some of your paintings. 

NINA

Oh, are you interested? 

GEORGE

(looking uncomfortable) Um... yeah! Sure, sure I'm interested. 

KRAMER

George, you gonna buy a painting? 

GEORGE

(gritting teeth) Yeah, sure. 

NINA

Are you an art-lover? 

GEORGE

I am an art-adorer! I adore art. 

NINA

Great! Well, take a look around. Pick out something you like. (George reluctantly begins to look around, while Jerry strolls over to the painting-in-progress [Kramer] and picks up a brush.) 

JERRY

May I? (pantomimes making a big 'X' across the painting) 

NINA

(laughing) Get outta here! (beat) Here, play with this. (hands Jerry a small white envelope) 

JERRY

What's this? 

NINA

My father gave me four tickets to the Yankee game for Saturday afternoon. Owner's box, first row behind the dugout. 

JERRY

(sincerely disappointed) Oh, Saturday... I'm working, I'm going out of town. 

NINA

Oh, well. I'm not gonna go without you. Do you guys want 'em? 

KRAMER

(immediately) Yeah. 

JERRY

They're right behind the dugout, George, first row! 

GEORGE

Behind the dugout, are you kidding? How did you get them? 

NINA

Oh, my father's the Yankees accountant... it's the owner's box. 

GEORGE

All my life I've dreamed of sitting front row, behind the dugout! 

NINA

(gesturing towards a small, ugly painting George was apparently look-ing at and happens to be holding) You like that one? 

TO

Saturday, the game. George, Kramer, and Elaine are being lead to their seats] 

GEORGE

Look at where we are! (referring to the seat usher) He's not stopping! He just keeps going and going and going! (the usher abruptly stops at the second row) We're not in the first row? 

USHER

No, no, these are your seats. 

GEORGE

She said first row! Right behind the dugout! 

ELAINE

Well, it's the second row. It's just as good. 

GEORGE

I was all primed for the first row; I was gonna put my feet up on the dugout! 

ELAINE

Would you shut up? These are great! You can't get any better than this. 

GEORGE

Oh, there's better, (pointing at the row in front of them) right there, that's better. 

KRAMER

Right. (Elaine giggles) Oh boy... okay, who wants a dog? (Kramer hands out the hot dogs)What a great day! 

ELAINE

I could've been at my boss' son's bris right now. 

GEORGE

(amused) You're supposed to do that? 

ELAINE

(shrugs) Yeah. (beat) What makes you think anyone would want to go to a circumcision? 

GEORGE

I'd rather go to a hanging. 

ELAINE

Anyway, I called him back... I told him I had to go visit my father in the hospital in Maryland. (George laughs) 

KRAMER

(screaming at the players on the field) YOU BETTER CATCH IT, 

MAN

George? 

GEORGE

Yeah? 

MAN

Hi. I'm Leonard West, Nina's father. 

GEORGE

Hi! Mr. West, this is my friend Elaine-- 

ELAINE

Hi! 

KRAMER

(screaming again) HEY, 230 AIN'T GONNA CUT IT IN THIS TOWN, BABE! 

GEORGE

--and this is Kramer. 

KRAMER

Oh, hey. 

WEST

So how are the seats? 

GEORGE

Okay. 

ELAINE

Great, great. 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

WEST

George, I heard you bought one of Nina's paintings. 

GEORGE

Yeah, it's being framed right now. I don't even know what it costs. (beat) Not, uh, too expensive, is it? 

WEST

Well, if you have a lot of money. 

WEST

(leaving) Well, enjoy the game. (beat -- to Elaine) I think you better take off that Orioles cap. 

ELAINE

(thinking he's joking) Yeah. I better! 

WEST

No, no, no. Seriously. You're in the owner's box, and I don't think it's a good idea. 

ELAINE

You're not serious. 

WEST

Yes, yes, yes, I am! 

ELAINE

Well, did he say that? 

WEST

No, no, but he gave me the seats. I don't think he'd like it if you wore an Orioles cap. 

ELAINE

Well maybe you should ask him! 

WEST

I don't have to ask him! Now are you gonna take the hat off or not? 

ELAINE

No! I don't have to take it off, why should I take it off? This is ridiculous!! 

GEORGE

Just take the cap off. 

ELAINE

George, we are at a baseball game! This is America! 

WEST

Look. Either you take the cap off, or you'll have to leave. 

ELAINE

Well, I don't care, I'm not taking it off. 

GEORGE

Just take the cap off! 

ELAINE

No! 

KRAMER

Hey! Just wait a minute. We just got here! 

GEORGE

(to Elaine) Do you want us to go with you? 

KRAMER

(getting up) I'll go get your hat, George. 

ELAINE

(sarcastically, to George) Stay! 

GEORGE

Okay, we'll go! 

ELAINE

...and then the ball hits him in the head and he falls right over the railing! 

JERRY

Is he okay? 

ELAINE

Well, yeah, he's fine! We took him to the emergency room, and you know, the x-rays were all negative. (beat) It was quite a day! 

JERRY

This is the most amazing story I've ever heard--why did he want you to take off the baseball cap? That is so insane! 

ELAINE

I know! Can you imagine that? 

JERRY

How you feeling? 

KRAMER

Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. (beat--holds up newspaper) Hey, we made the paper. Eh? Look at this- page 2, sports section... we're all in the picture. 

ELAINE

Wha- a picture? 

KRAMER

A picture. 

ELAINE

OUR PICTURE'S IN THERE?? 

KRAMER

Uh-huh. 

ELAINE

(gasps) I cannot believe this! 

JERRY

(pointing) There's George! 

KRAMER

Yup, yup! 

ELAINE

Ohmygod! Lippman could see this! He thinks I was visiting my father! Oh my g-I make up one little white lie and they put my picture in the paper! 

TO

Lippman's office. Lippman is at his desk, Elaine enters.] 

ELAINE

Hi, Mr. Lippman. 

ELAINE

My, my father? 

ELAINE

Yeah. 

ELAINE

I went to visit him. 

ELAINE

Well, you name it, uh, neuritis, uh, neuralgia... 

ELAINE

Um, yup. Yes, yes, it just... such a miracle, um. My visit must have buoyed (Elaine says 'boyed') his spirits. 

ELAINE

What--what did I say? 

ELAINE

I did? 

ELAINE

Oh! Where are you going? 

ELAINE

Ah. ...Yeah. 

ELAINE

There's nothing to read, it's just yesterday's news. You know, the Yankees won, the Mets lost, Ricky Henderson's unhappy... 

ELAINE

Wha-- oh! (noticing her hand) Oh, god! (laughs) That is the THIRD time today I have done that! BLAAAH! (laughs again) Grabbing news- papers... I'm just tugging at 'em... (laughs) 

ELAINE

Okay! Well, you know, have a nice trip, and uh... alrighty! (beat) I'll just hold down the, uh, fort! 

TO

Nina's studio. Mr. and Mrs. Armstrong are admiring Nina's 'Kramer.'] 

TO

Another part of the studio where Jerry and Nina are arguing.] 

NINA

She was a guest of my father's. She should've taken the cap off. 

JERRY

It's preposterous! They ask someone to take off a baseball cap at a baseball game. (beat) How can you defend that? 

TO

Armstrongs admiring painting again.] 

TO

Jerry and Nina again.] 

JERRY

Look, I'm really getting tired off all the fighting. Maybe we should just end this before we really start hating each other. 

NINA

Oh, well, you wouldn't want that because you always have to remain friends! 

JERRY

Well, I like to remain friends with people I was friends with! 

NINA

Hey -- why don't you just go then! And -- oh, give this to George. Tell him he owes me $500! 

TO

Armstrongs] 

TO

Jerry's apartment.] 

GEORGE

Five-hundred dollars?! What? 

JERRY

That's what she told me! 

GEORGE

I'm not paying $500 for this! It's a piece of junk! 

JERRY

That's what it costs! 

GEORGE

Why did you even take it? You broke up with her! 

JERRY

I wasn't thinking! I don't know. 

GEORGE

You weren't thinking. 

JERRY

Well, she framed it and everything. 

GEORGE

Well, I'm not buying it. No way. Forget it. No way I'm buying this! (beat) I mean, look at it! What is it? It's a bunch of squiggly lines! (beat) Are you telling me you couldn't paint this? 

JERRY

Do you want me to paint you something? I'd love to paint you some- thing! 

GEORGE

I'm not paying for this. If you were going out with her, it'd be a different story. 

KRAMER

(entering, handing Jerry a piece of paper) This was in front of your door. 

GEORGE

Hey, Kramer. 

KRAMER

Hi, Mike. 

JERRY

(looking at the paper) Wow, a letter from Nina! 

KRAMER

(notices the painting) Whoa, man! That is the ugliest thing I've ever seen! 

JERRY

(reading note) Oh my god! 

GEORGE

What? 

JERRY

This is amazing, you can't believe this! 

GEORGE

What's it say? 

JERRY

Listen to this: 'I don't know what you expect to find out there, Jerry, you know what you want better than me. But there's one thing I do know. I know I can stand here watching you destroy everything I've ever wanted in my life, wanting to smash your face with my fists, because you won't make even the slightest effort to offer happiness and still know that I love you. You mean so much to me that I'm will-ing to take all your abuse and insults and insensitivity.' 

GEORGE

WOW! 

KRAMER

(emotionally) She's deep. 

JERRY

(reading on) '...'cause that's what you need to do to prove I'm not going to leave you. I'm sick and tired of running from places and people and relationships. You want me, that fight for me, becau-' 

KRAMER

You know Jerry, she sounds like a poet! 

JERRY

No one's ever written me a letter like this. Maybe I was wrong about her! 

KRAMER

(pushing Jerry towards the phone) Yeah! Get in there and give her a call. Pick up the phone and call her! 

JERRY

Should I? 

KRAMER

(screaming) YES! YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT YOU SHOULD! (hysterically) Fight for her, Jerry, she's sure as hell fighting for you! 

JERRY

ALL RIGHT, all right! I'll call her. 

TO

Jerry's apartment, another day. Jerry is helping Nina put on her coat. The TV is on a horse race.] 

JERRY

SHOT! (the sound of a shot on the TV is heard) I told ya! (the inter- com buzzes) Yeah? 

GEORGE

(on intercom) It's George. 

JERRY

Come on up. (to Nina) Well, now we gotta get a posse together. I love a good posse. 

NINA

What's the appeal of the posse? 

JERRY

The appeal of the posse? The posse has tremendous appeal. Get away from the job, camp out, you're with your friends... Come on, it's a week-long game of hide-and-seek on horseback. 

NINA

Hello, George. 

GEORGE

Hey, Nina! (beat) I owe you some money, don't I? 

NINA

Well, I really love that piece. 

GEORGE

Oh, yeah, me too, me too. Boy oh boy oh boy...! You know, in fact, I've been thinking about it, and I feel like I'm stealing from you! Five-hundred dollars! It's gonna be worth thousands soon! You know what? On second thought, I can't even accept it. 

NINA

No, no no no, George! A deal's a deal. I want you to have it! 

GEORGE

This could be in a museum some day! It's not safe with me! It should really be in a doormanned building. 

NINA

Honestly, George, the money's not important. 

GEORGE

Who said anything about money? (intercom buzzes) 

JERRY

Yeah? 

ELAINE

(on intercom) It's Elaine. 

JERRY

Come on up. 

NINA

Elaine? 

JERRY

...Yeah. 

NINA

(rolling eyes) This person does not believe in telephones, does she? 

JERRY

She likes the pop-in. I've told her how I hate the pop-in. (pointing to George) He likes the pop-in, too. 

GEORGE

I just popped in now. I'm a big pop-in guy. 

JERRY

Yeah. 

GEORGE

How 'bout Kramer. 

JERRY

HUGE pop-in guy! 

NINA

Well, I was leaving anyway, so, uh, we're on for tomorrow? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

NINA

Okay. 

JERRY

Okay! 

NINA

Bye. (just as Nina is about to leave, Elaine walks in.) 

ELAINE

(to Nina) Hello! 

ELAINE

(sarcastic) Chatty gal. (beat) Lippman's coming back tomorrow, I'll be fired! 

JERRY

If he noticed, he would have called you from Houston! 

ELAINE

No, he wants to torture me. 

TO

later on that night. George, Elaine, and Jerry are watching TV.Jerry, with the remote, is furiously flipping through channels.] 

ELAINE

(annoyed) Oh! Would you gimme the clicker? I hate it when you're the clicker! You go too fast! (Elain makes a grab for the clicker, instigating a tug-o-war between Elaine and Jerry over the clicker) 

JERRY

(tugging at the clicker) I'm a great clicker! (gets the clicker back) Great instincts. How dare you impune my clicking. 

ELAINE

You're all over the dial! You don't know what you want! I've never seen you stay on anything for more than 5 seconds. Gimme that. 

JERRY

Let go! 

ELAINE

No, come on! I want it, Jerry! 

JERRY

Let go, Elaine! 

ELAINE

Well at least let George do it! 

JERRY

Oh, George can't click! (George joins in the fight) 

GEORGE

(as Jerry and Elaine continue to whine) Give it! Give it! (he finally gets the remote away from them) Pinheads. 

JERRY

Wait, wait a second! Go back, go back to that. (they watch it a little longer) 

ELAINE

It's Chapter 2, it's Neil Simon. 

JERRY

(on to something) Wait a second... wait a second!! (he watches the TV for another minute) The letter, that's the letter! 

ELAINE

What letter? 

JERRY

This is the letter she wrote to me, she stole it right from the movie! 

JERRY

'...'cause you don't even make the slightest effort to offer happiness still know that I love you!!' 

GEORGE

This is incredible! 

JERRY

I always thought there was something funny about this letter! She copied it right out of Chapter 2! She a thief, a bunko-artist! 

GEORGE

Maybe I won't send her that check. 

ELAINE

You know, it's not really that terrible. 

JERRY

What are you talking about? She completely misrepresented herself! (mimicking the letter) I don't offer happiness. I offer happiness! James Caan doesn't offer happiness! 

TO

Lippman's office. Lippman is on the phone when Elaine walks in and places something on his desk. After she does, she tries to leave but Lippman, still on the phone, motions for her to stay in the room] 

ELAINE

Um, oh, it's Townscend, which is NEAR Baltimore. 

ELAINE

Well, uh, fan. My father-- 

ELAINE

Really? 

ELAINE

So... impudent. 

ELAINE

(pause) Ah. I've-I've got plans, though, Mr. Li-- 

ELAINE

(very reluctant) Okay. 

ELAINE

That will be fun. 

TO

Nina's studio. Nina is working on a painting. Jerry is watching her, sitting on the sofa.] 

JERRY

How's it coming? 

NINA

Good, good. 

JERRY

Seen any good movies lately? 

NINA

No... not really. You? 

JERRY

No. I like a good comedy. You know, like a Neil Simon? You like Neil Simon? 

NINA

Neil Simon? Uh, some of his stuff. 

JERRY

I've seen MOST of it. I guess my favorite would have to be, uh... Chapter 2. Have you ever seen that? 

NINA

I don't know... maybe. 

JERRY

I have. Funny, funny. In fact it was on TV just the other night. Happened to catch it. (a knock is heard at the door) I couldn't help notice a STUNNING similiarity-- (Jerry is interrupted as Nina opens answer the door...) 

TO

Jerry's apartment, night. Jerry and George are watching a baseball game and talking.] 

GEORGE

Five-thousand? Why would anybody buy Kramer for $5000? (laughs) 

JERRY

Boy, the Yankees cannot buy a hit tonight! 

GEORGE

So is it all over between you and... Marsha Mason? 

JERRY

Yeah. (picks up Nina's painting George bought) And by the way, can you get this thing outta my house? 

GEORGE

Tell you what, I'll make a deal with you. I'll sell it to you right now for ten bucks. 

TVVOICE

Uh, there's seems to be a lot of trouble in the area just behind the Yankee dugout. 

GEORGE

Behind the dugout, that's where we were sitting the other day. 

TVVOICE

Well, we're not going to show it, we don't want to encourage that kind of behavior. Say, it's a young lady, and boy she's really going at it with the security guard. She's a fiesty one. And now they're getting the other security guard to come down. How do you like that Seegers? Boy, she's someting. (beat) And a ball to left field...' 

TO

the Armstrong's dining room. Mr. and Mrs. Armstrong are having Kramer over for dinner.] 

KRAMER

...then, when I was seventeen, I ran away from home and hopped a steamship to Sweden. (beat) This steak is excellent, by the way. 

ARM

More potatoes? 

KRAMER

Yeah, sure. Please. 

KRAMER

Yeah. (beat) And, it was a big one. 

KRAMER

Hey. I got some bad news for you, buddy. I think your car got stolen again. 

JERRY

What are you talking about? 

KRAMER

Well you parked it on eighty-fourth and Columbus, right? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

KRAMER

Yep, well I just walked by there and that car is gone. 

JERRY

Oh yeah, I know. 

KRAMER

Well, where is it? 

JERRY

What's the difference? 

KRAMER

Well, there's no difference, you know, I'm just curious. 

JERRY

You always have to know everything that's going on, don't you? 

KRAMER

What happened to the car? 

JERRY

If I don't tell you it will kill you, won't it? 

KRAMER

Yeah, yeah, it'll kill me. 

JERRY

You have to know, you must know. 

KRAMER

I must know. 

JERRY

Well, I'm not telling you. 

KRAMER

Oh, come on. 

JERRY

Nope. I don't think so. 

KRAMER

Well, please? 

JERRY

Not today, pal. 

KRAMER

Okay, I beg you. 

JERRY

Now see? Just saying beg doesn't make it a real beg. You gotta put some beg into it. 

KRAMER

Okay, please! Please tell me! 

JERRY

Alright, I'll tell you, but your begging needs a lot of work. 

KRAMER

Okay, okay, what is it? Come on. 

JERRY

I loaned the car to George. 

KRAMER

Ah, George, alright. Well, what for? 

JERRY

George and Elaine went to a flea market in Westchester, okay?! 

KRAMER

Alright. 

JERRY

Huh? 

KRAMER

Huh. I mean, what do they want to go there for? 

JERRY

Will you stop it already?! 

KRAMER

You know, why didn't they ask me to go? 

JERRY

I don't know! How am I supposed to know?! 

KRAMER

What, they don't like me? 

JERRY

*I* don't like you! 

KRAMER

If they like me, why don't they ask me to go? Oh yeah. 

GEORGE

I really think it looks good. 

ELAINE

Ten bucks, how can you go wrong? 

GEORGE

All bald people look good in hats. 

ELAINE

You should have lived in the twenties and thirties, you know men wore hats all the time then. 

GEORGE

What a bald paradise that must have been. Nobody knew. 

ELAINE

Well, you can wear a hat all the time now. Who's stopping you? 

GEORGE

No, I can't. What if I meet a woman? I'd always be worried about that first moment where I'd take it off and see that look of disappointment on her face. 

ELAINE

Are you sure you like these sunglasses? 

KRAMER

Well I'm very disappointed in George and Elaine. And you know I'm somebody you don't want to have on your bad side. 

JERRY

Why not? 

KRAMER

Because I'm like ice, buddy. When I don't like you, you've got problems. (notices some snacks on the table) Oh, is this for the fight? 

JERRY

Yep. (checks watch) Starts in thirty-five minutes. 

KRAMER

Oh hey, you know I invited Mike Moffit. You don't mind, do you? 

JERRY

No, I like Mike. 

KRAMER

Yeah, I just got off the phone with him, you know we had a great conversation. 

JERRY

Oh yeah? What did you talk about? 

KRAMER

Well actually we talked about you. Yeah. He had some pretty interesting things to say. 

JERRY

Oh yeah? What did he say? 

KRAMER

You have to know everything, don't you? 

JERRY

No, come on, Kramer. What did he say? 

KRAMER

Why is that? Why do you have to know everything? 

JERRY

Kramer, just tell me what the guy said. 

KRAMER

Beg me. 

JERRY

Please, don't make me beg. 

KRAMER

No no no, I want you to beg me. And I don't want you to say it, I just want you to put some beg into it. Go on. 

JERRY

Kramer, please tell me what the guy said. 

KRAMER

No no no, that's no good. No, I really don't think that's a beg. No, it's close, but uh... 

JERRY

Kramer! 

KRAMER

Look, I can't say anything. You know, the guy told me the stuff in confidence, I'd be betraying a friend. 

JERRY

Well you can't just mention it and then not tell me. 

KRAMER

Alright. I'll tell you but you can't say anything to him. 

JERRY

I'm not saying anything, I'm putting it in the vault, I'm locking the vault, it's a vault! 

KRAMER

He thinks you're a phony. 

JERRY

He what? 

KRAMER

I told you, he thinks you're a phony. 

JERRY

A phony? He called me a phony? 

KRAMER

A big phone. A big one. 

JERRY

Why did you tell me that if I can't say anything?! 

KRAMER

You begged me. 

GEORGE

Do you hear that? 

ELAINE

Of course I hear that. 

GEORGE

You had to move the mirror? 

ELAINE

I wanted to check out my sunglasses. 

GEORGE

I went to look in the mirror, it wasn't there. You threw off my equilibrium. 

ELAINE

Oh yeah, blame it on me because you can't drive, George. 

GEORGE

I can't drive? 

ELAINE

Yeah. 

GEORGE

Nobody drives like me. Nobody. I'm doing things in this car, you have no idea they're going on. Wanna see me make a right turn from the left lane? Watch this. 

ELAINE

No, I really don't. 

GEORGE

And I can make a left turn from the right lane too. 

ELAINE

I'm sure you could. 

GEORGE

What are we gonna tell Jerry about the car? 

ELAINE

I don't know. 

GEORGE

Alright, start looking for spaces. 

ELAINE

Oh, you're never gonna find a space on Jerry's block, just put it in a garage. 

GEORGE

Look, I have my system. First I look for the dream spot right in front of the door, then I slowly expand out in concentric circles. 

ELAINE

Oh come on, George, please put it in a garage. I don't want to spend an hour looking for a space. 

GEORGE

I can't park in a garage. 

ELAINE

Why? 

GEORGE

I don't know, I just can't. Nobody in my family can pay for parking, it's a sickness. My father never paid for parking; my mother, my brother, nobody. We can't do it. 

ELAINE

I'll pay for it. 

GEORGE

You don't understand. A garage. I can't even pull in there. It's like going to a prostitute. Why should I pay, when if I apply myself, maybe I could get it for free? (he hears a horn honking) What? What do you want? Go around me, I'm looking for spaces. 

ELAINE

(pointing backwards) Oh George, there's a space right there! 

GEORGE

(putting the car in reverse) Oh beautiful! Look at that, the dream space right in front of Jerry's building. Huh? Dreams can come true, what did I tell you? 

ELAINE

You didn't even have to take it out to dinner. 

GEORGE

Alright, now you're gonna see some parallel parking. (spitting into his hands and rubbing them together) How I wish you could make a living parallel parking. (turning around in his seat) It's all geometry, knowing all the angles, when to make that first turn and then when to swing it back in, that's the key. 

ELAINE

Will you just park it already? 

GEORGE

There's nothing I can even impart to you, that's the sad thing. It's so inborn, I can't pass it on. (begins backing into the space) Look at this guy. Are you crazy, what are you doing?! Hey! Hey, you're stealing my space! 

ELAINE

George, wait, you don't know who this guy is, people kill for a parking space in this city. 

GEORGE

No no no, he's not getting away with this. 

ELAINE

George? 

GEORGE

Hey, what are you doing? 

MIKE

I think I'm parking my car. 

GEORGE

You can't do that, you can't just sneak in from the back like that. 

MIKE

I'm not sneaking. I didn't even know you were parking, you were just sitting there three spaces up. 

GEORGE

Well if you didn't think I was parking, why did you put it in head first? 

MIKE

Well that's the way I park. Anyway, you didn't start backing in until I pulled in. 

GEORGE

I was in the middle of a conversation. 

MIKE

Hey, buddy, what can I tell you? 

GEORGE

The point is I was here first. 

MIKE

I was closer to this space than you were. 

GEORGE

But I'm backing in! You can't put it in head first! 

MIKE

I can if I have room! 

GEORGE

Are you gonna move the car? 

MIKE

No, I'm not gonna move the car. 

GEORGE

Jerk! 

MIKE

Oh, you're not? 

GEORGE

Do you believe this guy? 

ELAINE

Come on, we'll put it in a garage. 

GEORGE

I am not putting it in a garage, it's my space. 

ELAINE

What are you gonna do, you just gonna leave it here like this? Uh. I'm going upstairs. 

GEORGE

Are you coming back down? 

ELAINE

Yeah, I gotta tell Jerry we're here. I gotta go to the bathroom. 

GEORGE

Alright, just make sure he reserves the good chair for me. Wait, what are you gonna tell him about the clanking noise in the car? 

ELAINE

Me? No no no, you. You're gonna tell him. I'm not gonna tell- Noo. 

GEORGE

Oh, come on, you're good at this. 

ELAINE

What am I gonna say? 

GEORGE

I don't know, I don't know, you'll think of something. 

ELAINE

Oh god, I need a drink, do you got any Hennigan's here? 

JERRY

Yeah, under the counter. What happened? 

ELAINE

Oh god. Oh, Jerry it was so terrible what we just went through on the way home. (pouring a big shot of scotch) You wouldn't believe it. (pushing a bag of chips off the counter) 

JERRY

(bending down to pick up the chips) Tell me what happened. 

ELAINE

(after pouring the shot in the sink while Jerry was distracted and pretending to have downed it) Okay. Now listen. We were at the toll booth at the Henry Hudson Parkway, okay?! And there were these, like, this pack of extremely wild teenagers in a convertible behind us, okay?! And for some reason, I don't know, they just started to taunt us! And so then we payed the toll, and then we went through, and then they started to follow us, alright?! So George tries to lose them, and, and, but they were in this really like a souped up car, you know?! And so he turned off the road really suddenly and the car was on two wheels and I was just screaming! And then, George is such a great driver. 

JERRY

He is? 

ELAINE

Oh, he is fantastic! And then they fired a gun right up in the air. 

JERRY

A gun?! 

ELAINE

I think it was a gun. And then they followed us all the way into the city, and then they just stopped and they turned around and they went home. 

JERRY

My god, are you okay? 

ELAINE

Yeah, yeah, I'm alright. Oh, by the way, the car hit a pothole and now it's making a clanking noise. 

JERRY

Well, I mean, as long as you're okay, that, that's the important thing. 

ELAINE

Exactly. 

JERRY

Where's George now? 

ELAINE

Oh, he's out in front of the building. He's arguing with some guy about a parking space. 

JERRY

What are you talking about? 

ELAINE

Look out the window, you'll see. 

JERRY

(leaning out the window) Hey Georgie! 

GEORGE

Hey! 

JERRY

Are you okay? 

GEORGE

Yeah, I'm fine. 

JERRY

Crazy kids, huh? 

GEORGE

What? 

ELAINE

(desperate to distract Jerry) Ow!! (Jerry looks over) It's my cuticle. 

MIKE

Is that Jerry? Jerry?! 

JERRY

Oh, hey Mike. 

GEORGE

What, you know Jerry? 

MIKE

Yeah, I know Jerry. 

GEORGE

How do you know him? 

MIKE

What's the difference? 

GEORGE

Because I know him too, and probably a lot better than you. 

MIKE

Well, bully for you. Hey, Jerry! You know your friend here's a real piece of work! 

JERRY

I'm coming down. 

MIKE

Hey, will you tell Kramer I'm outside? 

GEORGE

What, you know Kramer?! 

ELAINE

Hi. 

KRAMER

(acting standoffish) Hello. 

JERRY

Hey, your friend Mike's outside, he wants to talk to you. 

KRAMER

(out the window) Hey, Mike! Come on up, the fight's almost starting! 

GEORGE

And you're watching the fight at Jerry's? 

MIKE

Yeah. 

GEORGE

Oh great. 

ELAINE

You know that guy downstairs? 

JERRY

Yeah, he's a real phony. 

KRAMER

What's going on?! 

MIKE

Hey, will you come on down? This guy's in my space! 

GEORGE

It's my space! 

KRAMER

I'll be down in a minute. 

ELAINE

Are you going down? 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

ELAINE

Is anything wrong? 

KRAMER

(leaving) Why should anything be wrong? 

ELAINE

(heading for the bathroom) Be down in a minute. 

MIKE

Hey pal, you're not getting that space. I mean, I'll sleep in my car if I have to. 

GEORGE

I'll die out here. 

MIKE

Hey! Jerry! Long time no see! 

JERRY

Hi Mike. (Noticing George's fedora) Indiana. 

MIKE

Hey Krame! You know this guy? 

KRAMER

Yeah, yeah, I know him. 

MIKE

(to Jerry) You're looking tremendous. What are you on some kind of regimen? 

JERRY

Yeah, twenty-five percent bran flakes. The forty percent was too much so I found a store to mix it up special for me, they take it down another fifteen percent. 

MIKE

(laughing way too loud and hard) Ha ha ha ha!!! That's killer! Killer! I love that! Ha ha ha!!! You gotta use that, that's a definite!! Ha ha ha!!! 

GEORGE

Oh, come on. 

MIKE

Hey! Your friend here has some real problems. 

GEORGE

Me? You see what he did here, you see how he tried to sneak into my space? 

MIKE

Hey, just 'cause I went in front first doesn't mean I'm sneaking in. 

GEORGE

You only went in front first 'cause you saw me backing up and you didn't have room to parallel park! 

MIKE

I only went in front first 'cause I could make it in front first and if you pull out I'll show you! 

GEORGE

You've got a prayer. 

KRAMER

I go in front first all the time. 

JERRY

Front first, that's how you park when you're pulling a bank job. 

GEORGE

Did you talk to him? 

ELAINE

Yeah, it's all taken care of. 

GEORGE

You told him? What did you tell him? 

ELAINE

I did a number on him, it was a thing of beauty, you really had to have been there to appreciate it. 

GEORGE

I don't believe it, what did you say? 

ELAINE

I told him a pack of teenagers in a convertible were terrorizing us and they followed us into the city. 

GEORGE

A pack of teenagers? 

ELAINE

Yeah, by the time I got to the end of the story, he was to relieved that we were alive he couldn't care less about the car. 

GEORGE

You are a genius, it's as simple as that. 

ELAINE

What can I say, you know? It's a gift. I only wish I could teach it but, you know it's inborn. 

KRAMER

By the way, thanks a lot for inviting me to the flea market. 

ELAINE

What? 

KRAMER

Yeah, Jerry, he told me all about it. 

GEORGE

Oh great. 

JERRY

I didn't know. 

ELAINE

Oh, so that's why you were acting so funny. 

GEORGE

Well I didn't know you wanted to go to the flea market. 

MIKE

A flea market? You went to a flea market?? 

GEORGE

Hey, who's talking to you? 

ELAINE

We just didn't think of you. 

KRAMER

You said it, sister. 

GEORGE

What? Every time I leave my house now I have to call everybody I know and ask them if they want to do what I'm doing? 

GEORGE

Great move, telling him, by the way, real smart move. 

JERRY

I didn't know I wasn't supposed to say anything! 

GEORGE

Judgement, Jerry, judgement! You exercised no judgement. 

JERRY

You're right. My fault. 

ELAINE

Kramer? I'm so sorry, really. 

GEORGE

Yeah, I'm sorry. 

KRAMER

I'm sorry, I don't care for that sorry. 

GEORGE

What was wrong with that sorry? It was a good sorry. Jerry, was that a good sorry? 

JERRY

It was a so-so sorry. 

DRIVER

Hey! Move this car, I gotta get through! 

GEORGE

You heard the man. I guess you gotta be moving your car. 

MIKE

And like you're not gonna just back it in if I do that? 

DRIVER

Well somebody better move something soon! I got a truck full of ice cream here! 

ELAINE

You see, they had to move the cars so the truck could get through, right? But these guys don't trust each other so they got these two nonpartisan drivers to move them. 

JERRY

Wild pack of teenagers, huh? 

GEORGE

Yeah. 

JERRY

Amazing how they picked you, out of everyone, to terrorize. 

ELAINE

Yeah. I know, I said to myself, 'Why us?' You remember? 

GEORGE

Uh huh. 

JERRY

Sounds like you did some pretty nifty maneuvering, 

GEORGE

Well, you know, It's interesting, you know, under that pressure, what you're capable of. 

ELAINE

Right. 

GEORGE

I learned a lot about myself. 

JERRY

What did you do to my car?! 

GEORGE

I couldn't help it! Elaine moved the mirror, I got discombobulated. 

ELAINE

Oh, like you've ever been bobulated. 

JERRY

I thought you said you were a good driver! 

GEORGE

No no, I never said I was a good driver, I said I was a good parker. 

JERRY

I think you said driver. 

GEORGE

Parker, I never said driver, I said parker, a great parker. 

MIKE

Will you move it up a little bit? 

GEORGE

No no no, that's in the right position. 

MIKE

No no, I was further in. 

GEORGE

No you weren't. Stop there, that's fine. 

MIKE

Do you mind? 

GEORGE

Do you? 

SID

Hey, somebody better move these cars, you're making a commotion. 

JERRY

Hey Sid. 

MIKE

Who are you? 

SID

Never mind who I am. I know who I am. Do you know who you are? (to George) Why is it every time you park a car in this block, everything gets disrupted and disjointed? 

GEORGE

Sid, it's completely his fault. 

MIKE

Oh, right. 

SID

Why don't you start taking the bus? 

JERRY

Okay, George. Come on, let's go. I'm putting it in a garage. The fight's starting in two minutes. 

GEORGE

Don't do it! 

JERRY

What are we gonna do, stay out here all night? 

GEORGE

Yes! I'm not giving him the satisfaction, it's my space. 

ELAINE

Why don't you just flip a coin already? 

GEORGE

No no, this is a matter of principle. That would just be saying that anybody could just pull into any parking space any way they want. Well I'm making a stand here. I'm saying *no* to head first parking. I'm not putting up with that. We put up with too much crap in this city, we're not putting up with head first parking. 

ELAINE

You know, maybe if you hadn't been sitting there pontificating about what a great parker you were, you might have got the space. 

GEORGE

So you're against me now? 

MAN

He could have pulled up to the car and backed in, but he chose to go in head first. 

MATTHEW

No he couldn't, because the other car was already backing in. 

MAN

No he wasn't. 

MATTHEW

All that matters is who was there first. 

MAN

Ahh, you're not even old enough to drive, you little puke. 

MATTHEW

You just spit on me! 

MAN

Don't you raise your voice to me! 

MATTHEW

You're not my father. 

JERRY

Hey Matthew. 

MATTHEW

Hi Jerry. This guy's really a jerk. 

JERRY

How ya doing? 

MATTHEW

Okay. 

JERRY

Hey, how's your father? I hear he's closing his store. 

MATTHEW

What?! 

JERRY

Oh no, nothing. 

MATTHEW

What's happened to daddy? He's going out of business? 

JERRY

No, no, no, no. 

MATTHEW

We're not going to have any money? We're out of money? 

JERRY

No, of course not, of course not! 

MATTHEW

Mommy!? Jerry says daddy's closing the store. He's going out of business. We don't have any money? 

MARYEDITH

Jerry?! What's the matter with you? 

JERRY

I didn't-- 

MARYEDITH

(to Kramer) Boy, I don't know about your friend, Jerry. He says some pretty stupid things sometimes. 

KRAMER

Oh, congratulations. 

MARYEDITH

What for? 

KRAMER

Well, you're pregnant. 

MARYEDITH

What? 

KRAMER

You're not pregnant? 

MARYEDITH

No, I'm not pregnant. 

KRAMER

Are you sure you're not pregnant? 

MARYEDITH

Yes, I'm sure! 

KRAMER

That's weird. 

MARYEDITH

Come on, Matthew. 

MATTHEW

No. 

MARYEDITH

Come on, Matthew! 

KRAMER

I thought she was pregnant. 

JERRY

(to Elaine) Hey, do you think I'm phony? 

ELAINE

What? 

JERRY

Mike thinks I'm a phony. 

ELAINE

He thinks you're a phony? 

JERRY

Yeah, but I can't say anything because Kramer wasn't supposed to tell me. 

ELAINE

Oh, you have to say something. 

JERRY

I can't, I told Kramer I was vaulting it. 

ELAINE

You gotta open the vault. 

JERRY

Open my vault? 

ELAINE

Open your vault. 

JERRY

Once I open the vault, it ceases to be a vault. 

ELAINE

You have no choice. 

JERRY

Oy ga-vault. 

KRAMER

When can you park head first? 

NEWMAN

Never. 

MIKE

What are you asking this guy for? 

NEWMAN

Who's talking to you? 

GEORGE

He's right. never. 

MIKE

Oh yeah? What if you got ten car lengths? You have to pull all the way up to the front car? 

NEWMAN

Well, I suppose if you got ten car lengths. 

GEORGE

When do you ever have ten car lengths? 

KRAMER

What about Sundays and holidays? 

GEORGE

Oh please. 

SHEILA

What's going on here? 

GEORGE

Oh, this guy tried to sneak into my space. 

SHEILA

I really hate people who do that. I hope you don't let him get away with it. 

GEORGE

Well, thank you for your support. 

SHEILA

Hey, that's a great hat. 

GEORGE

Really? You like it? I got it at a flea market today. 

NEWMAN

Hey George, nice hat. 

GEORGE

Yeah, thanks. 

NEWMAN

Can I try it on? 

GEORGE

No! It, uh, it wouldn't fit you. 

NEWMAN

Well sure it would. 

GEORGE

No! Get out of here, Newman. 

NEWMAN

Come on, let me try it on. 

GEORGE

No, Newman, stop it. 

SHEILA

Let him try it on. 

GEORGE

I don't want him to! 

SHEILA

What is wrong with you? 

GEORGE

You wanna see?! (pulling off the hat to reveal the bald pate) There! There it is! (turning to Newman) Alright, here! You wanna try on the hat?! Here! Try on the hat! 

NEWMAN

Stop it, George, stop it. I was defending your parking. 

GEORGE

Alright, just keep the hat! 

JERRY

Alright, that's it. The fight's already started. I'm going upstairs, who's coming? Elaine? 

ELAINE

It depends on who's going. (to George) Are you going? 

KRAMER

I'm not going if he's going. 

NEWMAN

Me either. 

GEORGE

I'm not going if he's going. 

MIKE

Well I'm going. 

JERRY

Well if he's going then I'm not going. 

NEWMAN

But it's your house. 

JERRY

I still don't have to go. 

ELAINE

Well I don't want to go if Jerry's not going. 

MIKE

Why won't you go if I go? 

JERRY

Why? I'll tell you why. 

KRAMER

No. Don't, Jerry. 

JERRY

Like you didn't call me a phony? 

MIKE

What? (to Kramer) Thanks! Real good! Jerry! First of all, I think you completely misunderstood what I said. I meant it in a complementary way. I mean, you know when people say, 'He's bad', it really means he's good, sort of thing? You know, slang. 

JERRY

Use it in a sentence. 

MIKE

Man, that Michael Jordan is so phony. (to Kramer) Why'd you tell him?!? 

KRAMER

He begged me. 

MIKE

He begged you?! 

JERRY

Alright, come on. Who wants to watch the fight? 

GEORGE

Officer, could I just explain something to you? 

GEORGE

Officer, he can't pull in head first. 

MIKE

Officer, he backed up from down the street. He was double-parked, he was 

GEORGE

Well, you're gonna have to go to the bathroom! 

MIKE

Well, you're gonna have to go to work! 

GEORGE

I don't have a job! 

MIKE

Neither do I! 

REFEREE

Seven... Eight... Nine... Ten. *ding* 

JERRY

Kramer, what are you doing here!? 

KRAMER

Jerry, now calm down, it's okay. I'm sorry. I didn't want to wake you up! Y'know, I was watching 'Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo,' and I - y'know, I wanted to get some popcorn, and I, uh...I used the spare keys that you gave me to come into your apartment to get your popper. 

JERRY

You scared me! 

KRAMER

It's just me. 

JERRY

That's enough! 

KRAMER

Forgot the popper... (goes to the kitchen, grabs the popper, drops the lid, juggles it around, then exits.) 

JERRY

C'mon...c'mon... 

JERRY

Kramer! What are you doing?! 

KRAMER

What does it look like I'm doing? What? 

JERRY

Get out! Get out of the bathroom, I gotta go! 

KRAMER

Alright, alright... 

JERRY

C'mon! 

KRAMER

Sorry. 

JERRY

Move it! Move it! Get going! 

KRAMER

My drain's all clogged up! (Comes out of the bathroom in a towel, covered in soap suds.) 

JERRY

Is that my towel? 

GIRLFRIEND

I'm really happy the movie was sold out. 

JERRY

Hey, did you ever pretend there's like, murderers chasing you, and you try and see how fast you can get your keys out and get into your apartment? 

GIRLFRIEND

I'm from Witchita, so... 

JERRY

Oh. I see. There he is! (Pretends the murderers are coming.) 

GIRLFRIEND

Hurry, Jerry! He's coming! Hurry! 

JERRY

The murderers! (Jerry unlocks his door and they both run inside.) 

GIRLFRIEND

That was close! 

JERRY

Did you see the look on that guy's face? 

GIRLFRIEND

You were so fast with those keys. (They prepare to kiss, but are interrupted by Kramer and his girlfriend coming out of Jerry's bedroom, laughing and horsing around.) 

JERRY

Kramer! What the hell are you doing here?! 

KRAMER

Hey, Jerry! How are ya? I thought you were going to the movies. 

JERRY

All right, that's it. Hand 'em over. 

KRAMER

What? 

JERRY

What, you know what, the keys. I want the keys. You've lost your key privileges. 

KRAMER

Oh, come on! 

JERRY

No, come on! 

KRAMER

What, what, I thought you went to the movies! 

JERRY

It was sold out! 

KRAMER

Now how was I supposed to know it was going to be sold out? 

JERRY

That's the point. 

KRAMER

What point? 

JERRY

Just, look, just give the keys. 

KRAMER

Just give me another chance! 

JERRY

Don't ask me! 

KRAMER

I'm asking you! 

JERRY

I'm telling you. 

KRAMER

You're joking. 

JERRY

I'm serious! 

KRAMER

It's not going to happen again! 

JERRY

Yes it will, now give me those keys! 

KRAMER

O.K., fine, go ahead, you take the keys! But you're going to regret this. (He angrily storms out. Kramer then re-enters seconds later when he realizes he's left his girlfriend in Jerry's apartment.) 

JERRY

So put 'em in a safe place. 

ELAINE

I will. 

JERRY

Where? 

ELAINE

I don't know. I'll hide 'em. So, is Kramer upset? 

JERRY

I think so. I mean, he's acting really weird lately...he's different. 

ELAINE

Well, maybe you should just give him the keys back. 

JERRY

I can't. 

ELAINE

Is that Kramer? (Jerry nods.) 

JERRY

Who's there? 

KRAMER

Uh, Kramer. (Jerry opens the door, Kramer enters. Elaine waves at Kramer with the keys in her hand.) Oh, hi...uh...you got the... 

ELAINE

Oh, I'm not, uh... 

KRAMER

No, no, no, it's o.k. I don't care about the keys. It's my fault. I gave the keys away with my stupidity. I broke 'the covenant of the keys.' 

ELAINE

Jerry, give him the keys back. 

JERRY

Elaine... 

KRAMER

I don't want the keys back! No, I'm glad the way things turned out. I was clingin' to those keys, man! Like a branch on the banks of a raging river. And now I have let go. And I'm free...to go with the current. To float. (To Jerry) And I thank you. 

JERRY

Take the keys. 

KRAMER

I don't want the keys! (Jerry tries to force the keys on Kramer, but Kramer refuses.) 

JERRY

O.K.! 

KRAMER

Now, one more thing - I would like my keys back. 

JERRY

Your spare set? 

KRAMER

That's right. 

JERRY

You want 'em back? 

KRAMER

Yeah. Yeah, I think it would be for the best. 

GEORGE

Gee, Kramer, I uh...I don't know what to say. 

KRAMER

Say yes! Yes, George. Yes! 

GEORGE

Should I give you my keys, is that the transaction, trading keys...? Because Elaine has my keys. 

KRAMER

Well, you can get 'em back. 

GEORGE

I suppose I could. 

KRAMER

Because you see, George, having the keys to Jerry's apartment? That kept me in a fantasy world. Every time I went over to his house, it was like I was on vacation. Better food, better view, better TV. And cleaner? Oh - much cleaner. That became my reality. I ignored the squalor in my own life because I'm looking at life, you see, through Jerry's eyes. I was living in twilight, George. Living in the shadows. Living in the darkness...like you. 

GEORGE

Me? 

KRAMER

Oh, yeah. I can barely see you, George. 

GEORGE

Alright, stop it Kramer, you're freakin' me out. (The waitress comes over.) 

WAITRESS

Hi, are you ready to order? (George tries to order, but Kramer interrupts.) 

KRAMER

Do you ever yearn? 

GEORGE

Yearn? Do I yearn? 

KRAMER

I yearn. 

GEORGE

You yearn. 

KRAMER

Oh, yes. Yes, I yearn. Often, I...I sit...and yearn. Have you yearned? 

GEORGE

Well, not recently. I craved. I crave all the time, constant craving...but I haven't yearned. 

KRAMER

Look at you. 

GEORGE

Aw, Kramer, don't start... 

KRAMER

You're wasting your life. 

GEORGE

I am not! What you call wasting, I call living! I'm living my life! 

KRAMER

O.K., like what? No, tell me! Do you have a job? 

GEORGE

No. 

KRAMER

You got money? 

GEORGE

No. 

KRAMER

Do you have a woman? 

GEORGE

No. 

KRAMER

Do you have any prospects? 

GEORGE

No. 

KRAMER

You got anything on the horizon? 

GEORGE

Uh...no. 

KRAMER

Do you have any action at all? 

GEORGE

No. 

KRAMER

Do you have any conceivable reason for even getting up in the morning? 

GEORGE

I like to get the Daily News! 

KRAMER

George, it's time for us to grow up - and be men. Not little boys. 

GEORGE

Why? 

KRAMER

I'm goin' to California. You know, I got the bug. 

GEORGE

Yeah, I think I got a touch of something, too. 

KRAMER

No, the acting bug. Ever since I was in that Woody Allen movie. 

GEORGE

'These pretzels are making me thirsty'? That was one line! You got fired! 

KRAMER

I know, I know, but man! I never felt so alive! Now, are you coming with me? 

GEORGE

Uh, no, I'm not. 

KRAMER

Alright, suit yourself. But let's keep this between us - we're key brothers now. (Gets up to leave.) 

GEORGE

You're not really gonna go to California, are you? 

KRAMER

Up here, I'm already gone. (Kramer exits.) 

GEORGE

Anyway, so he gave me his spare keys, now he wants to have my keys, so I need mine back from you. 

ELAINE

Just 'cause you have his keys? Why does he need yours? 

GEORGE

I don't know. He said he wants to be my 'key brother.' 

ELAINE

That's ridiculous. 

GEORGE

That's Kramer. 

ELAINE

I'll give you back your spare keys - but now I want mine back. 

GEORGE

What for? 

ELAINE

'Cause. I'll give 'em to Jerry. 

GEORGE

Jerry? Why? 

ELAINE

'Cause he gave me his. 

GEORGE

So what? 

ELAINE

So, if he has my keys, I should have his. 

GEORGE

Well, I don't see why if you have his, he should have yours. 

ELAINE

I just said the same thing to you. 

GEORGE

What? 

ELAINE

What? 

GEORGE

Alright, listen, I'll give you your spare keys, but I don't have them with me. Can I please have mine to give to back to Kramer? 

ELAINE

Yeah, O.K. I'll go get 'em. (George begins to leaf through papers on Elaine's counter.) What are you doing? Would you just put that down? (Takes the papers away from George.) I gotta get some new friends. 

JERRY

Did you bring the keys? 

GEORGE

Yes, but I still don't feel right about letting you into Kramer's apartment without his permission. 

JERRY

This could be an emergency! 

GEORGE

You never should have taken away his keys! 

JERRY

I tried to give 'em back, he wouldn't take 'em. (Jerry and George go out into the hallway to Kramer's apartment.) 

GEORGE

How'd the Mets do? 

JERRY

They lost. 

JERRY

Kramer? 

NEWMAN

Hello, boys. 

JERRY

Hello, Newman. 

NEWMAN

You lookin' for someone? 

JERRY

Don't play coy with me, Newman, I'm not in the mood! 

NEWMAN

Coy? I'm not being coy. 

JERRY

Is he being coy? 

GEORGE

Yeah, coy. 

JERRY

You're being coy. Now where's Kramer, Newman? 

NEWMAN

Who? 

JERRY

Listen, Tiny. I wanna know where Kramer is and wanna know now! 

NEWMAN

Alright, go ahead and hit me, Seinfeld. I got witnesses. 

JERRY

Turn around, George. 

GEORGE

Sure. (Turns around.) 

NEWMAN

George? 

JERRY

Now, you better tell me where Kramer is, or are we gonna have to do this the hard way? (Hits wall with his fist.) 

NEWMAN

Help! Help! 

JERRY

Where's Kramer? 

NEWMAN

HELP! (Elaine enters.) 

ELAINE

What's going on? 

NEWMAN

They're gonna beat me up! 

GEORGE

No we're not. 

JERRY

We're trying to find out what happened to Kramer. 

NEWMAN

You wanna know what happened to Kramer? I'll tell you what happened to Kramer. He was ticked off. About the keys. Yeah, that's right - about the keys. Thought he got a bad rap. 

JERRY

Bad rap? 

NEWMAN

Yeah. From you. 

JERRY

Me? 

NEWMAN

You heard me. So he packed it up and split for the coast. La-La Land. L.A. 

JERRY

L.A.? 

JERRY

I never should have taken his keys away. But he drove me to it! I had no choice! He wouldn't take 'em back. Elaine, you saw it, remember? I said, 'Take the keys back.' He wouldn't do anything. You saw it, didn't you see it? 

ELAINE

Yeah, yeah, I saw it. (mutters under her breath) I mean, it's complete bullshit. 

JERRY

Huh? 

ELAINE

What...? 

JERRY

No, what'd you say? 

ELAINE

Nothing. I didn't say anything. 

JERRY

Oh, you didn't see it. 

ELAINE

Yeah, I saw it. I saw it! I did, I saw it. Yep. 

JERRY

I heard you say something, there. 

ELAINE

I didn't say anything. 

JERRY

I'm calling Kramer's mother. (Picks up the phone, dials.) (To Elaine) I don't know what you said. But it was something. I heard something. Hello? Hello, Mrs. Kramer? Mrs. Kramer? Could you turn the music down? Could you turn the music down! 

GEORGE

Ask her about Kramer. 

JERRY

She's drunk out of her mind. 

JERRY

Elaine? Are you there? It's me, I'm locked out of my apartment, I need my spare keys. Where are you? I'm at the coffee shop. 

KRAMER

Hey! You ever been in an accident? 

BIKER

About five years ago. I was going down this very road. Same time of day, going about the same speed I'm going now...there was a rock in the road. Couldn't have been more than a pebble. Never really saw it! Lost control of the bike, went flyin' about a hundred feet - came down right on my head. Cracked it wide open! Blood and stuff was just splattered all over the road, there...I broke every bone in my face. Hey, you know, when they found me, my eyes were hanging out of their sockets? Yeah, they pronounced me dead at the scene. I was in a coma for...well, they told me about a year...said I'd be a vegetable for life. Yeah, but I showed 'em. Ever since then I always wear a helmet! (The biker goes into a turn.) Lean! (Kramer yells.) 

JERRY

Georgie Boy! Way to come through with the keys! Sit down, I'm buying you dinner. 

GEORGE

Look, I gotta tell ya...I been thinkin' about it, I just don't feel right about letting you into Elaine's apartment. 

JERRY

Don't feel right? What are you talking about? 

GEORGE

Well, you know, I shouldn't have let you into Kramer's, now you want to go into Elaine's...she entrusted me with her spare keys, how can I just let you in? 

JERRY

What is the big deal? 

GEORGE

Just because you have someone's spare keys, it doesn't entitle you to break into their apartment. That's the reason you took away Kramer's keys. 

JERRY

First of all, you're not even supposed to have Elaine's keys. You're supposed to give 'em back to her, so she can give 'em back to me, because she has mine. So technically, those are my keys. 

GEORGE

Yes, well, if you had never taken your keys back from Kramer, he never would have taken his back from you and given 'em to me, in which case I wouldn't have had to take mine back from her. 

JERRY

Well, I want those keys. (Tries to grab the keys from George.) 

GEORGE

Nope, no can do. 

JERRY

George, give them to me, I want these keys. (They struggle over the keys.) I don't want to get physical! 

GEORGE

Do you wanna fight? 

JERRY

Do you wanna fight? 

GEORGE

I'll fight ya! Not the face! Not the face! (The struggle continues.) 

KRAMER

And then, the evil ogre took back the magical keys from the handsome young prince. 

KRAMER

Yes! And then the handsome young prince was cast out into the cruel, cruel world. 

KRAMER

Oh, he's cold. 

KRAMER

Yeah, yeah...that'd be funny. (To driver) Hey, you can drop me here! 

KRAMER

Well, you know, I gotta be goin' now. 

KRAMER

What do you think, junior? You think these hands have been soakin' in Ivory liquid? (mimics choking somebody) 

JERRY

Don't you see? You're just avoiding the middle man. You were gonna give her her spare keys, so she was gonna give 'em to me. So, all that's happening is that instead of giving them to her, you're giving them to me. It's just unfortunate that when she gave you yours, you didn't give her hers. 'Cause then she would have given 'em to me, because she has mine. So then I would have never had to ask you for hers, so that I could get mine. 

GEORGE

You're right, how did I miss that? (Begins unlocking the door, mutters under his breath) Maybe because it's a crock of shit. 

JERRY

What's that? 

GEORGE

Nothing. 

JERRY

I heard something. 

GEORGE

Didn't say anything. (They go into Elaine's apartment.) 

KRAMER

So, how long you been drivin' this thing? 

WOMAN

Goin' on four years. 

KRAMER

Well, nothin's sexier than a woman behind the wheel of a semi. 

WOMAN

Nothin'? (They exchange a glance, then laugh.) Listen to you, you're quite the sweet-talker. 

KRAMER

You know, I always wanted to drive the big rigs. I used to watch those commercials during the reruns of Gomer Pyle. 

WOMAN

You want to give it a try? 

KRAMER

Really? 

WOMAN

Do you know how to double-clutch? 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

WOMAN

Well, come on! (They trade places and Kramer gets behind the wheel. Kramer turns out to be really rusty on the ol' double-clutch.) 

GEORGE

They were in here, I saw her put 'em in here! 

JERRY

Well, this is great. 

GEORGE

Well, what do they look like? 

JERRY

They look like keys, George. They look exactly like keys. (In disgust) 'What do they look like.' 

GEORGE

Well, they're obviously not here. 

JERRY

Well, they've gotta be here somewhere. 

GEORGE

Jerry, unless I pull down on this statuette and a hidden wall opens up, we have checked every square inch of this apartment! 

JERRY

What is this? 'Murphy Brown'? 

GEORGE

What? 

JERRY

By Elaine Benes? 

GEORGE

What? 

JERRY

Elaine's writing a 'Murphy Brown'? 

GEORGE

Lemme see this. (Tries to grab the papers.) 

JERRY

Wait a second! (They fight over the paper.) 

GEORGE

Gimme half! 

JERRY

All right, here! 

GEORGE

Why didn't she tell us? 

JERRY

Elaine is writing a sitcom...! (Elaine enters the room behind Jerry and George. Jerry spots her and tosses his half of the script at George. George throws it back and paper goes flying everywhere.) 

ELAINE

You weasels! 

JERRY

What? What? 

ELAINE

How dare you! 

GEORGE

We hardly read anything! 

JERRY

It was funny! 

ELAINE

Who gave you permission to come into my house and just go through all my things? You thought it was funny? 

JERRY

Well... (picks up some of the pages) From what I saw... 

ELAINE

Well, it's just a first draft! 

JERRY

I was locked out of my apartment, I'm just trying to get my keys. 

ELAINE

Why did you let him in?! (Shoves George.) 

GEORGE

He forced me to! 

JERRY

I did not! 

GEORGE

Yes you did! 

ELAINE

You! Get out! Get out! Get out! 

JERRY

Elaine, wait! I need my spare keys! 

ELAINE

Here! Here's your damn keys, you keep 'em! I don't want 'em anymore! 

JERRY

Good! 

ELAINE

And I want my keys back from you! 

GEORGE

What, you don't want me to hold your keys? 

ELAINE

No, you can't be trusted! 

GEORGE

Alright, alright, fine. (Gives the keys to Elaine.) 

JERRY

And I don't want you to hold mine! 

ELAINE

Good! I won't! 

JERRY

Good! Don't! Are these my keys? 

ELAINE

These aren't my keys! 

GEORGE

Whose are these? 

ELAINE

I don't know! 

ELAINE

I just thought I could write it. 

JERRY

Is that something you want to do? 

ELAINE

I don't know. Those writers make a lot of money. 

JERRY

Elaine, let me tell you something about show business. It's hard work! You don't just write a 'Murphy Brown.' You gotta watch the show, study it, get a sense of the characters, how they relate to each other. 

ELAINE

O.K., can I just watch the show? (mutters under her breath) God, what an asshole. 

JERRY

What did you say? 

ELAINE

I didn't say anything. 

JERRY

I heard something. (Looks at the TV) Elaine, Elaine! It's Kramer! Kramer's on 'Murphy Brown'! 

ELAINE

Kramer's on 'Murphy Brown'! 

JERRY

Look, there he is, he's sittin' at the desk! 

BERGEN

Hi, I'm Murphy Brown, you must be my new secretary. 

KRAMER

Oh, good morning, Miss Brown. 

BERGEN

And you are...? 

KRAMER

Oh, I'm uh, Steven Snell. 

BERGEN

Snell. Well, hello, Mr. Snell. 

KRAMER

Steven. 

BERGEN

Steven. Are you familiar with this computer system? 

KRAMER

Oh - I'm familiar with it. 

BERGEN

Steven Snell? I know people...and I have a very good feeling about you. (exits.) 

GEORGE

Kramer was on Murphy Brown? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

GEORGE

Are you sure? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

GEORGE

Murphy Brown, the TV show. 

JERRY

C'mon, will ya? 

GEORGE

Kramer was on Murphy Brown? That son of a gun! 

JERRY

Something, isn't it? 

GEORGE

With Candace Bergen! 

JERRY

I know! 

GEORGE

I've always liked her. Remember her in 'Carnal Knowledge'? 

JERRY

Sure. 

GEORGE

Did she show her breasts in that? 

JERRY

She's not really the naked type. 

GEORGE

I can't believe I missed Kramer. You know he asked me to go with him to California. 

JERRY

He did? 

GEORGE

Yeah, I turned him down. 

JERRY

How come you didn't tell me? 

GEORGE

He asked me to keep it a secret. 

JERRY

But you can never keep a secret. 

GEORGE

I know. This was like a record. My previous record was when Joni Hirsch asked me not to tell anybody that we slept together. Kept a lid on that for about 28 seconds. 

JERRY

Well, you've come a long way. 

GEORGE

I've matured. 

JERRY

Hey listen, the Tonight Show called me, they want me to come out and do the show on the 28th and they're giving me two free tickets to LA. You wanna go? 

GEORGE

A free ticket? 

JERRY

Yeah, in fact we could track down Kramer. I always felt bad about the way he left, you know? That was a mess. I never should have taken back those keys. 

GEORGE

What about accommodations? 

JERRY

All taken care of. 

GEORGE

Is there a meal allowance? What about seat assignments? Could I have the Kosher meal? I hear the Kosher meal is good. And I need clothes. Gotta get a haircut. Gonna have to, I have to refill my allergy medication. Oh, do I need a hat? I need a hat, don't I? Could we do the Universal tour? They have that Backdraft exhibit now, that looks very cool to me... 

KRAMER

So my acting technique, my personal acting technique is working with color, imagining color, then finding the emotional vibrational mood connected to the color. See, if you look through my scripts, you'll see that all my lines have a special color, so I don't memorize language, I memorize color. This way I can go through red, yellow, green, blue. And I have a full palette of emotions. 

GUARD

Hey, didn't I tell you to get out of here? 

KRAMER

Uh, did you? 

GUARD

C'mon, let's go. 

KRAMER

Well, I was just-- 

GUARD

Yeah yeah, you were just nothing. C'mon, let's go. 

KRAMER

Alright, we'll talk about this a little later. Are you an actor? 

VOICE

Murphy Brown. 

KRAMER

Uh, yeah, uh, Candace Bergen please. 

VOICE

Who's calling please? 

KRAMER

Ah, well, just tell her that it's Kramer. 

KRAMER

Alright I'll uh, I'll call her at home. (To man waiting behind him) Go ahead, it's all yours. 

HELENA

Hello Kramer. 

KRAMER

Oh, uh, Helena, how are you? 

HELENA

I haven't worked since 1934, how do you think I am? 

KRAMER

Well, that's only uh, 58 years. 

HELENA

It was a Three Stooges short, 'Sappy Pappy.' I played Mr. Sugarman's secretary, remember? 

KRAMER

Yeah, right, right, yeah, yeah, that was a Shemp, right? 

HELENA

No, a Curly. The boys played three sailors who find a baby, the baby's been kidnapped and the police think that they did it. 

KRAMER

Uh huh, right. 

HELENA

But, but of course they didn't do it, the police had made an awful mistake. 

KRAMER

Right. 

HELENA

Moe hits Curly with an axe, 

KRAMER

Uh huh. 

HELENA

The Stooges catch the kidnappers, 

KRAMER

Right. 

HELENA

But it's too late. 

KRAMER

Really. 

HELENA

The baby's dead. 

KRAMER

Really? 

HELENA

The boys are sent to Death Row and are executed. 

KRAMER

Well I don't remember that part. 

HELENA

I play Mr. Sugarman's secretary. 

KRAMER

Oh, yeah, yeah, you were, you were very good. 

HELENA

Yeah, it was sad for a Three Stooges, what with the dead baby and the Stooges being executed and all. 

KRAMER

Well, that was an unusual choice for the stooges. 

HELENA

Would you like to buy me a fat-free frozen yogurt at the store, Kramer? 

KRAMER

Uh, well, uh, you know I can't right now, you know, uh, I got a very big meeting, I got these people interested in my movie treatment. So, uh, I guess we'll have to make it another time, alright? 

HELENA

Well No! No, don't go out there, Kramer, they'll hurt you, they'll destroy you. You'll never make it in this town, you're too sensitive like me, 

KRAMER

Helena, you're wrong, you know I'm not that sensitive at all. 

HELENA

I was engaged to Mickey Rooney! He left me at the altar. Kramer! Kramer! 

JERRY

What is this? 

GEORGE

What? 

JERRY

We're going on a two day trip, what are you, Diana Ross? 

GEORGE

I happen to dress based on mood. 

JERRY

Oh. But you essentially wear the same thing all the time. 

GEORGE

Seemingly. Seemingly. But within that basic framework there are many subtle variations, only discernable to an acute observer, that reflect the many moods, the many shades, the many sides of George Costanza. 

JERRY

(referring to George's outfit): And what mood is this. 

GEORGE

This is Morning Mist. 

JERRY

Look at this guy, he's like a cat burglar. He thinks if he goes through real slow the machine won't detect him. 

GEORGE

Personally I'm a little nervous about going through these things. I'm afraid I'm gonna step through into another dimension. 

JERRY

Just go. 

GEORGE

Heh he, I made it. 

GUARD

Empty your pockets please. 

GUARD

Walk through again please. 

GUARD

Are you sure you don't have any metal on you? Bracelets? Rings? Anklets? 

JERRY

Anklets? 

GUARD

A lot of men wear anklets. 

JERRY

Really? 

GUARD

Yeah. 

GUARD

What do you have in your bag, sir? 

GEORGE

My bag? 

GUARD

Step over here please. 

JERRY

Over here? 

GUARD

Do you have a knife in the bag? 

GEORGE

A knife? 

GUARD

Open the bag, please. 

GUARD

What's this? 

GEORGE

Moisturizer? 

GUARD

For your wife? 

GEORGE

No, I uh... I use it. 

GUARD

Spread your arms and legs please. 

JERRY

(facing the lengthening line behind him) Ladies and gentlemen, I implore you. 

GUARD

Have a good trip. 

GUARD

Alright, go ahead. 

JERRY

That's it? 

GUARD

That's it. 

JERRY

Alright. 

GEORGE

C'mon Jerry, let's go. What was that all about? 

JERRY

I must have iron rich blood. 

GEORGE

Here we go, LA. 

JERRY

The Coast, 

GEORGE

La-la Land. I got the window seat, right? 

JERRY

Who said that? 

GEORGE

I called it. 

JERRY

Oh no. 

GEORGE

What do you mean, oh no. 

KRAMER

Oh ah, yeah, I'm here for the audition. 

RECEPTIONIST

Which audition, the music video, the horror movie, the exercise tape or the infomercial? 

KRAMER

Uh, let's see... well. 

KRAMER

You scream good. 

CHELSEA

You too. 

CHELSEA

So, can I keep this treatment? 

KRAMER

Oh yeah, yeah, I got 20 copies. 

CHELSEA

'Cause I can, uh, show it to my manager. He has connections with West German television money. 

KRAMER

Really. 

CHELSEA

Yeah, they're trying to put together a miniseries for me on Eva Braun. I mean think about it, is that a great idea? We know nothing about Eva Braun, only that she was Hitler's girlfriend. 

KRAMER

Um-hm. 

CHELSEA

What was it like having sex with Adolf Hitler? What do you wear in a bunker? What did her parents think of Hitler as a potential son-in-law? I mean it could just go on and on... 

KRAMER

Wait wait, hold it, hold it. Look who's over there. Don't look, don't look! It's Fred Savage. 

CHELSEA

Big deal. 

KRAMER

He'd be perfect for my movie. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. (takes a deep breath) I gotta go over there, I gotta give him a copy of my treatment. 

CHELSEA

Why are you breathing so hard? 

KRAMER

Well, I'm just a little nervous. OK, I gotta relax. Phew. Wish me luck, huh? 

KRAMER

Hey. Oh, did I frighten you? I'm not crazy. I mean, I may look weird, but I'm just like you, I'm just a regular guy just trying to make it in this business. You know I really like your work, the, uh... 

SAVAGE

Thank you. 

KRAMER

Yeah, I can't remember the name of it. 

FRED

Thanks. 

KRAMER

Yeah, my mind's a blank, I'm sorta nervous, you know, uh... 

FRED

That's ok. Relax, relax. 

KRAMER

Ok, but I got this... 

KRAMER

Stupid table. You know, I'm not normally like this, usually I'm very cool and charming, I don't mean to bother you or anything but I think it's fate that you happened to be here at the same time as me. 

FRED

Yeah, its fate, you know, can't avoid your fate. 

KRAMER

I got this treatment I think you'll be great in. 

FRED

Yeah. 

KRAMER

So I'd like to give it to you. 

FRED

Yeah, thank you, thanks a lot. Bye! 

KRAMER

(bumping into a lamp) Alright, excuse me. Uh wait, wait. 

JERRY

Yeah, Kramer. K-R-A-M-E-R. Uh, I don't know, wavy? George, how would you describe Kramer's hair? 

GEORGE

Curly. 

JERRY

Wavy. 

GEORGE

What'd you ask me for? 

JERRY

Yeah, I'll hold on. Hey George, did you see a piece of paper I had on the nightstand here, like crumpled up, like a napkin? 

GEORGE

Nope. 

JERRY

'Cause I had like three jokes on it, they were all perfectly worded just the way I wanted to have it. Can't find it. Hello? 

GEORGE

Hey, a shoe buffing machine! 

JERRY

I don't know, 6-3, George, how tall is Kramer? 

GEORGE

You got your own shampoo, conditioner, body lotion! Jerry, body 

JERRY

About 6-3. 

GEORGE

Ooh, a shower cap! 

JERRY

Coming. 

LUPE

Hello. I have more towels. 

GEORGE

Oh good, good, come in. Come in, welcome. I'm George. And this is Jerry, over there, on the phone, that's Jerry. And you are, um? 

LUPE

Lupe. 

GEORGE

Lupe. That's very nice, very nice. Listen, are you going to be making up the bed in the morning? 

LUPE

Oh Yes. 

GEORGE

Fine. Excellent. Could you do me a favor? Could you not tuck the blankets in? 'Cause I can't sleep all tucked in. 

LUPE

Oh, yes, yes. 

GEORGE

Yes, I like to just be able to take the blankets and swish them and swirl them, you know what I mean? You know, I don't like being all tucked in. I like to have a lot of room, you know I like to have my toes pointed up in the air. Just like to scrunch up the blankets. 

LUPE

Yes, yes. It's too tight to sleep. 

GEORGE

Exactly, you know what I'm talking about, right? 

LUPE

Oh yees, It's too tight. (Gesturing towards Jerry) Him too? 

GEORGE

Uh, Jerry, you want your blankets tucked in? 

JERRY

Excuse me, what? 

GEORGE

You want your blankets tucked in? 

JERRY

What blankets? 

GEORGE

When Lupe makes up the beds in the morning. 

JERRY

I don't know, whatever they do. 

LUPE

I tuck in? Yes? 

JERRY

Tuck in, tuck in. 

GEORGE

Alright, so that's one tuck and one no-tuck. 

LUPE

Okay. 

GEORGE

Yeah. One second sweetheart. Jerry, I really think it'd be easier if you didn't tuck. 

JERRY

Excuse me, fine, you don't want me to tuck, put me down for a no-tuck. 

GEORGE

Two no-tucks. 

JERRY

Uh, hang on a second, You know what? Changed my mind, make it a tuck. 

GEORGE

You just said you weren't tucking. 

JERRY

I'm tucking! Hello? Hello? They hung up on me. They don't know where Kramer is anyway. 

GEORGE

Alrighty, so. That's one tuck and one no-tuck. Got that? 

JERRY

Excuse me, um, did you see a piece of paper on the nightstand here earlier today crumpled up like a napkin? 

LUPE

Oh, yes, yes. I throw away when we clean the room. 

JERRY

Oh, okay, thanks. 

LUPE

Thank you. 

GEORGE

Thank you. 

LUPE

Bye-bye. 

GEORGE

Alright, Lupe, bye-bye now. 

LUPE

Bye. 

GEORGE

Bye-bye. 

JERRY

I can't believe she threw that out. I had like the perfect wording of a whole joke I was gonna do about the X-ray counter at the airport, I was gonna do it on the Tonight Show, now I can't remember it. 

GEORGE

Well what did you want her to do, you left it on the night table. 

JERRY

They're not supposed to just take everything and throw it out! 

GEORGE

Hey, hey, hey! It's not Lupe's fault, you shouldn't have left it out. 

JERRY

Alright, just get your thing together and let's get out of here. 

GEORGE

Alright, now. What mood am I in, what mood am I in? 

GEORGE

You shouldn't have tucked. 

JERRY

I like it tucked. 

GEORGE

Nobody tucks anymore. 

OFFICER

Hey, Lieutenant. 

OFFICER

This was found on her person. 

OFFICER

I don't know, sir. Police lingo. 

OFFICER

Ross. 

OFFICER

Yes sir. 

OFFICER

Yes sir. 

OFFICER

Yes sir. 

GEORGE

This is very exciting! You're on the Tonight Show, NBC, who else is on the show? 

JERRY

I don't know. 

GEORGE

Might meet a celebrity. 

JERRY

I can't believe she threw out my napkin. 

GEORGE

What are you worried about, you know it. 

JERRY

You gonna be alright here? 

GEORGE

Yeah yeah yeah yeah, go. Go about your business, I'll just wander around. 

JERRY

Alright, don't wander too far, I'll meet you back here in fifteen minutes. 

GEORGE

Go, go, go, don't worry about it. 

GEORGE

Hey. (pointing at him) Corbin Bernsen. 

BERNSEN

How ya doing? 

GEORGE

Big fan! Big fan. 

BERNSEN

Yeah. 

GEORGE

Hey, you grew a beard, huh? 

BERNSEN

Yeah, yeah. I'm doing a movie during my hiatus. 

GEORGE

Hey. You know, do I have a case for you guys to do on L.A. Law. 

BERNSEN

Really. 

GEORGE

...so mind you, at this point I'm only going out with her two or three weeks. So she goes out of town and she asks me to feed her cat. So at this time, there's a lot of stuff going on in my life and, uh, it slips my mind for a few days. Maybe a week. Not a week, five, six days. 

BERNSEN

Yeah yeah yeah. So what happened? 

GEORGE

Well, it's the damnedest thing. The cat dies. So she comes back into town, she finds the cat lying on the carpet stiff as a board. 

BERNSEN

So you killed the cat. 

GEORGE

That's what she says. I say, listen. It was an old cat. It died of natural causes. So get this, now she tells me that I gotta buy her a brand new cat. I say listen, honey. First of all, it was a pretty old cat. I'm not gonna buy you a brand new cat to replace an old dying cat. And second of all, I go out to the garbage, I find you a new cat in fifteen seconds. I say, you show me an autopsy report that says this cat died of starvation, I spring for a new cat. So she says something to me, like, uh, I dunno, get the hell out of here, and she breaks up with me. Now don't you think that would be a great case on L.A. Law? 

GEORGE

I don't wanna tell you how to run your show. 

WENDT

Oh, of course not. 

GEORGE

But really, it's enough with the bar already. 

WENDT

Yeah, well. 

GEORGE

Seriously, have they though about changing the setting? 

WENDT

Doubt it, I doubt it. Yeah. 

GEORGE

Really? Because people do meet in places besides a bar, huh? 

WENDT

Well yeah, they do, heh heh. 

GEORGE

What about a rec room? Huh? Or a community center. 

WENDT

Yeah, you oughta write one of those. 

GEORGE

Yeah? 

WENDT

Yeah, I'll bring it up with the producers, I gotta... uh... 

GEORGE

Fabulous, I'll think about that George, thank you! 

JERRY

How's it going? 

GEORGE

Great! Great! I actually just had two meaningful intelligent conversations with Corbin Bernsen and George Wendt. 

JERRY

Really? 

GEORGE

Yeah, yeah, not fan talk, not gushing, you know? Actual conversation, I was incredibly articulate! 

JERRY

You got toilet paper on your heel there. 

BERNSEN

Oh yeah, yeah, people are always coming up to me trying to give me a great case for L.A. Law, just a few seconds ago, right here, right outside in the hallway this nut, some sick nut comes up to me and says he's supposed to watch this girl's cat while she's away out of town. Anyway he forgets to feed the cat, the cat dies, starves to death, he kills the cat, refuses to get her a new one, won't give her any money, won't pay her, and he wants Arnie Becker to represent him. Nice guy. Yeah, that'd make a *great* case for L.A. Law. Thanks a lot. 

HELENA

He's a very handsome man. Passionate, intense, but troubled, strange. I think he may be in love with me. Of course there's nothing abnormal about that, I have many suitors. 

WENDT

It's funny, 'cause even after all these years, we still get people giving us advice, how to improve the show. Actually, a few moments ago I ran into a nut back there, he said, you know, that maybe we should think about, you know, not doing the show in a bar. 

FREAK

So that's when I said, 'Hey, Kramer, dude. You ever killed a man before?' And he said, 'What do you think, Junior? These hands have been soaking in Ivory liquid? 

WENDT

The guy you talked to, what did he look like? 

BERNSEN

Short little bald guy with glasses. 

WENDT

Yeah, yeah, that's the same guy I talked to. 

BERNSEN

It never ends, does it? 

JERRY

So I'm going through the airport and I have to put my bag on that little uh, uh, the uh, that uh, the conveyor belt. 

MARTEL

Issue an arrest warrant, put out an APB. Let's pick up this, uh, Kramer. 

JERRY

I was terrible. 

GEORGE

What are you, crazy? You were fine. 

JERRY

Nah, did you hear the end? I couldn't remember what I was trying to say, that whole thing about the, uh... 

GEORGE

Conveyor belt. 

JERRY

Yeah. Because she threw out my napkin. 

GEORGE

I can't believe, you're blaming Lupe? 

JERRY

Yes, Lupe. I'm blaming Lupe. 

NEWSCASTER

Our top story tonight, there has been a break in the so called 'Smog Stranglings'. Police have just released a photo of the suspect being sought in connection with the slayings. He is known only as 'Kramer'. 

GEORGE

He's on the lamb(?), he's on the loose! 

JERRY

Would you let go of my arm?! I'm trying to drive, you're getting us both killed! 

GEORGE

What are we supposed to do? What do you do on a situation like this? Should we call a lawyer, should we call the police? 

JERRY

Obviously we're gonna call the police and tell that he's not the guy. 

GEORGE

Hope he's not the guy. 

JERRY

Couldn't be the guy...nah. 

GEORGE

God, I'm starved, I'm weak from hunger. 

JERRY

How can you think of food at the time like this? 

GEORGE

Time like what? I'm hungry. My stomach doesn't know that Kramer's wanted. 

JERRY

I told you to have breakfast, you should've had breakfast! 

GEORGE

I couldn't have breakfast, it was lunchtime! The three hour time difference threw me. I wanted a tuna fish sandwich, they wouldn't serve me tuna fish sandwich, because they were only serving breakfast. 

JERRY

You should've had some eggs. 

GEORGE

For lunch? Who eats eggs for lunch? 

JERRY

Have you ever heard of egg salad? 

GEORGE

Why didn't you say something then? 

JERRY

I've gotta to tell you about existence of egg salad? 

GEORGE

I need food, Jerry. I feel faint, I'm getting light headed. 

JERRY

I've gotta call the police, there's a pay phone over there. 

GEORGE

Pay phone in L.A., look it's a miracle. 

JERRY

I don't have any change. You've got any change? 

GEORGE

No, I don't have any change. I never carry change. 

JERRY

Well, we need change and all I have is twenties. 

GEORGE

I have a ten. 

JERRY

So, break it. 

GEORGE

I hate asking for change. They always make a face. Like I'm asking them to donate a kidney. 

JERRY

So, buy something. 

GEORGE

What? 

JERRY

I don't know, some mints or TicTacs. 

GEORGE

Breath problem? 

JERRY

No, I just want some change. 

GEORGE

Tell me. 

JERRY

Your breath is fine. It's delightful, it's delicious. 

GEORGE

You know, I haven't eaten anything. 

JERRY

I just wanna call the police! 

GEORGE

Why don't you just call 911? 

JERRY

But is this an emergency? 

GEORGE

Of course it is. 

JERRY

How is this an emergency? 

GEORGE

Your friend is been accused of being a serial killer. I think that qualifies. 

JERRY

All right, I'll call 911. Think he did it? Could've he done it? Couldn't done it? How could've he done it? Couldn't be? Could it? Hello 911? How are you? I'm sorry it was just a reflex...I know it's an emergency number...it is an emergency...my friend is being accused of being a smog strangler and I know he didn't do it...they're putting me trough to the detective in charge of the investigation...what is my name? Who am I? I'm eh...George Costanza... 

GEORGE

What's the matter with you? Are you crazy? Why are you using my name?! 

JERRY

Oh, don't be a baby! What are you scared of? 

GEORGE

What am I scared of? I'm scared of the same thing that you are, everything! Why don't you just use your own name? 

JERRY

Your name is a good name, Costanza. Sounds like it's stands for something, they'll believe us. 

GEORGE

Really? 

JERRY

Sure. 

GEORGE

You think so? 

JERRY

Oh yeah. Yes I have some very important information regarding the smog strangler. (George leans close) would you suck a mint or something. Can I come right now? I suppose, where are you located? Where is that? I don't know where we are. Where are we? 

GEORGE

I don't know. 

JERRY

We don't know. He says ask somebody, ask that guy. 

GEORGE

Excuse me, where are we? 

MAN

Earth. 

JERRY

Hey, you know I'm on the phone with the police! Some guy just gave me a wise answer. Ask that woman. 

GEORGE

Excuse me Ms. which street are we on? 

WOMAN

I don't know. 

GEORGE

You don't know? 

WOMAN

I don't know. 

GEORGE

How come you don't know what street are you on? 

WOMAN

You don't know. 

JERRY

George, it says it here on the phone. It's 12145 Ventura Boulevard. Aha, ok...do we know where the 101 is? (George shakes his head) No...do we know where 170 is? (George shakes his head) No...do we know where 134 is? (George just looks at Jerry) No. Aha, ok. (Jerry hangs up) He's gonna send a black and white to pick us up. 

GEORGE

Black and white? 

JERRY

A cop car. 

GEORGE

Why didn't you just say that? 

JERRY

I thought it sounded kind of cool. 

GEORGE

Oh yeah, real cool. You're a cool guy. 

JERRY

Oh, you are? I guaranty you, Lupe is going to tuck your covers in. 

GEORGE

I'll bet you, how much? 

JERRY

Her tip. 

GEORGE

You've got a bet. 

JERRY

Ok. 

GEORGE

How much do you tip a chamber maid? 

POLICE

Which one of you is Costanza? 

POLICE

Get in. 

GEORGE

Hi, how are you guys? Listen, does either one of you have like a mint or piece of gum or... 

GEORGE

Jerry, would you do me a favor, close the window. 

JERRY

Hey, get out of here...hey officer, he's fooling around back here. 

COP

Cut it up back there. 

GEORGE

He started it. 

JERRY

I did not. You guys gonna go through some red lights? 

COP

I don't think so. 

JERRY

But you could? 

COP

Oh yeah, of course we could. We can do anything we want. 

COP

Yeah, we do that all the time. You should see the looks on people's faces. 

GEORGE

You guys ever shot anybody? 

COPS

No... 

GEORGE

Hey, can I flip on the siren? 

JERRY

Why are you bothering them for? 

GEORGE

I'm just asking, all they have to do is say no. 

COP

Yeah, go ahead. 

GEORGE

Wohoo, check it out. 

JERRY

Can I try it? 

COP

Yeah, go ahead, hurry up. 

JERRY

Scared the hell out of that guy. 

GEORGE

You know what I never understood? Why did they change the siren noise? When I was a kid it was always 'waaaa, waaaa', you know now it 'woo-woo-woo-woo-woo'. Why did they do that, did they do some research? Did they find that woo-woo was more effective than waa? 

JERRY

Yeah, what about those English sirens, you know...eee-aaa-eee-aaa-eee-aaa... 

GEORGE

Eee-aaa-eee-aaa-eee-aaa... 

COP

Hey! 

KRAMER

I'm dizzy. 

JERRY

Nice shotgun. 

COP

Thanks. 

JERRY

Clean as a whistle. 

GEORGE

You could eat of that shotgun. 

JERRY

What is that, a 12 gauge? 

COP

Yeah. 

JERRY

12 gauge. Seems to be the most popular gauge. 

GEORGE

My favorite. 

JERRY

Mine too, love the 12 gauge. 

GEORGE

Makes the 11 gauge look like a cap pistol. 

COP

What do got over there? 

COP

Looks like a possible 5-19. 

JERRY

5-19? What's a 5-19? 

GEORGE

Where? 

COP

Looks like it. 

JERRY

I can't believe this. A 5-19? 

GEORGE

Where, where? I can't see. 

COP

This is car 23, we have a possible 5-19 in progress, over. 

JERRY

Pull over? You can't pull over. 

GEORGE

What are you doing? Where do you think you're going? 

JERRY

Pull over? The lieutenant is waiting to see us. 

GEORGE

Hey hey hey, we're in a rush here. 

JERRY

We have an appointment! 

GEORGE

What are you doing?! 

JERRY

Great. 

GEORGE

There's a bag of Pepperidge Farm cookies up there. 

JERRY

Which flavor? 

GEORGE

Milano. 

JERRY

Cops eating Milanos. What crazy town is this? 

GEORGE

Should I take some? 

JERRY

I think that's a 5-19. 

GEORGE

I'm starving... 

JERRY

They're busting this guy. 

GEORGE

They're cuffing him. 

JERRY

I can't believe this. 

GEORGE

Hi. 

JERRY

Hi, I'm Jerry. 

GEORGE

George, how you doing? 

GUY

What did you do? 

GEORGE

Nothing. 

JERRY

Nothing. 

GUY

Oh yeah right, me neither. Hey I didn't do nothing! 

COP

Shut up. 

JERRY

Hot out. 

GUY

Brutal. 

GEORGE

What do you tip a chamber maid. 

GUY

I don't know, five bucks a night. 

JERRY

No, a dollar, two tops. 

GUY

Hey, you guys aren't cuffed. What are you, narks? 

GEORGE

Narks? 

JERRY

Imagine, us narks? 

GEORGE

No no no, you know actually we are friends of a serial killer. 

GUY

Really? Well, that's very nice. 

GEORGE

Oh, thank you. 

JERRY

Suspected serial killer, he didn't actually do it. 

GEORGE

Yeah well, we don't think. 

JERRY

We're pretty sure. 

GUY

A dollar a night? 

JERRY

Yeah, that's a good tip! 

GUY

That stinks! 

JERRY

I read it in Ann Landers. 

GUY

Oh, Ann Landers sucks! 

RADIO

Attention all units, attention all units, all units code 3. All units in the area, code 3 in progress, 1648 North Bartholis, units required for assistance in apprehension of 702. 

COP

That's smog strangler. 

JERRY

Kramer. 

JERRY

I wanna see what's happening. 

GEORGE

I don't know why I'm doing this. 

KRAMER

Jerry, George! 

MARTEL

You are under arrest in first degree murder and death of Ms Chelsea Lang. 

REPORTERS

Why did you do it? What possessed you? 

KRAMER

I don't know... 

KRAMER

Hey, how are you doing? Jerry! George! 

JERRY

We're doing fine. How are you? 

KRAMER

What me? Fabulous, just fabulous. I've got a lot of auditions, a lot of call backs and I've got a lot of interest for my movie treatment. I'm in development, I'm in developed vehicles. And there's a lot of energy here, man. You know, the vibe, it's powerful. I'm just swept up at it. Yeah, I'm a player. 

GEORGE

A player? 

KRAMER

Yeah, a player... 

JERRY

Kramer, do you realize what's going on here? Do you know why you're here? 

KRAMER

What? What this? I'll be out of here in couple of hours. Hey, guess who I met today? Rick Savage, oh nice kid, really good kid. You know, we're talking about doing a project together. 

JERRY

Kramer, you've been arrested as a serial killer! 

KRAMER

So? I'm innocent! I mean you guys believe that I'm innocent, don't you? Jerry? George? 

JERRY

Well, yeah...sure. 

POLICE

Kramer, let's go. The Lieutenant wants to see you. 

KRAMER

Ok, yeah. All right look, I'll be out of here by noon. Maybe we'll have lunch together, huh? 

KRAMER

Help me!! Help me! 

KRAMER

I didn't kill anyone, I swear! I swear to God! 

MARTEL

Don't you ever swear to my God, Kramer. My God is the god who protects the innocent and punishes the evil scum like you, have you got that? 

KRAMER

You're making a big mistake. 

MARTEL

No! You have made the mistake, Kramer. Sickies like you always do. The only difference is that this time you're gonna pay. 

KRAMER

What? 

MARTEL

Now you might beat the gas chamber Kramer, but as long as I have got a breath in my body you will never ever see the light of day again. 

KRAMER

Wow wow wow wow, you've got the wrong man!! It wasn't me! 

MARTEL

Oh yeah, right. Maybe it was one of your other personalities huh, the wise guy, the little kid, the bellhop, the ball player, maybe the door to door vacuum cleaner salesman, but not you right? No, you wouldn't hurt a fly. You just couldn't help yourself, could you Kramer? You saw life brimming brightly with optimism and verve and you just had to snuff it out. 

KRAMER

Ok, can I just talk to somebody? Can I just explain... 

MARTEL

I'm not interested in your explanations, Kramer! Sure, I bet you've got a million of 'em. Maybe your mother didn't love you enough, maybe the teacher didn't call on you in school when you had your little hand raised, maybe the pervert in the park had a present in his pants, huh? Well, I've got another theory you're a weed. 

KRAMER

No... 

MARTEL

Society is filled with them. They're choking the life out of the all pretty flowers. 

MARTEL

You see something even remotely pretty and you have to choke the life out if it, don't you Kramer? 

MARTEL

You killed all the pretty flowers, didn't you Kramer? You killed the pretty little flowers, didn't you? You dirty, filthy, stinky weed! Didn't you? 

OFFICER

Lieutenant, it's for you. 

MARTEL

Martel...yeah...yeah...yeah...yeah. 

OFFICER

What it is, Lieutenant? 

MARTEL

Let him go. 

OFFICER

What, but Lieutenant? 

MARTEL

You heard me, let him go. They just found another body at the Laurel Canyon. Go on Kramer, get out of my sight. 

KRAMER

Hey, how did you know about the guy in the park? 

MARTEL

I said beat it! 

KRAMER

Hahaa! 

GEORGE

What? 

JERRY

What happened? 

KRAMER

Somebody got killed while they had me in custody. 

JERRY

Really? Did you hear that? Somebody else was killed! 

GEORGE

You're kidding? Somebody else got killed? 

JERRY

While you were in jail. So you're free. 

KRAMER

Yes, I'm free. (singing) 'cause the murderer struck again! 

JERRY

So Kramer, what are you going to do? 

KRAMER

Do? Do? Hey, I'm doing what I do. You know, I've always done what I do. I'm doing what I do, way I've always done and the way I'll always do it. 

GEORGE

Kramer, what the hell are you talking about? 

KRAMER

What do you want me to say? That the things haven't worked out the way that I planned? That I'm struggling, barely able to keep my head above water? That L.A. is a cold place even in the middle of the summer? That it's a lonely place even when your stuck in traffic at the Hollywood Freeway? That I'm no better than a screenwriter driving a cab, a starlet turning tricks, a producer in a house he can't afford? Is that what you want me to say? 

GEORGE

I'd like to hear that. 

JERRY

Yeah... 

KRAMER

Well, I'm not saying that! You know, things are going pretty well for me here. I met a girl... 

JERRY

Kramer, she was murdered! 

KRAMER

Yeah, well I wasn't looking for a long term relationship. I was on TV. 

GEORGE

As a suspect in a serial killing. 

KRAMER

Ok, yeah, you guys got to put a negative spin on everything. 

GEORGE

What did they put on this tuna? Tastes like a dill, I think it's a dill. 

JERRY

So you're not gonna come back to New York with us? 

KRAMER

No no I'm not ready, things are starting to happen. 

GEORGE

Taste this, is this a dill? 

JERRY

No, it's tarragon. Hey Kramer, I'm sorry about that whole fight we had about you having my apartment keys and everything. 

KRAMER

Ok, it's forgotten. 

GEORGE

Tarragon? Oh, you're crazy. 

JERRY

Well, take it easy. 

KRAMER

Yeah, ok. 

GEORGE

Yeah, take care. Stay in touch. 

KRAMER

Hey hey, whoa come on give me a hug... 

JERRY

Oh, no... 

GEORGE

No, you're crushing my sandwich. 

JERRY

Yeah, it's so nice when it happens to you. 

GEORGE

Mint? 

JERRY

No thanks. 

GEORGE

I've got to tell you, I'm really disappointed in Lupe. 

JERRY

It's been three days already, forget about Lupe. 

GEORGE

Do you think she gets to take any of those little bars of soap home? 

JERRY

No, I don't. 

GEORGE

You would think that at the end of the week when they hand out the checks, throw in a few soaps. 

JERRY

Yeah, maybe they should throw in a couple of lamps too. 

GEORGE

I'll tell you something, if I'd own a company, my employees would love me. They'd have huge pictures of me up on the walls and in their home, like Lenin. 

JERRY

How much did you wound up tipping her? 

GEORGE

Oh my God, I forgot! 

JERRY

Well, communism didn't work. 

KRAMER

Hey! 

KRAMER

Any mustard? This is empty. 

JERRY

Yeah, there's a new one in there. 

KRAMER

No no, I don't like this one. It's too yellow. Any pickles? 

JERRY

Help yourself. 

KRAMER

Yeah, all right. 

GEORGE

Kramer, what are you doing here? 

KRAMER

Getting something to eat. 

JERRY

Kramer, here! 

GEORGE

What did they do for toilet paper in the civil war? 

JERRY

What? 

GEORGE

I wonder what toilet paper was loike in the 1860's. Did they carry it in rolls in their duffle bags? 

JERRY

Everything with you comes down to toilet paper. 

GEORGE

What? 

JERRY

That's always the first question with you. Why is that always your focus? 

GEORGE

All right, so what did they do? 

JERRY

I don't know. Maybe they gave out fig leaf clumps to all the soldiers. 

GEORGE

Well I think it would be nice if there was some kind of historical record of it. 

JERRY

Maybe they should have a toilet paper museum. Would you like that? So we could see all the toilet paper advancements down through the ages. Toilet paper of the Crusades, the development of the perforation, the first six-pack . . . 

STU

Excuse me, Jerry? I'm Stu Chermak. I'm with NBC. 

JERRY

Hi. 

STU

Could we speak for a few moments? 

JERRY

Sure. 

JAY

Hi, Jay Crespi. 

JERRY

Hello. 

GEORGE

Uh, C-R-E-S-P-I? 

JAY

That's right. 

GEORGE

I'm unbelievable at spelling last names. Give me a last name. 

JAY

Mm, I'm not- 

JERRY

George- 

GEORGE

(backing off) Huh? All right, fine. 

STU

First of all, that was a terrific show. 

JERRY

Oh thank you very much. 

STU

And basically, I just wanted to let you know that we've been discussing you at some of our meetings and we'd be very interested in doing something. 

JERRY

Really? Wow. 

STU

So, if you have any idea for like a TV show for yourself, well, we'd just love to talk about it. 

JERRY

I'd be very interested in something like that. 

STU

Well, here, uh, why don't you give us a call and maybe we can develop a series. 

JERRY

Okay. Great. Thanks. 

STU

It was very nice meeting you. 

JERRY

Thank you. 

JAY

Nice meeting you. 

JERRY

Nice meeting you. 

GEORGE

What was that all about? 

JERRY

They said they were interested in me. 

GEORGE

For what? 

JERRY

You know, a TV show. 

GEORGE

Your own show? 

JERRY

Yeah, I guess so. 

GEORGE

They want you to do a TV show? 

JERRY

Well, they want me to come up with an idea. I mean, I don't have any ideas. 

GEORGE

Come on, how hard is that? Look at all the junk that's on TV. You want an idea? Here's an idea. You coach gymnastics team in high school. And you're married. And your son's not interested in gymnastics and you're pushing him into gymnastics. 

JERRY

Why should I care if my son's into gymnastics? 

GEORGE

Because you're a gymnastics teacher. It's only natural. 

JERRY

But gymnastics is not for everybody. 

GEORGE

I know, but he's your son. 

JERRY

So what? 

GEORGE

All right, forget that idea, it's not for you....Okay, okay, I got it. You run an antique store. 

JERRY

Yeah and...? 

GEORGE

And people come in the store and you get involved in their lives. 

JERRY

What person who runs an antique store gets involved in people's lives? 

GEORGE

Why not? 

JERRY

So someone comes in to buy an old lamp and all of a sudden I'm getting them out of a jam? I could see if I was a pharmacist because a pharmacist knows what's wrong with everybody that comes in. 

GEORGE

I know, but antiques are very popular right now. 

JERRY

No they're not, they used to be. 

GEORGE

Oh yeah, like you know. 

JERRY

Oh like you do. 

KRAMER

...And you're the manager of the circus. 

JERRY

A circus? 

KRAMER

Come on, this is a great idea. Look at the characters. You've got all these freaks on the show. A woman with a moustache? I mean, who wouldn't tune in to see a women with a moustache? You've for the tallest man in the world; a guy who's just a head. 

JERRY

I don't think so. 

KRAMER

Look Jerry, the show isn't about the circus, it's about watching freaks. 

JERRY

I don't think the network will go for it. 

KRAMER

Why not? 

JERRY

Look, I'm not pitching a show about freaks. 

KRAMER

Oh come on Jerry, you're wrong. People they want to watch freaks. This is a 'can't miss.' 

JERRY

Hello Newman. 

NEWMAN

Come on lets go. I got the helmet. Lets get the radar detector. 

KRAMER

All right I'll be back in a second. You guys coming to my party? (exits) 

NEWMAN

Yeah, sure. 

JERRY

What's this all about? 

NEWMAN

We're making a trade. I'm giving him my motorcycle helmet - he's giving me his radar detector. 

JERRY

I didn't know you had a motorctcle. 

NEWMAN

Well my girlfriend had one. 

JERRY

You have a girlfriend? 

NEWMAN

I HAD a girlfriend and she was pretty wild. 

JERRY

I never remember you with a girl. 

NEWMAN

Nevertheless, ... 

JERRY

This is a pretty bad deal for Kramer. You know a radar detector is worth much more than that helmet. I think you're cheating him. 

NEWMAN

Don't say anything. 

JERRY

All right. 

JERRY

You know you're getting gypped over here. 

KRAMER

Really, Ah, 

NEWMAN

We had a deal. Are you reneging out of the deal? Are you reneging? That's a renege. 

KRAMER

Oh, stop saying 'reneging'. 

NEWMAN

Well you're reneging. 

KRAMER

I, Okay, okay. I'm not reneging. 

NEWMAN

All right give it to me. let go ... 

KRAMER

You let go - come on ...(they fight over the items) 

JERRY

Gimme that - just gimme that. Here. Idiots! 

NEWMAN

Thanks buddy. So long he he ...(exits) 

JERRY

Does that thing work? 

KRAMER

Nah. 

JERRY

... I just got a postcard from Elaine? 

GEORGE

Really? 

JERRY

Yeah, they're in London now. They'll be back in a few weeks. 

GEORGE

I can't believe she got involved with a shrink. 

GEORGE

So, what's happening with the TV show? You come up with anything? 

JERRY

No, nothing. 

GEORGE

Why don't they have salsa on the table? 

JERRY

What do you need salsa for? 

GEORGE

Salsa is now the number one condiment in America. 

JERRY

You know why? Because people like to say 'salsa.' 'Excuse me, do you have salsa?' 'We need more salsa.' 'Where is the salsa? No salsa?' 

GEORGE

You know it must be impossible for a Spanish person to order seltzer and not get salsa. (Angry) 'I wanted seltzer, not salsa.' 

JERRY

'Don't you know the difference between seltzer and salsa?? You have the seltezer after the salsa!' 

GEORGE

See, this should be a show. This is the show. 

JERRY

What? 

GEORGE

This. Just talking. 

JERRY

(dismissing) Yeah, right. 

GEORGE

I'm really serious. I think that's a good idea. 

JERRY

Just talking? Well what's the show about? 

GEORGE

It's about nothing. 

JERRY

No story? 

GEORGE

No forget the story. 

JERRY

You've got to have a story. 

GEORGE

Who says you gotta have a story? Remember when we were waiting for, for that table in that Chinese restaurant that time? That could be a TV show. 

JERRY

And who is on the show? Who are the characters? 

GEORGE

I could be a character. 

JERRY

You? 

GEORGE

Yeah. You could base a character on me. 

JERRY

So, on the show, there's a character named George Costanza? 

GEORGE

Yeah. There's something wrong with that? I'm a character. People are always saying to me, 'You know you're a quite a character.' 

JERRY

And who else is on the show? 

GEORGE

Elaine could be a character. Kramer.. 

JERRY

Now he's a character. (Pause) So everybody I know is a character on the show. 

GEORGE

Right. 

JERRY

And it's about nothing? 

GEORGE

Absolutely nothing. 

JERRY

So you're saying, I go in to NBC, and tell them I got this idea for a show about nothing. 

GEORGE

We go into NBC. 

JERRY

'We'? Since when are you a writer? 

GEORGE

(Scoffs) Writer. We're talking about a sit-com. 

JERRY

You want to go with me to NBC? 

GEORGE

Yeah. I think we really go something here. 

JERRY

What do we got? 

GEORGE

An idea. 

JERRY

What idea? 

GEORGE

An idea for the show. 

JERRY

I still don't know what the idea is. 

GEORGE

It's about nothing. 

JERRY

Right. 

GEORGE

Everybody's doing something, we'll do nothing. 

JERRY

So, we go into NBC, we tell them we've got an idea for a show about nothing. 

GEORGE

Exactly. 

JERRY

They say, 'What's your show about?' I say, 'Nothing.' 

GEORGE

There you go. 

JERRY

(Nodding) I think you may have something there. 

JERRY

So, the show would be about my real life. And one of the characters would be based on you. 

KRAMER

(Thinks) No, I don't think so. 

JERRY

What do you mean you don't think so? 

KRAMER

I don't like it. 

JERRY

I don't understand. What don't you like about it? 

KRAMER

I don't like the idea of a character based on me. 

JERRY

Why not? 

KRAMER

well it just doesn't sit well. 

JERRY

You're my neighbor. There's got to be a character based on you. 

KRAMER

That's your problem, buddy. 

JERRY

I don't understand what the big deal is. 

KRAMER

Hey, I'll tell you what - you can do it on one condition. 

JERRY

Whatever you want. 

KRAMER

I get to play Kramer. 

JERRY

You can't play Kramer. 

KRAMER

I am Kramer. 

JERRY

But you can't act. 

KRAMER

Phew! 

JERRY

Okay, fine. We'll use Newman. 

KRAMER

Newman? 

JERRY

Nothin' What do you want? 

KRAMER

Yeah. That's strange. 

KRAMER

That's queer uh? 

NEWMAN

I WANT MY HELMET BACK! GIVE ME BACK MY HELMET AND YOU'RE GOING TO PAY FOR THAT TICKET. 

KRAMER

Yeah, you better think again Mojumbo. 

JERRY

Buyer beware. 

KRAMER

No. We had a deal. There are no guarantees in life. 

JERRY

Karma Kramer? 

JERRY

(To himself) Salsa, seltzer. Hey, excuse me, you got any salsa? No, not selzer, salsa. (George doesn't react) What's the matter? 

GEORGE

(Nervous) Nothing. 

JERRY

You sure? You look a little pale. 

GEORGE

No, I'm fine. I'm good. I'm very good. 

JERRY

What, are you nervous? 

GEORGE

No, not nervous. I'm good, very good. (A beat, then he snaps) I can't do this! Can't do this! 

JERRY

What? 

GEORGE

I can't do this! I can't do it. I have tried. I'm here. It's impossible. 

JERRY

This was your idea! 

GEORGE

What idea? I just said something. I didn't know you were going to listen to me. 

JERRY

Dont' worry about it. They're just TV executives. 

GEORGE

They're men with jobs, Jerry! They wear suits and ties. They're married, they have secretaries. 

JERRY

I told you not to come. 

GEORGE

I need some water. I gotta get some water. 

JERRY

They'll give us water in there. 

GEORGE

Really? That's pretty good. 

JERRY

Oh God, it's Joe Devola. 

GEORGE

Who? 

JERRY

This guy's a writer, he's a total nut. I think he goes to the same shrink as Elaine. 

JERRY

Oh God he saw me. 

DEVOLA

Hello Jerry. 

JERRY

Hey Joe! HOW YOU DOING? 

DEVOLA

You're under no obligation to shake my hand. 

JERRY

Oh, no, Just a custom. Uh, THAT'S MY FRIEND GEORGE. YOU LOOK GOOD. 

DEVOLA

Why shouldn't I look good? 

JERRY

Oh, no reason. You're into karate right? 

DEVOLA

You want to hit me? 

JERRY

What are you doing here? 

DEVOLA

I dreopped a script off. 

JERRY

AH, GOOD FOR YOU. 

JERRY

Well, ... 

DEVOLA

You don't have to say anything. 

JERRY

No, Uh, hey I guess I'll see you Sunday night. 

DEVOLA

Why? 

JERRY

Kramer's party. 

DEVOLA

Kramer's ... having ... a ... party? 

JERRY

No, no, he's not having a party. He's doing something. I don't know what it is. It's nothing. He's not doing anything. 

DEVOLA

Gee, I thought Kramer and I were very close friends. 

JERRY

No, I'm sure you are. I'm sure you are very close friends. Very close. 

JERRY

Give my best to Hinckley. 

GEORGE

What was that? 

JERRY

I can't believe what I just did. I didn't know kramer didn't invite him. I better call Kramer, ... 

RECEPTIONIST

They're ready for you. 

GEORGE

Okay, okay. Look, you do all the talking, okay? 

JERRY

Relax. Who are they? 

GEORGE

Yeah, they're not better than me. 

JERRY

Course not. 

GEORGE

Who are they? 

JERRY

They're nobody. 

GEORGE

What about me? 

JERRY

What about you? 

GEORGE

Why them? Why not me? 

JERRY

Why not you? 

GEORGE

I'm as good as them. 

JERRY

Better. 

GEORGE

You really think so? 

JERRY

No. 

STU

(To Jerry, laughing about one of his bits) The bit, the bit I really liked what were the parakeet flew into the mirror. Now that's funny. 

GEORGE

The parakeet in the mirror. That's a good one, Stu. 

JERRY

Yeah, it's one of my favorites. 

RUSSELL

What about you, George? Have you written anything we might know? 

GEORGE

(Quickly making it up) Well, possibly. I wrote an off-Broadway show, 'La Cocina.' ..Actually, it was off-off-Broadway. It was a comedy about a Mexican chef. 

JERRY

Oh, it was very funny. There was one great scene with the chef - what was his name? 

GEORGE

Pepe. 

JERRY

Oh, Pepe. Yeah, Pepe. And, uh, he was making tamales. 

SUSAN

Oh, he actually cooked on the stage? 

GEORGE

No, no, he mimed it. That's what was so funny about it. 

RUSSELL

So, what have you two come up with? 

JERRY

Well, we've thought about this in a variety of ways. But the basic idea is I will play myself- 

GEORGE

(Interrupting) May I? 

JERRY

Go ahead. 

GEORGE

I think I can sum up the show for you with one word: NOTHING. 

RUSSELL

Nothing? 

GEORGE

(Smiling) Nothing. 

RUSSELL

(Unimpressed) What does that mean? 

GEORGE

The show is about nothing. 

JERRY

(To George) Well, it's not about nothing. 

GEORGE

(To Jerry) No, it's about nothing. 

JERRY

Well, maybe in philosophy. But, even nothing is something. 

RECEPTIONIST

Mr. Dalrymple, your niece is on the phone. 

RUSSELL

I'll call back. 

RUSSELL

(Obviously dislikes George) Not even close. 

GEORGE

Is it with a 'y'? 

RUSSELL

No. 

SUSAN

What's the premise? 

JERRY

..Well, as I was saying, I would play myself, and, as a comedian, living in New York, I have a friend, a neighbor, and an ex-girlfriend, which is all true. 

GEORGE

Yeah, but nothing happens on the show. You see, it's just like life. You know, you eat, you go shopping, you read.. You eat, you read, You go shopping. 

RUSSELL

You read? You read on the show? 

JERRY

Well, I don't know about the reading.. We didn't discuss the reading. 

RUSSELL

All right, tell me, tell me about the stories. What kind of stories? 

GEORGE

Oh, no. No stories. 

RUSSELL

No stories? So, what is it? 

GEORGE

(Showing an example) What'd you do today? 

RUSSELL

I got up and came to work. 

GEORGE

There's a show. That's a show. 

RUSSELL

(Confused) How is that a show? 

JERRY

Well, uh, maybe something happens on the way to work. 

GEORGE

No, no, no. Nothing happens. 

JERRY

Well, something happens. 

RUSSELL

Well, why am I watching it? 

GEORGE

Because it's on TV. 

RUSSELL

(Threatening) Not yet. 

GEORGE

Okay, uh, look, if you want to just keep on doing the same old thing, then maybe this idea is not for you. I, for one, am not going to compromise my artistic integrity. And I'll tell you something else, this is the show and we're not going to change it. (To Jerry) Right? 

JERRY

(To Russell) How about this: I manage a circus.. 

JERRY

I don't even want to talk about it anymore. What were you thinking? What was going on in your mind? Artistic integrity? Where, where did you come up with that? You're not artistic and you have no integrity. You know you really need some help. A regular psychiatrist couldn't even help you. You need to go to like Vienna or something. You know what I mean? You need to get involved at the University level. Like where Freud studied and have all those people looking at you and checking up on you. That's the kind of help you need. Not the once a week for eighty bucks. No. You need a team. A team of psychiatrists working round the clock thinking about you, having conferences, observing you, like the way they did with the Elephant Man. That's what I'm talking about because that's the only way you're going to get better. 

GEORGE

. . . I thought the woman was kind of cute. 

JERRY

Hold it. I really want to be clear about this. Are you talking about the woman in the meeting? Is that the woman you're talking about? 

GEORGE

Yeah, I thought I might give her a call. I, I don't meet that many women. I meet like three women a year. I mean, we've been introduced. She knows my name. 

JERRY

IT'S COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE! 

GEORGE

Why? Maybe she liked me. I, I mean she was looking right at me. You know, I think she was impressed. You know, we had good eye contact the whole meeting. 

JERRY

Oh, I forgot to call Kramer. 

GEORGE

Wait a minute let me call Susan. 

JERRY

No, no this is more important. 

GEORGE

She might be leaving to work any minute. 

JERRY

No, I got to warn him that I told Joe Devola about his party. 

GEORGE

No. 

ELAINE

What is it? 

RESTON

I was just thinking about this patient of mine. 

ELAINE

What? 

RESTON

Just wondering if he's taking his medication. 

ELAINE

Well, come on we're on vacation. 

JERRY

Well we were standing uh, inn the waiting area there, and you know how Devola is. He's all, ... (buzzer) 

KRAMER

Yeah (to buzzer) 

GEORGE

(OC) It's George. 

JERRY

And so, uh I felt very uncomfortable with him and you know I just blurted out something about your party. 

KRAMER

Whoa, back up a second. 

JERRY

Well, I didn't know that you didn't invite him. 

KRAMER

Why would you think I would invite him? 

JERRY

I just a ssumed, ... 

KRAMER

Assumed? Never assume anything. I don't want that nut in my house. You know he's on medication. 

GEORGE

Hello, oh, hello. You remember, ... Susan, from N B C. 

JERRY

Of course. How are you? 

SUSAN

Fine, it's good to see you. 

GEORGE

And this is Kramer. 

SUSAN

Hello. 

GEORGE

All right go ahead Susan, tell him. 

JERRY

Tell me what? 

SUSAN

Well, I, (phone rings) 

JERRY

Uh, sorry, Excuse me one second. Hello. 

TEL

Hi, would you be interested in switching over to TMI long distance service. 

JERRY

Oh, gee, I can't talk right now. Why don't you give me your home number and I'll call you later. 

TEL

Uh, I'm sorry we're not allowed to do that. 

JERRY

Oh, I guess you don't want people calling you at home. 

TEL

No. 

JERRY

Well now you know how I feel. (Hangs up) 

GEORGE

Well, go ahead, tell him. 

JERRY

Kramer, are you drinking that milk? 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

JERRY

What's the expiration date on that? 

KRAMER

September third. 

JERRY

The third? 

GEORGE

and SUSAN: The third? 

KRAMER

Um, Uh, ugh, ... 

SUSAN

Noooo... (Kramer throws up on Susan) 

GEORGE

I never should have brought her up there. Should have known better. Should have seen it coming. I didn't see it coming. 

JERRY

I think SHE saw it coming. 

GEORGE

You know she was behind the idea. She was going to champion the show. That's what I was bring her up there to tell you. And she liked me. 

JERRY

Look just because Kramer vomited on her doesn't mean the deal is dead. 

GEORGE

What, are you crazy? It's a traumatic thing to be thrown up on. 

JERRY

Vommiting is not a deal breaker. If Hitler had vommited on Chamberlin, Chamberlind still would have given him Chekoslovakia. 

GEORGE

Chamberlind, you could hold his head in nthe toilet, he'd still give you half of Europe. 

JERRY

What happened to you? 

KRAMER

Devola came after me. 

JERRY

What? Devola? See I told you this guy is crazy. I can't believe this. What happened? 

KRAMER

Can I have a coffee. ... What, you know I was walking home and I had to pick up my helmet from the shop, you know. I gota new strap. And I had it on you know, and I was checking the strap out to make sure it fit. Then suddenly I feel this kick hit me on the side of the head. It knocks me down, I look up and it's Crazy Joe Devola. And he say's, 'That's what I thin k of your party.' 

JERRY

Boy, that is some kick. 

KRAMER

Well, yeah, Newman's helmet, it saved my life. Look at that. 

JERRY

Wow, Newman's helmet. 

GEORGE

Holly. 

KRAMER

I got bad news for you buddy. Devola says you're next. 

JERRY

Me, why? 

KRAMER

He doesn't like you. 

JERRY

What does he want from me? I didn't do anything. See this is all Elaine's fault. She took off to Europe with his psychiatrist. He probably can't get his medication. Now I got some nut after me. 

KRAMER

Pass the cream. 

GEORGE

Wait a second. (smells it). all right. 

JERRY

(going through couch cushions) Where the hell did I put this? 

KRAMER

What are you looking for? 

JERRY

The remote, the remote, I can't find the remote. Did I lost, I lost it. Did you take it? Did you put it some place? 

KRAMER

No, no, no. 

JERRY

All right, what is this? 

KRAMER

(clueless) what is what? 

JERRY

All right, very funny. I get it. 

KRAMER

You're in a weird mood. 

JERRY

Come on. Go back to your apartment and fix it. 

KRAMER

Fix what? 

JERRY

Your pants! 

KRAMER

what is this? What have I got one pant leg on for? 

JERRY

Don't you know? Look-look at your face! You only shaved the right side of your face! What is this? A joke? 

KRAMER

No, t's a joke.. a joke... a joke... you think this is funny? 

JERRY

Go look at your face in the mirror. 

KRAMER

Wha-huh-wha-huh... 

JERRY

(pressing intercom) yeah? 

GEORGE

(on intercom) It's George. 

JERRY

Come on up. 

KRAMER

I don't believe this. 

JERRY

You mean, you didn't know you were doing any of these things? 

KRAMER

No, I swear. 

JERRY

I bet this is from that kick from that crazy Joe Davola. You better see a doctor and get some X-rays. 

GEORGE

(to Kramer) Ah! You're just the man I'm looking for. 

KRAMER

Me? 

GEORGE

Yeah, here you go. 

KRAMER

What's this? 

GEORGE

A dry-cleaning bill? 

JERRY

From that woman at NBC? 

GEORGE

Yeah. 

KRAMER

A dry-cleaning bill for what? 

GEORGE

For vomiting on her vest! 

KRAMER

Oh, come on George! I didn't do that on purpose! 

GEORGE

Well, I shouldn't have to pay for it! 

KRAMER

Well, neither should I! Jerry's the one who left the milk in the refrigerator. 

GEORGE

(to Jerry) Yeah, your milk. 

JERRY

(pointing Kramer) He drank it. 

KRAMER

I didn't know. 

JERRY

All right, well, we should all chip in I guess. 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

JERRY

How much was it to clean the vest? 

GEORGE

Eighteen dollars. 

JERRY

Can you get vomit out of suede? 

GEORGE

I don't know. 

KRAMER

Yo-yo Ma! 

JERRY

What? Yo-yo Ma? 

KRAMER

What about him? 

JERRY

You just said 'Yo-yo Ma'. 

GEORGE

What's Yo-yo Ma? 

JERRY

He's a cellist. (to Kramer) You should see a doctor today. 

GEORGE

All right, come on, come on, let's go. Six dollars. 

JERRY

I can't believe she sent you that dry-cleaning bill. 

GEORGE

I know! 

JERRY

That doesn't really bode well for the show, does it? 

GEORGE

The show! Forget about the show! We should take the idea to a different network 

JERRY

Oh, yeah. Right. Like anybody's ever gonna do this! How did you get me to go along with that? A show about nothing! 

GEORGE

It was a good idea. Susan liked it. Now, if he hadn't vomitted all over her, we'd be writing it right now. 

KRAMER

Jeez! 

GEORGE

Anyway. 

JERRY

(interrupts) What are you doing? What's wrong with you? What're you doing? Give me that phone! Go to your apartment and lie down, I'll make an appointment for a doctor today. (on the phone) Hello? Oh hi! I'm sorry. No, that's my next door neighbor. He's not quite himself. He got kicked in the head. What? Really? You're kidding! Today? Yeah! Sure! We could make it. Two o'clock? Yeah, we would do that. Okay. Great! Thanks a million! Okay, bye. 

GEORGE

What? 

JERRY

NBC! They wanna have another meeting about the idea. 

GEORGE

They wanna have another meeting? They wanna buy it?! They wanna but it?! Oh! I tell you! We're gonna be rich!! What are we gonna get for this? Fifty, sixty thousand? 

JERRY

I don't know about sixty. 

GEORGE

Oh, it's gotta be fifty! Hee hee! You know how much Ted Danson makes, huh? 

JERRY

Ted Danson! Now, how are you comparing us to Ted Danson? 

GEORGE

I didn't say 'We're Ted Danson.' 

JERRY

Yes, you did. You said 'We're Ted Danson'! 

GEORGE

Oh! 

JERRY

You know, I think he wears a piece. 

GEORGE

Yeah, don't worry. He can afford it. 

JERRY

I'm ten minutes slow again! That's it for this piece of junk! I've had it. 

GEORGE

What, is that the one your parents gave you? 

JERRY

Yeah! But it never works. You know we're supposed to be there by two o'clock. We should take a cab. 

GEORGE

All right, we'll be a little late, I,m not taking a cab. 

JERRY

I'll pay for it. 

GEORGE

It's not the money! 

JERRY

Well, what is it you object to? The comfort? The Speed? The convenience? 

LEO

Jerry! 

JERRY

Uncle Leo! 

LEO

Helloooo! 

JERRY

Hello there, how're you doing? 

LEO

Ha ha! How are you? 

JERRY

Good, good. 

LEO

How's your mom and dad? 

JERRY

Good, fine. 

LEO

What are you getting to be too much of a big shot now to give me a call? I don't hear from you anymore! 

JERRY

Oh, no. I've been kinda busy. It's all. 

LEO

You know where I just came from? 

JERRY

(not enthousiastic at all) Oh, sure. Danny. 

LEO

He used to be in the pajama business. I used to be able to get pajamas for free. I used to come over and get pajamas all the time! 

JERRY

Oh, yeah, yeah. I remember. 

LEO

The funny thing is: I can't wear 'em. I get too hot. I sleep in my underwear and a t-shirt. If it gets too hot, I just get the t-shirt off! Anyway, Danny says to me: 'You need any pajamas?' 

JERRY

(interrupts) I-I'm sorry Uncle Leo, I really gotta get going. 

LEO

Oh. Well. You gotta get going, so go. 

JERRY

We, we got a big meeting with the president of NBC. 

LEO

Nobody got a gun to your head! 

JERRY

(seems sincere) Yeah, I'm really sorry, uh. 

LEO

Go. Really. I understand. You got an appointment, go to your appointment. 

JERRY

I'm sorry, really. 

LEO

You know, I know plenty of people in Hollywood too! 

JERRY

Sorry, really. 

KRAMER

(from inside) Yeah? 

NEWMAN

Come on, are you ready? Let's go! 

KRAMER

For what? 

NEWMAN

What's the matter with you? I just talked to you fifteen minutes ago. 

KRAMER

what about? 

NEWMAN

The courthouse. You gotta go with me to the courthouse. I'm contesting a ticket today. 

KRAMER

I can't, I'm going to the doctor's later. 

NEWMAN

You gotta go with me. I mean, you-you're my alibi. You have to take the stand. 

KRAMER

Well, I can't! 

NEWMAN

Well, let me remind you of something. You wouldn't be here if it wasn't for me and my helmet. I saved your life! You would be dead! Dead! You would cease to exist! You would be gone for the rest of eternity! You wouldn't even begin to comprehend what that means!! 

KRAMER

Shut up! I'll get my coat! 

KRAMER

Don't step on anything. 

JERRY

You see the look on my uncle's face? Did you see how insulted he was? What could I do? Waht are we supposed to do? You can't leave. There's no excuse good enough to justify walking away from a conversation with one of my relatives. 

GEORGE

I didn't shave this morning. I don't feel like myself. 

JERRY

You could be a fireman on a fire truck on the way to a fire. You bump into one of my relatives. 'I'm sorry Uncle Leo, there's a building full of people burning down. I really do have to be running.' He'll go: 'Go. Go ahead. Go to your fancy fire. If that's what you have to do.' 

GEORGE

Look at this. 

JERRY

Why didn't you shave this morning? 

GEORGE

'Cause I shaved yesterday in the afternoon. 

JERRY

Why? 

GEORGE

Because of the day before. It's a long story. 

JERRY

Is that Joe Davola? 

GEORGE

It's not him! 

JERRY

I can't live tlike this. I'm being stalked. 

JERRY

Oh. 

GEORGE

Mister Seinfeld? What about Mister Costanza? I'm not here? 

JERRY

All right. Look. Now, you promised you're gonna be a little more flexible on the nothing idea, okay? Jsut a little. 

GEORGE

Okay. A little. 

NEWMAN

Okay, you're all set? You got your story? 

KRAMER

No. 

NEWMAN

When the cop stopped me, I told him that I was rushing home because my friend was about to commit suicide. 

KRAMER

Uhm... 

NEWMAN

Now, you're that firend. Now, all we need is a reason why you were going to commit suicide. 

KRAMER

I never had an air conditioner. 

NEWMAN

No! That's no reason to kill yourself! 

KRAMER

Why? It gets hot at night, you can't sleep. You ever tried to sleep in a really hot room? 

NEWMAN

Every night I sleep in a really hot room, I don't want to kill myself. 

KRAMER

Well, I slept in really hot rooms and I wanted to kill myself. 

NEWMAN

No, no, no. That's not gonna work. Something else. 

KRAMER

I was never able to become a banker. 

NEWMAN

Banker! So you're killing yourself because your dreams of becoming a banker have gone unfulfilled. You-you-you-you can't live without being a banker. 

KRAMER

Yeah, yeah. If I can't be banker, I don't wanna live. 

NEWMAN

You must be banker. 

KRAMER

MUST be banker. 

NEWMAN

Okay, we'll go with the banker story. 

GEORGE

The story is the foundation of all entertainment. You must have a good story otherwise it's just masturbation. 

RUSSEL

And people really have to care about the characters. 

GEORGE

Care? Forget about care. Love. They have to love the characters. Otherwise, why would they keep tuning in? 

JERRY

Wouldn't tune in. 

GEORGE

Would they tune in? 

JERRY

No tune. 

RUSSEL

We like to look at the show as if it were in EKG. You have your highs and your lows and it goes up and down. 

GEORGE

The show will be like a heart attack! 

JERRY

Just a huge massive coronary. 

RUSSEL

So what you said last week about no story, you're a little flexible on that now. 

GEORGE

Is-is that what I said 'no story'? Because Jerry had to tell me later. 

JERRY

He couldn't believe it. 

GEORGE

(Laughs, snorts) I said, I said: 'Get outta here! No story? Is that what I said?' 

JUDGE

And then what happened? 

RUSSEL

Look. I don't know how you two guys feel but we would really like to be in business with you. 

GEORGE

Well, we would like to be in business. Let's do business. We'll have some business. Let's have business. 

JERRY

We would love to be in business. We'll do business. We're in business. It's... it's business. This is business. 

GEORGE

Yeah! 

JERRY

Your off-Broadway play. 

GEORGE

Oh, oh. Uh, you know. It's the damndest thing. I, uh, I moved recently and my files, pfff, disappeared. Now, I-I don't know if they fell off the truck or if there was some sort of foul play but let me tell you something. I'm not through with that moving company. 

JERRY

(backs his story) Hmm, hmm. 

GEORGE

That's my vow to you. 

RUSSEL

Well, I got a feeling about you two. And even more than that. I place a great deal of confidence in that lady's judgment. 

GEORGE

Oh! That's good judgment. That's a pile of judgment there. Sure. 

JERRY

Oh! Taht's judgment. Yes, yes. Judgment with earrings on. Yeah. 

RUSSEL

(gets up) So, let's make a pilot. 

NEWMAN

I had gone up to Westchester. I go there every Tuesday. I do charity for the blind in my spare time for the Lighthouse. I was in the middle of a game of Parcheesi with an old blind man and I excused myself to call my friend as he was very depressed lately because he never became a banker. 

JUDGE

I don't understand. 

NEWMAN

You see, it'd been his lifelong dream to be a banker and he uh, just the day before he was turned down by another bank. I believe it was the Manufacturer's Hanover on Lexington and 40th Street. That was the third bank to turn him down so I was-I was a little concerned. I wanted to see how he was doing. Well, Your Honor, he was barely audible. But I distinctly recall him say... 

KRAMER

(interupts involuntarily) Yo-yo Ma! 

NEWMAN

So I sped home to save my friend's life and I was stopped for speeding. Yes, I admit I was speeding but it was to save a man's life. A close friend. An innocent person who wanted nothing more out of life than to love, to be loved and to be a banker. 

JUDGE

So then he didn't kill himself. 

NEWMAN

No sir. He did not. But only by thge grace of God. He's in the courtroom today 

GEORGE

See? 

JERRY

Yeah! 

GEORGE

I told you, I told you! Ha ha ha! Ooh ooh! 

JERRY

Now, all we gotta do is write it. 

GEORGE

Yes! How're we gonna do that? 

SUSAN

Hey! Congratulations! 

JERRY

Thanks. 

GEORGE

Oh, thank you. 

JERRY

Thank you, thanks. 

GEORGE

Thanks. Gee, you know, I thought you were mad at me. 

SUSAN

No. 

JERRY

Phone call? Who knows I'm here? 

GEORGE

When you sent me the-the bill for the dry-cleaning. I thought the show didn't have a chance. 

SUSAN

Oh, it was only vomit. 

GEORGE

Anyway, I-I would like to-to pay for the cleaning. 

SUSAN

Oh no-no, it's okay. *comment from transcriber: yeah, she doesn't want to be paid, didn't she send the bill?* 

GEORGE

No-no-no, we all chipped in. We have the money. 

SUSAN

Well, it was eighteen dollars. 

GEORGE

Okay, uh, eighteen dollars, and there it is. There you go. So maybe we could get together this weekend. 

SUSAN

Yeah. Call me. 

GEORGE

All right, great. 

SUSAN

Bye. 

JERRY

Bye thanks. 

GEORGE

(chuckles) Bye, thanks. (To Jerry, when Susan is far) I can't believe she took the money. 

JERRY

Why? 

GEORGE

I offered to pay. She should've said no. 

JERRY

She did, you insisted. 

GEORGE

Maybe this is what the pilot should be about, vomiting on somebody's vest. 

JERRY

Nah! 

GEORGE

How much are we gonna get for this? Fifty, sixty thousand? 

JERRY

oh, I d-I don't know. I d--- 

GEORGE

Oh, gotta get fifty. Gotta get fifty. All right, I tell you what. We go to the coffee shop, you call your manager. Maybe they made an offer. 

JERRY

Okay. 

GEORGE

(excited, pushing Jerry forward) All right, let's go, let's go, let's go, come on. 

GEORGE

Thirteen thousand? 

JERRY

Thirteen thousand. 

GEORGE

a piece? 

JERRY

No, for both! 

GEORGE

That's insulting! Ted Danson makes eight hundred thousand dollars an episode. 

JERRY

Oh, would you stop with the Ted Danson? 

GEORGE

Well, he does. 

JERRY

You're nuts! 

GEORGE

I'm sorry. I can't live knowing Ted Danson makes that much more than me. Who is he? 

JERRY

He's somebody. 

GEORGE

What about me? 

JERRY

You're nobody. 

GEORGE

Why him? Why not me? 

JERRY

He's good, you're not. 

GEORGE

I'm better than him. 

JERRY

You're worse, much much worse. (crouches in booth) That's Davola! 

GEORGE

(crouches too) What? Where? Where? 

JERRY

Outside! I saw him outside! 

ELAINE

what is it? 

BOYFRIEND

Oh, it's this patient. 

ELAINE

(sighing) Again? 

BOYFRIEND

I'm fairly certain. I forgot to leave him an extra prescription for his medication. 

ELAINE

Well, so, he can live without his Valium for a couple of days. 

BOYFRIEND

Nah, you don't understand. He could be dangerous. 

JERRY

Go outside and see if he's still there. 

GEORGE

I can't go out there, he knows we're friends. 

JERRY

Well, what are we supposed to do? I gotta take Kramer to the doctor. 

GEORGE

Tell the cop. 

JERRY

Good idea. 

COP

Yeah, all right. Just let me get a muffin. 

JERRY

Thanks. 

JERRY

(back in booth) He's gonna get a muffin and then he'll walk us outside. This is a great way to go through life. 

GEORGE

I thought you said he was gonna get a muffin. 

JERRY

(bossy) What are you doing? 

COP

What? 

JERRY

What, are you ordering food now? 

COP

Yeah! Yeah, I decided to get a sandwich. 

JERRY

What happened to the muffin? 

COP

I got a little hungry. 

JERRY

All of a sudden you get hungry? 

COP

Yeah! You got a problem with that? 

JERRY

No! Enjoy your lunch. 

GEORGE

I thought he was just gonna have a muffin. 

JERRY

All of a sudden he gets hungry. 

GEORGE

You know, a muffin can be very filling. 

JERRY

I know! 

NEWMAN

(interrogating Kramer) Mister Kramer, you heard the testimony so far. Would you please tell the court in your own words what happened on the afternoon of September 10th? 

KRAMER

What do you mean 'my own words'? Whose words are they gonna be? 

NEWMAN

You know what I mean. 

KRAMER

(to Judge) I was very upset that day. 

NEWMAN

And why was that? 

KRAMER

(to Newman) Would you let me say it? Let me talk! 

NEWMAN

All right, all right. Go ahead, go ahead. 

KRAMER

All right. 

NEWMAN

Okay. 

KRAMER

(to Judge) I was very upset that day because I could never become a banker. 

NEWMAN

And that failure to become a banker was eating at you. Eating-eating-eating at you inside. 

KRAMER

(not convincing) Uh, yeah. 

NEWMAN

It was your family that pushed you into banking , it was their dream for you... 

JUDGE

Mister Newman. 

NEWMAN

Your Honor, I'm only trying to establish Mister Kramer's fragile emotional state, my entire case depends on it. 

JUDGE

Uh, continue. 

NEWMAN

As you were saying, Mister Kramer... 

KRAMER

What was the question? 

NEWMAN

You're telling how your parents pushed you into banking. 

KRAMER

Uh, well, my father when I was a kid, he took me to the bank and he lifted me up and he pointed to the teller and he said: 'Sonny boy, take a good look at him, that's gonna be you some day.' 

NEWMAN

But you never became a banker, did you Mister Kramer? Why? Why did you fail? 

KRAMER

I don't know. 

NEWMAN

It was because you hated your father and you would do anything to displease him. Isn't THAT true? 

JUDGE

Uh, could you get to the speeding? 

NEWMAN

Yuh, yes. I intend to Your Honor. And then, on the afternoon of September 10th, you received a phone call did you not? 

KRAMER

(puzzled) Phone call? 

NEWMAN

Yes, a phone call! 

KRAMER

From who? 

NEWMAN

From me! 

KRAMER

From you? 

NEWMAN

Yes, from me!! I called you remember? 

KRAMER

You called me? 

NEWMAN

Yes, I called you, you idiot! Because you were going to... You were going to... Remember? 

KRAMER

what? 

NEWMAN

You were going to... 

JUDGE

I'm afraid I'm gonna have to call a--- 

NEWMAN

Yes, the banker!!! 

KRAMER

What banking? 

NEWMAN

A banker! A banker! Your Honor, Your Honor, Your Honor... 

JUDGE

That's enough already. 

NEWMAN

Your Honor, Mister Kramer's obviously very distraught. 

KRAMER

I'm distraught!?! Wooh-wooh-hoo! 

NEWMAN

(to Kramer) You shut up! (to judge) I demand a recess so I can take him outside and help him regain hius composure. 

JUDGE

That'll be seventy-five dollars. 

NEWMAN

(Strangling Kramer) What's the matter with you? We had it all worked out! 

JERRY

Do you see him? 

GEORGE

I'm not* sure. 

JERRY

Well, either you see him or you don't. 

GEORGE

All right. I don't. 

JERRY

(looking at the cop) What is he doing? Is he getting coffee? I think he's getting coffee.! 

GEORGE

What's with this guy? 

JERRY

(still bossy) Did you just order coffee? 

COP

Yeah. 

JERRY

This is really too much. 

COP

What is your problem? 

JERRY

Well, I'm sitting over there waiting for you to finish your sandwich for twenty minutes. Now you're drinking coffee, that's gonna be another ten minutes. 

COP

Well, you're just gonna have to wait. 

KRAMER

Never said anything about the banking. 

NEWMAN

You're off your rocker. 

JERRY

Hey you guys! 

KRAMER

Hey! 

JERRY

What are you doing here? 

KRAMER

What are YOU doing here? 

JERRY

Hey, is Davola outside? 

KRAMER

Davola? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

KRAMER

No, I didn't see him. 

NEWMAN

Crazy Joe Davola? 

GEORGE

(reading the tabs) Jerry, yours is eleven dollars. 

JERRY

Eleven dollars for what? 

GEORGE

Muffin, sandwich and coffee! 

JERRY

(to Kramer) Hey, NBC okayed our idea. We're gonna make the pilot. 

KRAMER

You're gonna do the circus freak show, uh? 

JERRY

No. 

NEWMAN

Pilot? So what do you make for something like that? Fifty? Sixty thousand? 

GEORGE

What's the difference? The money is not important. 

JERRY

(looking outside) Hey Newman, is that your red car? 

NEWMAN

Yeah. 

JERRY

I think you're getting a ticket. 

NEWMAN

Deh! 

KRAMER

Run, run! Go, go, go! 

NEWMAN

Hey! What are you doing? It's after six o'clock! You can't give me a ticket! Hey, you're not gonna get away with this. I'll fight this. I got witnesses. 

KRAMER

I saw the whole thing! 

JERRY

Maybe this whole thing would be a good idea for the pilot. 

GEORGE

Ah, get outta here. The vomiting is much funnier. 

JERRY

Oh, like you know what you're talking about! 

GEORGE

No, YOU do! 

NOTE

Originally broadcast as part of a 60 min episode 

JERRY

So George and I went up to NBC and we told them the idea for a series now we're just waiting to sign the contract. 

HELEN

And they liked the idea? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

MORTY

What'ya got leather seats here? 

HELEN

Since when is George a writer? 

JERRY

What writer? It's a sitcom. 

HELEN

This is so exciting. When are you going to sign the contract? 

JERRY

Soon, there's a couple of problems. 

MORTY

Jerry, I wanna tell you that meal was the worst. 

JERRY

What do you expect? It's airline food. 

MORTY

They give you that *Fish.* 

JERRY

How could you eat fish on a plane? 

MORTY

because she puts up such a big stink every time I have a piece of meat. 

HELEN

What kind of problems? 

JERRY

Well, George doesn't think $13,000 is enough money. 

HELEN

What? He's not even working. 

MORTY

George is right. Those people will try to get away with murder. Believe me. They're all crooks. 

HELEN

Jerry, I want you to sign that contract. 

JERRY

We're going to sign it. We're going to sign it. In fact George is out with the woman from NBC right now. 

GEORGE

So, I'm uh, I'm afraid we're going to have to pass. 

SUSAN

Yu - you're passing? 

GEORGE

Well, it's . . . much too low. 

SUSAN

Are you and Jerry in complete agreement on this? 

GEORGE

tsh (snorts) Ah, yeah, we've - we've talked . . . I believe I can speak for the both of us on this. 

SUSAN

Well be-because you know that, because this is your first show it's a pretty standard deal. 

GEORGE

Standard? 

SUSAN

Yeah. 

GEORGE

Is Ted Danson's deal standard? 

SUSAN

Ted Danson? 

GEORGE

You know, the guy from Cheers. 

SUSAN

Yeah, I know who he is. (laughs) You're not Ted Danson. 

GEORGE

I didn't say I was Ted Danson. 

SUSAN

All right, I'll tell Russell tomorrow. 

GEORGE

You tell Russell. 

SUSAN

Oh, um, before I forget, . . . Cuban cigars. It's a present from my father. 

GEORGE

Oh... do I have to write him a note or something? 

SUSAN

Yeah, I am sure he'd appreciated that. 

GEORGE

Well what would I say in the note? 

SUSAN

Ah, you're a writer. You'll think of something. 

GEORGE

Oh-ohf (snorts) yeah, I'm a writer. (laughs) 

HELEN

Were you waiting long at the gate? 

JERRY

Um, I don't even know? 

HELEN

Where's that watch we bought you? 

JERRY

Oh uh ... 

JERRY

That's enough with this piece of junk I've had it. (throws watch in garbage) 

GEORGE

Wha-Is that the one your parents gave you? 

JERRY

Yeah, but it never works. 

JERRY

. . . it's uh, being fixed. 

MORTY

I got a guarantee on that watch. Give it to me, I'll take it back to where we got it. 

JERRY

It's at the jeweler. 

MORTY

You send me the bill. 

JERRY

I'm not sending you the bill. 

HELEN

That watch was a gift. You shouldn't have to pay for it. 

ATTENDANT

That's uh, $18.50. 

MORTY

Here, I got it. 

JERRY

What are you talking about? It's my car. Let me pay for the gas. 

MORTY

No, no put it away . . . 

JERRY

Dad! 

MORTY

Stop it. 

JERRY

I have money. I make money. 

MORTY

Yeah, yeah, you make money. 

JERRY

You don't think I make money. That's what you think isn't it? 

HELEN

No, I don't think that. 

JERRY

Yes you do. That's what you both think. 

MORTY

I'm paying. 

JERRY

Dad I'm paying. 

MORTY

Get out of here. 

JERRY

You're not paying. 

MORTY

Now Jerry please, do not do this to your father.&nbsp; Over my dead body Jerry.&nbsp; I'll tell you right now, you're not going to do it. 

JERRY

No don't do this.&nbsp; You're not doing this. I will fight you. No you don't... No. 

JERRY

Boy, you got a lot of stuff here. . . . Dad, what are you doing? 

MORTY

Nothing nothing. 

JERRY

Leave it. What about your back? 

HELEN

Morty, what are you doing? 

MORTY

All right, all right. 

JERRY

You come all the way up here to see a back specialist and you're lifting heavy suit cases. 

KRAMER

Hey, Morty. 

MORTY

Hey, Mr. Kramer. Ha ha ha. 

KRAMER

Hey, Mrs. Seinfeld. Hi 

HELEN

Ha, ha, ha Oh, What happened to you? 

KRAMER

Oh, ah, well some guy kicked me in the side of the head. 

HELEN

What guy? 

KRAMER

Ah, w-Crazy Joe Devola. 

HELEN

Why? 

KRAMER

Well, I was having this party and I didn't invite him and then Jerry, tipped him off. 

JERRY

Why did you tell this crazy guy that Kramer didn't invite him to his party? 

JERRY

I didn't know he wasn't invited. 

MORTY

Hey, these are very comfortable pants. You know what I paid for these Jerry? 

HELEN

So why did you say anything? 

JERRY

It was a mistake. 

MORTY

They're good around the house -- and they're good for outside. 

HELEN

Are you okay? 

KRAMER

Oh, yeah, yeah. I was a little off last week, huh Jerry -- Yeah but the doctor says it was just a slight concussion 

HELEN

So what's the matter with this Devola guy? 

JERRY

He's got like a chemical imbalance. He needs to be on medication. 

KRAMER

Oh, yeah, yeah. He's after Jerry now. 

JERRY

Kramer!! 

HELEN

He's what?! 

JERRY

He's joking. 

HELEN

He's after you? 

JERRY

Nooo. 

HELEN

Why is he after you? 

JERRY

He's not after me. 

HELEN

Morty, do you here this? Some crazy guy is after Jerry. 

MORTY

I'll make a few phone calls. 

JERRY

Who you gonna to call? 

MORTY

What are you worried about? 

HELEN

I want to know what you did to this guy that he's after you. 

JERRY

I didn't do anything. 

HELEN

Well you must have done something. 

JERRY

No, he just doesn't like me. 

HELEN

Doesn't like you?&nbsp; How could anyone not like you? 

JERRY

You know it seems impossible. 

HELEN

Doesn't - doesn't like you? How could that be? 

JERRY

Ma, I know this may be hard for you to understand but I am sure there are many people who do not like me. 

HELEN

Huh, Jerry, don't say that. 

JERRY

It's true. 

HELEN

No, it isn't!&nbsp; it's not true. You're a wonderful, wonderful boy. Everybody likes you. It's impossible not to like you. Impossible. Morty? 

MORTY

Maybe some people don't like him. I could see that. 

HELEN

Kramer? 

KRAMER

Yeah, I like him. Hey Jerry, what time you got? 

JERRY

Um, I haven't got my watch on. It's being fixed. 

KRAMER

When you getting it back? 

JERRY

Uh, next week. 

KRAMER

Next week? How come it's takin' so long? 

JERRY

Huh? 

KRAMER

I said how come it's takin' so long? 

JERRY

I don't know. They're, backed up. 

KRAMER

Wait a minute, wait a minute, where did you take it? 

JERRY

Where'd I take it? 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

JERRY

Where did I take it? Where Did I Take It? (stabbing a knife into a cutting board)&nbsp; Umm, to that place on, uh Columbus and 85th. Okay? 

KRAMER

What? Jimmy Sherman? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

KRAMER

Yeah, I know the guy. I take my stuff in there all the time. Yeah, I bet I can get your watch back by tomorrow morning. 

JERRY

No, Kramer, I don't want you to say anything to him. 

KRAMER

No, I'd be happy to. He's a friend of mine. 

JERRY

I'd like to follow the regular procedures. I don't want any special treatment. 

KRAMER

Hey, I'm going to get that watch back for you by tomorrow, buddy. You see. 

MORTY

Bring me the receipt. 

KRAMER

I get that too. (exits) 

JERRY

Be right back. (follows Kramer out) 

JERRY

There's no watch ... I threw it in the garbage can on the street. It didn't keep good time. My parents gave it to me, but I didn't like it.&nbsp; So don't mention it again, okay! 

KRAMER

Y-Yeah, all right. 

JERRY

All right. 

KRAMER

Wait, wait, . . .y-yea, w-no dit dit g- (Kramer noises) 

HELEN

What was that about? 

KRAMER

Oh, no, uh, he's got my Calamine lotion and uh, I told him not to return it. If he needs it he should keep it. He's got uh, he's got a thing on his ankle. 

HELEN

How can anyone not like him. 

MORTY

Hi, Morty Seinfeld. I have a two o'clock appointment. 

RECEPTIONIST

Yes, Mr. Seinfeld. Would you please fill this out. 

MORTY

All this? This whole thing? It's going to take me forty-five minutes. 

RECEPTIONIST

I know. It's very long. 

MORTY

Look at this. It's a book. Employer's address. Whydo they need this? You know I never had a back problem until that night I slept on the convertible sofa. (hu hu) My back was fine. 

HELEN

Well, it's not the sofa. 

MORTY

You stick up for that sofa like I'm criticizing a person. 

HELEN

We got it from Sullivan's. It's a good store. 

MORTY

Well one day somebody's going to sleep on that thing and we'll get sued.&nbsp; I hope this doctor knows what he's doing. 

HELEN

Leo says he's the best there is. 

MORTY

Leo, I'm listening to Leo now! 

HELEN

Well you're lucky he was able to get you this appointment. You know what the waiting list is for this guy? 

MORTY

Well, if he fixes my back I'll be happy. . . . (back to the form) Have you ever had a sexually transmitted disease? That's IT! . . . Here, you got my name, you got my address. That's enough. 

RECEPTIONIST

Julie, you want to take him back? 

JERRY

You what? You passed? How could you do that? 

GEORGE

ahhhhh (exhaling) Jerry, my young friend, you're so na&iuml;ve. You are so, so na&iuml;ve. You know about a few things. You know about comedy, a little bit about relationships, some baseball, but you are so far out of your element here, you are embarrassing yourself. Now listen to me. I'm negotiating.&nbsp; Negotiation, this is what'cha do in business. 

JERRY

Let me explain to you what you just did. There are literally hundreds of people trying to get pilot deals with them this year. They go with maybe, five. Okay, if we pass, that's it. They go to the next show. 

GEORGE

Ooooo, I'm scared. . . . Ohoooo they're not going to do the show. 

JERRY

We're lucky they're even interested in the idea in the first place. We got a show about nothing. With no story. What do you think, they're up there going, hey maybe we should give those two guys, who have no experience and no idea, more money!? 

GEORGE

Ohooo what are we going to do? I'm shaking! I'm shaking! 

JERRY

Well, I think you're wrong. 

GEORGE

Well, we'll just see. 

JERRY

Yes we will. 

GEORGE

Yes we will. 

JERRY

I just said that. 

GEORGE

I know you did. 

JERRY

So good for you. 

GEORGE

So good for you. 

JERRY

What are you repeating everything I'm saying? 

GEORGE

What are you repeating everything I'm saying? 

JERRY

Well George is an idiot. 

GEORGE

Well George . . . . 

MORTY

All right, all right, Let's go already. They keep you in here a year. They don't give a damn. I could die in here. . . .(open the door and shouts into the hallway) Excuse me! Excuse me! What's going on? I'm here twenty minutes. Could somebody please help me. 

HELEN

(enters) Shhh. Quiet! Everyone can hear you. 

MORTY

Twenty minutes. I've been waiting twenty minutes. 

HELEN

Well the doctor must be busy. 

MORTY

Well then what do they make appointments for if they can't keep them. Huh, hha. Look if I did that in my business I wouldn't have made a nickel. 

NURSE

Hello, Mr. Seinfeld. 

MORTY

I thought you forgot about me. 

NURSE

We didn't forget. 

MORTY

HaAhhh! The Velcro. I can't stand Velcro. It's that t-e-a-r-I-n-g sound. I used to be in raincoats. I refused to put that in any of my lines. 

NURSE

Okay, Mr. Seinfeld, please come this way. We need some X-rays. 

MORTY

Leave all my stuff here? 

NURSE

Leave it. 

GEORGE

Oh hey, by the way. Do you want a box 'a, Cuban cigars? I smoked one last night. I got nauseous. 

JERRY

No I don't want ?em. 

KRAMER

I'll take it. No, I'll take it. What is it? 

GEORGE

Here you go. 

KRAMER

Cigars? (hits the box) 

GEORGE

Yeah, Cubans. 

KRAMER

Oh, yeah? 

GEORGE

Yeah, the kind that Castro smoked. You can't buy ?em anywhere. 

KRAMER

Castro eh? Pasto costillo homiga (nonsense Spanish) 

JERRY

Yeah? 

VOICE

Federal Express. 

JERRY

Federal Express? Come on up. . . . Federal Express. I'm not expecting a package. 

KRAMER

Wooo, you know what you just did? You let a burglar in the building. 

JERRY

You think so? 

KRAMER

Federal Express? Of course. That's the oldest trick in the book. You know it might not be a burglar it could be a murderer. 

JERRY

So you want to just abolish all home package deliveries. 

KRAMER

Yes. It's dangerous. 

KRAMER

wait det doit ... dit&nbsp; (Kramer noises -- he prepares for a fight by rolling up a magazine) 

JERRY

Who is it? 

KRAMER

Okay, ... gidg gi gt&nbsp; (backs up and bends his knees, holding the rolled magazine - arm back, ready for a rumble) 

ALL

Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii! 

KRAMER

I want one of those! 

ELAINE

Hiiii Kramer 

KRAMER

Oh yes 

ELAINE

Kramer, Hi, I thought you went to California. 

KRAMER

Well I came back for you. 

ELAINE

Oh, shut up (pushes Kramer) 

JERRY

I missed you. 

ELAINE

Really? You really missed me? 

JERRY

Yeah, . . . seriously. 

GEORGE

Yeah, yeah, me to miss -- I miss. 

JERRY

Yeah, big missing goin' on (spreads arms wide) 

ELAINE

Ahhhhhh haa ha ha 

KRAMER

Hey, I'm going to be right back. I'm going to get a match. 

ELAINE

Oh god, Who's suitcase is this? 

JERRY

Oh, it's my parents. My father came up to see a back specialist. 

ELAINE

Oh, god, it's probably from sleeping on that sofa. 

GEORGE

Boy, you look really great. 

JERRY

Yeah. 

ELAINE

You lie. 

GEORGE

No, no you really look great. 

ELAINE

Hu hu, ha ha ha. 

JERRY

So tell us about the trip. How's Dr. Reston? 

ELAINE

Oh, he's fine. 

JERRY

Things are good? 

ELAINE

Yeah, you know (scratches cheek and sniffs) 

JERRY

Uh oh. 

ELAINE

What, Uh oh? 

JERRY

Did you see that? 

GEORGE

Yeah, I saw it. 

ELAINE

What? 

JERRY

It's a tell. You gotta tell. 

ELAINE

What tell? What's a tell? 

JERRY

When you ask someone about their relationship and they touch their face, you know it's not going too well. Go ahead ask me how it's going with somebody. 

ELAINE

Um, uh, who's it going with, uh, Alice? 

JERRY

Good, going good (scratches chin) And the higher up on the face you go the worse the relationship is getting. You know it is like - pretty good - not bad - I gotta get out.&nbsp; (scratches chin, nose then covers eyes with hands) 

ELAINE

How high did I go? 

GEORGE

You almost did the nose. 

JERRY

What are you eating my peanut butter out of the jar with your disgusting index fingers? This is a sickening display. (takes the peanut butter jar away from George) 

GEORGE

What? I'm not eating bread now. I'm off bread. 

JERRY

(To George) You're off bread.&nbsp; (To Elaine) So what happened is it over? 

ELAINE

No not quite. 

JERRY

Why not? 

ELAINE

Well he was my psychiatrist, you know. I mean, he knows all my patterns. He knows In relationships that I always try to find some reason to leave, and so, he says as my doctor, he can't allow me to do this, so he's not letting me leave. 

GEORGE

What do you mean - 'Not letting you?' 

ELAINE

He has this power over me, okay. I mean he has this way of manipulating every little word that I say. He's like a Svenjolly. 

JERRY

Svengali. 

ELAINE

What did I say? 

JERRY

Svenjolly. 

ELAINE

Svenjolly? I did not say Svenjolly. 

JERRY

George? 

GEORGE

Svenjolly. (licking a little bit of peanut butter from his finger) 

ELAINE

I don't see how I could have said Svenjolly. 

JERRY

Well maybe he's got like a, cheerful mental hold on you. 

KRAMER

You know I can't find a match anywhere. 

GEORGE

You know what you should do? You should tell this guy you're seeing&nbsp; somebody else. That's the easiest way to get out of these things. 

ELAINE

No, it's not going to work with this guy. 

GEORGE

No, you just tell him ah, an old boyfriend has come back into your life. 

ELAINE

I don't think so. 

JERRY

Nice try. 

GEORGE

Took a shot. 

KRAMER

This is a good cigar (hair is on fire, white smoke pouring from the back of his head) . . . . . . WOOOOOOOOOOW . . . (runs to bathroom, his arms in the air -- he bangs them in to the top of the hallway door jam and falls into the bathroom) 

MORTY

So, when do I get to see the doctor? 

NURSE

He'll be in with the X-Rays in a few minutes. You can get dressed. (leaves) 

MORTY

(checking pants) They stole my wallet. The bum stole my wallet. (opens door, shouts into the hallway) MY WALLET'S GONE!&nbsp; MY WALLET'S GONE! I had my wallet in my back pocket. It's gone. 

NURSE

Are you sure? 

MORTY

Yes, I'm sure. I went in to get my X-Ray, Somebody takes my wallet. Is that the operation here? 

DEMBROW

Mr. Seinfeld, I'm Dr. Dembrow, I've been going over your X-rays. 

MORTY

I'm not interested in the X-Rays. I want my money back. Somebody stole my wallet. I had $225 in there. 

DEMBROW

Well, I don't see how something like that could have happened. 

MORTY

Oh, you don't see. You don't see. Well it happened. Believe me. 

HELEN

(enters) What's going on? 

MORTY

They stole my wallet. 

HELEN

What? 

MORTY

Yeah, while I was in getting X-Rayed. 

DEMBROW

All right, Mr. Seinfeld, I am sorry about your wallet but would you like me to look over these X-Rays? 

MORTY

What kind of clip joint are ya running here? 

DEMBROW

All right, fine. (leaves) 

HELEN

The least you could have done was heard your diagnosis. 

MORTY

I am not interested in his diagnosis. He's a bum. 

HELEN

You came all the way from Florida to see him. 

MORTY

I want to know what kind of an office this is where you can't leave your pants in the room. You tell me. 

ELAINE

I'm sorry but there's somebody else. 

RESTON

Umm hm. 

ELAINE

Well it's, nothing I planned on happening, you know. It just, kind of happened. 

RESTON

Tell me about him. 

ELAINE

Well, there's not really much to tell, you know, he's just a guy, Really. 

RESTON

Yes, well I assumed he's a guy. 

ELAINE

Right... 

RESTON

And you've known him how long? 

ELAINE

. . . Years. Many years (her voice cracks), um, (clears throat) we've been close friends and then recently something just you know *ehghh* happened. 

RESTON

You mean sexually? 

ELAINE

Yeah, yeah. Sexu-ally. 

ELAINE

I think your um ... (points at the phone) 

RESTON

Excuse me. Yes, Oh yes, Bobo.&nbsp; Uh, no it's just east of Madison. Around 4:00 will be fine. All right Bobo ... see you then. (hangs up) . . . I'm sorry where were we? 

ELAINE

Well, I was just um, telling you about this, other guy. 

RESTON

Mm. Elaine ... 

ELAINE

Yeah 

RESTON

Do you remember your dream, where you have a sexual encounter with a Chinese woman? 

ELAINE

Yeah. Yeah, (cough, cough) Mm-hm. 

RESTON

Elaine, I'm concerned about you. 

ELAINE

Oh, no no no no, don't concern yourself with me, because I'm - I'm good. I'm - I'm very good, I mean I'm really very, very good. 

RESTON

Elaine. Have you been urinating a lot again? 

ELAINE

. . . no. 

RESTON

And how often have you been seeing, um . . .? I'm sorry what is his name? 

ELAINE

H-his name? 

RESTON

Yes, his name. 

ELAINE

Um, well what's the difference? 

RESTON

Are you afraid to tell me his name? 

ELAINE

No, no, I just - I just don't see how that's relevant. 

RESTON

It doesn't matter if you don't see how. I see how. 

ELAINE

Uh, his name, um, I don't&nbsp; - I don't even know, all right you want to know his name? I'll - I'll tell you his name. His name is . . . Kramer. 

RESTON

Kramer. Is that his first name or his last name? 

ELAINE

Oh, I'm - I'm really uncomfortable talking about this. 

RESTON

Elaine, I want you to do me a favor. 

ELAINE

What? 

RESTON

I want you to tell this young man to give me a call. It's very important that I speak to him. 

ELAINE

Oh, oh no, no no no, I can't do that. 

RESTON

You can do it and you will do it. 

ELAINE

No, I can't. 

RESTON

You can and you will. 

ELAINE

Okay, okay.&nbsp; Yeah I'll have Kramer give you a call. 

JERRY

So you didn't even let the doctor treat you? 

MORTY

I wouldn't give him the satisfaction. 

HELEN

Why did you leave your wallet in your pants? 

MORTY

What are you talking about? What was I supposed to hide it somewhere? 

HELEN

You could've taken it with you. 

MORTY

Oh, yeah, I'll be lying on an X-Ray table with my wallet in my mouth. 

LEO

Hello... 

JERRY

Hi Uncle Leo. 

LEO

I just talked to Dr. Dembrow's son. He said they almost had to call the police. 

MORTY

What are you talking about? I'm the one who should have called the police. They stole my wallet. 

LEO

You know how hard it was for me to get that appointment for you? You can't just walk in on this guy. He did me a personal favor. 

MORTY

All right, Leo. 

LEO

And you walked out without paying. 

MORTY

How was I supposed to pay? I didn't have my wallet. 

LEO

Well, I hope you send him a check. 

MORTY

What for? 

LEO

What for? This man was nice enough to see you. He did me a personal favor. 

MORTY

That's the second time you said 'personal favor'. Why do you keep saying that? 

LEO

I said it once. 

MORTY

Twice! And Dembrow doesn't even know you. His son happens to live on your floor. 

HELEN

Leo, where did you get that watch? 

LEO

You know where I got this? (flashback) I found it in the garbage can. It kept terrible time. I brought it over to Jimmy Sherman right here on 85th and Columbus. Gave it to me back the next day. Works great. What kind of idiot throws a way a perfectly good watch? 

HELEN

Morty, doesn't that watch look like the one that we gave Jerry. 

JERRY

Hey, where's the waiter. Dad, what say we have some red meat tonight. Let's live a little. . 

HELEN

Let me see that. 

JERRY

Could we continue this another time. 

NOTE

Originally broadcast as part of a 60 min episode. 

JERRY

It's an entire industry of bad gifts, aren't they? All those executive gifts, any stupid, goofy, brass, wood thing, they put a piece of green felt on the bottom. 'It's a golf, desk, tie and stress organiser, dad.' But to me, nothing compares with the paperweight as a bad gift. There's no better way than a paperweight, to express to someone that, 'I refuse to put any thought into this at all.' Where are these people working that the papers are just blowing right off of their desks? What, are their desks screwed to the back of a flat-bed truck going down the highway or something? What, are they typing up in the crow's nest of a clipper ship? What do you need a paperweight for? 

MORTY

(to Leo) I don't understand this jeweller, Jimmy Sherman. (indicates Jerry) He brings in a watch, it takes over a week to fix. He fixed yours in one day. 

JERRY

Oh, you know these jewellers, they're enigmas. They're mysteries, wrapped in a riddle. 

HELEN

(indicating to Jerry) She's very attractive. 

JERRY

She's okay. 

HELEN

Just okay? 

JERRY

She's nice. 

HELEN

She's better than nice. 

JERRY

She's all right. 

HELEN

She's beautiful. 

JERRY

She's not beautiful. 

HELEN

I think she's beautiful. 

JERRY

So you ask her out. 

HELEN

I'm not gonna ask her out. 

JERRY

Why not? 

HELEN

If you don't think she's beautiful, there's something wrong with you. 

JERRY

She's pretty. She's not beautiful. 

HELEN

I should drop dead if she's not beautiful. 

JERRY

I think that's a little extreme. 

LEO

(grudgingly) She's awright. 

MORTY

(oblivious to the above) Two exact same watches. He tells you a week, and him a day. How could that be? Something's fishy about this. 

GEORGE

He said what? 

SUSAN

'The hell with them.' 

GEORGE

'The hell with them?' 

SUSAN

Those were his exact words. 

GEORGE

(worried) Oh boy. 

SUSAN

He said, 'We've got five hundred shows to choose from. Why should we give two guys, who have no idea, and no experience, more money?' 

GEORGE

(still worried) He was pretty emphatic? 

SUSAN

Pounded on his desk. 

GEORGE

Pounded? 

SUSAN

(tossing her purse on the dash) I told you to take the offer. 

GEORGE

(getting animated) Look I, I uh, I had nothing to do with this. It wasn't my decision. It was Jerry! Jerry told me no. I'm the creative guy. He handles the business end. 

SUSAN

You said it was insulting. 

GEORGE

I was quoting him. Why would I be insulted? I'm never insulted. You could call me baldy, dump soup on my head. Nothing insults me. 

SUSAN

Well, there's nothing I can do. 

GEORGE

Well, don't they make a counter offer? How can they just cancel the whole deal like that? What kind of a maniac is this guy? I mean he just, he says no, and that's it? 

SUSAN

Yeah, that's the way Russell is. He doesn't like to play games. 

GEORGE

Well, he has to play! He can't just not play. We're playing! Look, I gotta see him, how do I get in touch with him? 

SUSAN

You'll have to wait til Monday. 

GEORGE

Mon...? No, no, I can't wait til Monday, that's impossible, I gotta talk to him now. Where does he live? 

SUSAN

(laugh) I can't give you his address. 

SUSAN

Give it back! 

GEORGE

Gimme the purse! 

ELAINE

Okay, so he just wants to talk to you. I couldn't talk him out of it. So you just tell him that you're my boyfriend and that we're in love, okay. Can you do that? 

KRAMER

Yeah, yeah, okay. I'm your boyfriend. 

ELAINE

Okay. 

KRAMER

Have we been intimate? 

ELAINE

Yeah. Yeah, we've been intimate. 

KRAMER

Alright, how often do we do it? 

ELAINE

Kramer, how is that important? Honestly, do you really think he's gonna ask you that? 

KRAMER

Elaine, he's a psychiatrist. They're interested in stuff like that. 

ELAINE

Alright, alright. We do it, uh... (thinks) five times a week, okay? 

KRAMER

(suggestive) Oooh, baby. (smiles) 

ELAINE

Oh, man. Alright, listen. Just tell me something, what are you gonna say? 

KRAMER

I know what I'm gonna say. 

ELAINE

No, no, but I would like to hear it. 

KRAMER

No, no. I don't wanna say it out loud. Kills the spontaneity. You know, Gleason, he never rehearsed. (indicates phone) 'Kay, go 'head, do it. 

ELAINE

(dialling) Alright, okay. You talk to him. 

KRAMER

(playing with his hair) Talk to him. 

ELAINE

Hey, how's your hair? 

KRAMER

Oh, well, yeah, it's good. 

ELAINE

(handing over the phone) You're not the type that should be playing with matches, seriously Kramer. 

KRAMER

(listens) Uh, yes. Uh uh, Doctor uh, Reston, is he in? Well, this is Kramer and uh, he's expecting my call. 

ELAINE

(mouths silently) Okay. 

KRAMER

(singing) ...Johnny ...was a rebel. He rode through the land... 

KRAMER

...Yu uh, yes, yes uh, uh, Doctor Reston. Uhm well, hello there. Ahh yeah, well, I'm a good friend of Elaine's... 

ELAINE

(animated, but quietly) No, no. Not friends. 

KRAMER

...Well, actually uh, we're uh, we're not friends Uh, we're uh, we're much more than friends... 

KRAMER

...and uh, I'm afraid we have a bit of a problem. Well, the point is, doctor uh, I'm very much in love with Elaine... 

KRAMER

...and uh, she's very much in love with me, and uh, well uh, we would uh, appreciate it if you would cease and desist, and allow us to pursue our courtship unfettered. 

ELAINE

(mouths silently) That's perfect! 

KRAMER

If not, I can assure you, doctor, that I can make things very unpleasant for you and your staff. If you have one. 

KRAMER

Yes. Yeah, but the point that I... (listens) 

KRAMER

...Ah, ye... (listens) Well, no... Uh, yeah, that's possible... 

KRAMER

(listens) ...Well, I suppose I could, (turns away from Elaine) but I'd have to shift a few things around, uhm... Hold on for a second, will you? Uh... 

KRAMER

... Uh, go ahead, yeah. (listens and makes a note) Alright uh... Yeah, yeah, okay... I look forward to it too. (listens) Eh, hah, okay. So long. 

ELAINE

What happened? What'd he say? (indicates pad) What's going on here? 

KRAMER

Uh, okay now. He uh, you know, he uh, wants to get together. 

ELAINE

(horrified) Get together!! 

KRAMER

He wants to talk. 

ELAINE

Well, why didn't you say no!! 

KRAMER

(momentary confusion) Wha...? Uh... (thoughtful) That's interesting. 

ELAINE

(frustration) Ugh! 

NAOMI

Did you enjoy your poisson? 

HELEN

It was... different. 

NAOMI

(to Jerry) And how was yours? 

JERRY

Ah, very good. 

NAOMI

You should try our mousse. (a little flirtatious) It'll change your life expectancy. 

JERRY

No thanks, just the check. 

HELEN

What's the matter with you? 

JERRY

What? 

HELEN

Why didn't you flirt with her? 

JERRY

Come on. 

HELEN

She was flirting with you. Why didn't you say something? 

JERRY

What am I gonna say? 

HELEN

You just sat there. 

JERRY

Well, you made me uncomfortable. 

HELEN

You're a comedian, couldn't you come up with something? 

LEO

(to Morty) Where's the bathroom? 

JERRY

In the back, on your right. 

JERRY

Dad! 

MORTY

Will you stop it Jerry. Let go. 

HELEN

Jerry. 

JERRY

Will you let me pay just once. 

MORTY

You're out of your mind. 

JERRY

How you gonna pay? You don't even have a wallet! 

MORTY

Don't worry about it. 

JERRY

What're you gonna do? 

MORTY

What's the difference, we'll figure something out. 

HELEN

(to Jerry) You're not paying. 

JERRY

Alright, fine. You figure something out. I'd be very curious to know how you pick up a check with no money. 'Cause if this works, the whole monetary system's obsolete, we're back to wampum. (standing) I'm going to the bathroom. 

MORTY

How the hell am I gonna pay for this? 

LEO

They give you some portion here, huh? 

JERRY

Uh, yeah. (broaching a subject) Hey uncle Leo, I hope I wasn't uh, rude to you that day I bumped into you on the street. Uh, I really did have to get to a meeting. 

LEO

(preening himself in the mirror) Aw, no, no, I understand. I got plenty of friends in showbusiness. I know you're all very busy. 

JERRY

So you found that watch in the garbage can, huh? 

LEO

Yeah. In fact it was right after I ran into you. 

JERRY

Oh, heh. You know, a friend of mine has a watch just like that. I'd love to replace it for him as a gift. 

LEO

Well, I haven't seen too many like (indicating watch) these. 

JERRY

Yeah, I know. Maybe uh, you wanna sell me that one. 

LEO

(sarcastic) Aww, sure. (laughter) 

JERRY

(pulling Leo back in) Hang on a second. I got a little proposition for you. 

DOORMAN

(into phone) There's a George Bonanza to see you. 

GEORGE

Costanza. Costanza. 

DOORMAN

(into phone) George Costanza. 

GEORGE

The guy who pitched him the show with the stories about nothing. (snaps fingers) Jerry Seinfeld. Jerry Seinfeld's friend. 

DOORMAN

(into phone) Seinfeld friend. (he listens) (to George) He says, call him Monday. 

GEORGE

(into phone, frantic) Mister Dalrimple! Mister Dalrimple I have to talk to you! 

DOORMAN

Excuse me. 

GEORGE

It's about the show. It... No, it was... 

DOORMAN

Excuse me. 

GEORGE

...It was all a terrible misunderstanding, sir. Just five minutes. Just five minutes of your time. (listens) Thank you! Thank you, Mister Dalrimple. 

DOORMAN

(into phone) Very good, sir. 

MORTY

You don't understand. I can't allow my son to pay for me. Look, as soon as I get back to Florida, I promise you I'll mail you a check. 

MORTY

No, no, he won't let me do that. 

MORTY

He could wash them. 

MORTY

Don't tell me about business! I sold raincoats for thirty-five years! 

MORTY

You don't understand my... 

ELAINE

Now look, don't take too long. 

KRAMER

(looking around) Look at this building. What is this? 

ELAINE

I don't know. It's a building. 

KRAMER

(indicating) The door's on a diagonal. 

ELAINE

So what? 

KRAMER

(looking around) It's architecturally incorrect. 

ELAINE

(frustrated) Just go. 

GEORGE

(sidling in) Is this a bad time? I hope I'm not disturbing anything. 

RUSSELL

We were about to sit down to dinner. 

RUSSELL

(indicating) This is Cynthia. 

GEORGE

(entering the apartment more fully) Oh. Oh, hi, hi. Hi. Nice to meet you. (peering at the table) What're you having, veal? 

RUSSELL

No. 

GEORGE

Looks like veal. 

RUSSELL

It's not veal. 

GEORGE

Well, it's a good looking piece of meat. (laughs nervously) Wow, this is some place. A duplex, huh? (indicating) Look at this, you got stairs in an apartment. All my life, I dreamed about having steps in an apartment. Even one step. Sunken living room. Although, one step is really not all that sunken. (tries hard to elicit a laugh) 

RUSSELL

Who gave you my address? 

GEORGE

No, that's a fair question. It is, uhm... (nervous chuckle) Jerry, yeah. (to Cynthia) Jerry's a friend of mine. (to Russell) He uh, he gave it to me. Unbelievable how many addresses of people this guy has. 

GEORGE

He's got Marlon Brando's. I could go to Marlon Brando's house if I really wanted. 

GEORGE

Course, I wouldn't, I mean uh, the guy is uh, well obviously (to Cynthia, as she passes) the guy has his problems. 

RUSSELL

So, what's the surprise? You wanna talk about the show? 

GEORGE

Well, you know, it's really very funny, because you know what we got here, really? We really, really, just have a terrible misunderstanding. You see, when I passed on the deal, I thought that's what Jerry wanted me to say. Y'know, I, I misinterpreted. 

CYNTHIA

(bored) Russell, where's the TV Guide. 

GEORGE

Oh, what time is it? Eight thirty? I'll tell you what's on. You got Major Dad, Blossom, very funny programme... 

RUSSELL

Blossom's on Monday. 

GEORGE

Are you sure? Oh, look who I'm talking to. The president of NBC. (forced laughter) 

RUSSELL

Look Mister Costanza, it's too late now anyway. I already made a deal with another writing team. 

GEORGE

(worried) Alright, alright. Look, we're people, you and me, huh?&nbsp; Businessmen. Colleagues, if I may. Let's not quibble. We'll do it for the thirteen thousand. Thirteen thousand, and I never came up here, we never talked, alright. You take good care. (moving past Russell toward the door) It was nice seeing you again, and nice meeting you. (to Cynthia) Cynthia, right? 

RUSSELL

Alright, now look. These deals are already made. 

GEORGE

Awright, lemme just say this. Ten thousand dollars, alright, and now I'm going below what you wanted to pay. You have your dinner, have your veal, or whatever it is. Enjoy... 

RUSSELL

Mister Costanza. 

GEORGE

Alright, that's it. Alright, good, eight thousand dollars. (to Cynthia) Cynthia, again, nice meeting you. Have I commented on the shoes? I love suede, it's so thick and rich. Did you ever, you ever rub it against the grain? Alright, anyway... 

CYNTHIA

(bored, frustrated) Russell, can we eat? 

RUSSELL

(to George) Alright. Eight thousand. 

GEORGE

(pleased) You've made Jerry very happy. 

GEORGE

May I just use your bathroom for a moment? 

JERRY

Alright, two hundred, but that's as high as I can go. I really think you're being unreasonable here! 

LEO

Jerry, I'd give you the watch. It's not the money, I happen to like it. 

JERRY

Look, I happen to know how much that watch cost. It's a sixty dollar watch, you paid forty to get it fixed. That's a hundred dollars. I'm offering you two hundred! 

LEO

(indicating) I've never seen a band like this. 

JERRY

Aww, right. Three hundred, plus fifty for the repair. Three fifty, that's it! 

LEO

You have it on you? 

JERRY

Yeah, I think I do. 

JERRY

(under his breath) This is unbelievable. 

MORTY

What the hell is going on here? 

KRAMER

Well, it uh, (offering his hand) it's a pleasure to meet you. 

RESTON

(shaking hands) Thank you for coming in. 

KRAMER

Thank you. 

RESTON

Please, sit down. 

KRAMER

(quiet) Okay. 

RESTON

Could I offer you something to drink. Uhm, coffee? Anything? 

KRAMER

Okay uh, yeah. I'll have a uh, you have a decaf cappuccino? 

RESTON

I don't think we have that. 

KRAMER

Well, that's a little strange. 

RESTON

Uh, why does that surprise you? 

KRAMER

Well, it's uh, it's a very popular drink 

RESTON

This is an office. 

KRAMER

That's true. But, you know, I can't help but think that uh... 

RESTON

(interrupting) So tell me Mister Kramer... 

KRAMER

...Okay, yes, shoot. 

RESTON

Tell me all about uh, you and Elaine. 

KRAMER

Oh, alrighty uh... 

KRAMER

Well, what we have here, doctor, is uhm, an extraordinary situation. 

RESTON

Is it? 

KRAMER

Oh, you better believe it. 

DAVOLA

(singing) '...Travelling along...' 

DAVOLA

'...singing a song, side by side...' 

ELAINE

Wow. You really have a terrible voice. 

DAVOLA

Do I know you? 

ELAINE

Uhh, I don't think so. 

DAVOLA

'Cos you really look familiar. 

ELAINE

Oh, well maybe you've seen me. My face is on uhm, Mount 

DAVOLA

Oh yes, of course, that's it. I guess I'm just used to seeing it on a much larger scale. 

ELAINE

Oh yeah, right. I replaced uh, Teddy Roosevelt. 

DAVOLA

Oh really. 

ELAINE

Umm. Trustbuster. Bust this. 

KRAMER

You know, I never thought of it like that before, doctor. (points) You, are absolutely right. 

RESTON

I'm glad we agree. 

KRAMER

(reaching in pocket) Hey, would you like a cigar? Y'know, they're Cubans. 

RESTON

I'd love one. 

KRAMER

Yeah. You know, I think Elaine is a wonderful woman. You two are gonna make a wonderful couple. 

RESTON

If you ever feel, a need to talk to someone... 

KRAMER

(lighting Dr Reston's cigar) Uh huh. 

RESTON

...About anything. You have my number. 

KRAMER

(lighting his own cigar) Well, that's very kind of you. 

KRAMER

Mmm, these are good, huh? 

KRAMER

(quiet) Oh. 

ELAINE

I cannot believe I'm doing this. I never meet people like this. You're not a nut, are you? 

DAVOLA

No, I don't think so. 

JERRY

I can't believe I'm doing this. I never do stuff like this. 

NAOMI

(joking) Really? I give out my number to just about every customer who comes in here. 

JERRY

Oh. (chuckles) Really? You don't seem that desperate. 

NAOMI

(playing it straight) Oh yeah. Actually, I'm a little disappointed. I kind of had my eye on uncle Leo. 

JERRY

Uh huh. Well uh, I'll give you a call, and thanks for the fish. By the way, you know why fish are so thin? 

NAOMI

Why? 

JERRY

They eat fish. 

KRAMER

Hey. 

ELAINE

What happened? What took you so long? 

KRAMER

Hey, he's a terrific guy. 

ELAINE

Wha...? What are you talking about? What'd he say? 

KRAMER

Well, we talked about a lot of things. 

ELAINE

You talked about a lot of things? Well... 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

ELAINE

Did you talk about us? 

DAVOLA

I'm in love. I just met her outside in the street. Her 

RESTON

Did you say Elaine? 

JERRY

How come the psychiatrist, every, the hour is only fifty minutes? Wha, what do they do with that ten minutes that they have left? Do they just sit there going, 'Boy, that guy was crazy. I couldn't believe the things he was saying. What a nut! Who's coming in next? Oh, no, another headcase!' 

MORTY

You shoulda told me it didn't work. 

JERRY

I know, I know. 

HELEN

You didn't have to throw it out. 

JERRY

I was always late. It was frustrating me. I'm sorry, I really am. 

HELEN

Oh, that must be Leo. 

JERRY

I woulda taken you to the airport. 

HELEN

He has nothing to do. 

JERRY

Neither do I. (to intercom) Yeah? 

GEORGE

It's George. 

JERRY

Come on up. (to parents) It's George. 

MORTY

Oh, it's George. 

HELEN

What ever happened with NBC and the deal? 

JERRY

Ah, George turned it down. 

HELEN

He turned it down? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

HELEN

Why did he do that? 

JERRY

Because of Ted Danson. 

HELEN

What does Ted Danson have to do with it? 

MORTY

Maybe he doesn't like Ted Danson. 

JERRY

(fetching a drink from the fridge) Hey, who knows, maybe we'll wind up getting more money. 

GEORGE

(to Jerry) Hey. 

MORTY

Hey, Georgie-boy, how are ya? 

GEORGE

Hey, Mr Seinfeld. (shakes Morty's hand) Hey, Mrs Seinfeld. How are you? 

HELEN

What's the matter with you? 

GEORGE

What'd I do? 

JERRY

What about NBC? Did you hear anything? 

GEORGE

Yeah, as a matter of fact, I did. 

GEORGE

We got a deal. 

JERRY

(simultaneous) Hey!/That's wonderful!/We got a deal! 

JERRY

Heyy! Terrific. 

MORTY

You see, he had the right idea. Hold out. That's how you get the big money, huh George? (slaps George on the shoulder) 

GEORGE

Uh, please, Morty. 

MORTY

No, no, no. He knows how to talk to these people. No-one's gonna take advantage of Georgie. (slaps George's shoulder again) 

GEORGE

I'm just happy to be working with your talented son... 

JERRY

Aww... 

GEORGE

...Who's not doing this for the money. 

JERRY

...C'mon. 

GEORGE

You have no idea how refreshing that is. 

JERRY

So what'd we get? 

GEORGE

(big smile) Eight thousand dollars. 

JERRY

Beautiful! 

GEORGE

(quietly) That's uh, for the two of us. 

HELEN

Four thousand apiece? 

JERRY

Lemme see if I understand this. In other words, you held out 

GEORGE

I was wrong, you were right. 

JERRY

You know, the basic idea of negotiation, as I understand it, is to get your price to go... up. 

GEORGE

You're smart, I'm dumb. 

JERRY

You know, this is how they negotiate in the bizarro world. 

HELEN

That's gotta be Leo. 

JERRY

(to intercom) Yeah? 

LEO

Leo. 

JERRY

Alright, we're coming down. 

MORTY

Alright, let's get going. 

JERRY

Dad, before we go, I got a little something for you. 

JERRY

A present. 

MORTY

A present? 

MORTY

Hey! Look at this, a wallet. Exactly what I needed, y'see. 

JERRY

C'mon, you lost your wallet, I figured I'd get you another one. 

HELEN

I hope you didn't spend too much on that. 

MORTY

I wanna tell you. This is one of the most thoughtful gifts anyone's ever given me. 

HELEN

He's something, you son, isn't he? 

JERRY

Ah hah, alright, let's go. 

MORTY

You're a terrific kid. 

JERRY

Okay. 

GEORGE

Yeah, he's something, isn't he? 

HELEN

How could anybody not like you? 

GEORGE

(to Jerry) You're very special. 

JERRY

(pointedly) Yeah, I'm good for about four thousand dollars. 

LEO

Hey, let's go! It's twelve (checks watch) uh, twelve twenty-two. 

MORTY

Alright, Leo. 

JERRY

Hey, uncle Leo. 

LEO

Hi, hi... 

JERRY

How you doing? 

JERRY

This is some beautiful parking spot you got here. 

LEO

Yeah, I hate to give it up. 

JERRY

Yeah. Hey, dad, you sure you don't need any more money? 

MORTY

Jerry! 

JERRY

Alright, I'm just joking. Listen, have a nice trip. 

HELEN

(hugging Jerry) Bye bye, Jerry. 

GEORGE

Bye Mrs Seinfeld, take care. 

MORTY

Bye bye. (hugging Jerry) Thanks again for the wallet. 

GEORGE

(shaking hands with Morty) Morty, always a pleasure. 

JERRY

Take care now. So long. 

GEORGE

Yeah, like he was really gonna take your money. 

JERRY

Oh, he took it. I put four hundred dollars in the new wallet. 

GEORGE

You're kidding. 

JERRY

He lost all that cash. It was the only way I could give it back to him, otherwise he wouldn't accept it. 

GEORGE

Man, would I like to see the look on his face. 

MORTY

You believe this? 

HELEN

What? 

MORTY

(indicates the new wallet) It's velcro. 

HELEN

You're kidding. 

MORTY

Who needs this? 

MORTY

Leo, let's go. 

JERRY

...main difference between the women's wallet and the man's wallet, is the photo section. True? Women carry with them a photograph of every person they've ever met, every day in their whole lives, since the beginning of time. And every picture is out of date. You know what I mean? It's, 'Here's my cousin, three years old. She's in the marines now.' 'This is my dog. He died during the Johnson administration.' You know. You get stopped by a cop, no licence, no registration, (waves imaginary wallet) 'Here's fifty-six people that know me.' Cop goes. 'Alright, ma'am, just wanted to make sure you had some friends, move it along. Routine pal check.' 

JERRY

Have you ever called someone up, and you're disappointed when they answer the phone?&nbsp; You wanted the machine.&nbsp; You know, and you're always kind of thrown off, (left hand up to side of face, pretending its a receiver) you go 'Oh, I eh, I - I didn't know you were there, I ah - just wanted to leave a message saying, sorry I missed you.' 

JERRY

Well this is it. 

NAOMI

Oh, this is nice. Thanks again for the Chinese food. 

JERRY

Oh, you're welcome. You know I think I ate too much of that garlic. 

NAOMI

Yeah, me too. 

JERRY

No, I ate the whole plate. I didn't know those little things were garlic. I thought they were peanuts. 

NAOMI

(laughs) - Nnnhhahahahahahahahahahahahahaha (obnoxious laugh). Oh, you know what? I think Naked Gun is on. Oh I've seen it. I laughed through that whole thing. You wanna watch? 

JERRY

No, I mean, I don't think so. 

NAOMI

I thought you liked to laugh. I thought you were happy go lucky. 

JERRY

No, no, no. I'm not happy, I'm not lucky, and I don't go. If anything I'm sad stop unlucky. 

NAOMI

Ahahahahahahahahaha. 

JERRY

That's not funny Naomi. 

NAOMI

Ah hahahaha. (points at Jerry) 

JERRY

I didn't mean to be funny there. Why don't you check the TV guide. I think uh, Holocaust is on. 

GEORGE

(on the answering machine) Jerry, it's George. Hey, hey are you all set for the weekend. This is going to be great. You're going to have a great time with Naomi. 

GEORGE

(con't) All right, you know she's got that laugh. What did you say? It's like Elmer Fudd sitting on a juicer? 

GEORGE

(con't) A-Anyway, I was thinking we would take two cars up to the cabin and that way if one of wanted to stay you know... 

JERRY

This thing has never worked right. (holding the machine in his hand) 

NAOMI

You think I, laugh like Elmer Fudd sitting on a juicer? 

JERRY

Well, first of all Elmer Fudd is one of the most beloved internationally known cartoon characters of all time. 'I'm going to kill that cwazy wabbit ... hahahahahaaa ' Come on. Not only that, a juicer is one of the healthiest ways ... (Naomi exits) it makes the juice ... it extracts the-the pulp and-and-and the vitamins, for-for long life and-and-and vitality. 

JERRY

How could you leave a message like that on my machine.? 

GEORGE

Well how could you just play your message in front of anybody? 

JERRY

Because I didn't think anyone would leave it! 

GEORGE

Well, I didn't think anyone would play it. 

JERRY

Well, now she's not going away for this weekend. 

GEORGE

What do you mean not goin'? Come on, we got plans here. Call her up. 

JERRY

Nah, it's better anyway. I mean really. What was going to happen? I'm a comedian. How can I go out with a girl with a laugh like that? I mean izz-it's like ah, it's like Coco Chanel goin' out with a fish monger. You know, cause she's with all the perfumes and a fish monger's pretty bad smell. 

GEORGE

Wh-Well maybe you should ask Elaine. 

JERRY

Yeah but if I ask Elaine, then Kramer will feel slighted. 

GEORGE

Oh no no no no, don't say anything to Kramer. Susan can't stand him. He vomited all over her. 

JERRY

Yeah, .. wait a minute do you smell smoke? 

KRAMER

Hmm. 

JERRY

Ah, Kramer. 

KRAMER

Hello boys, (in an Irish accent) top of the morning to ya. What do you say? 

JERRY

Will you put that thing out before you start another fire. You had to give him a box of cigars. 

KRAMER

So, what are you guys doin' this weekend? 

GEORGE

uh uh, we're uh .. 

KRAMER

Because I'm going to be playing golf at the Westchester country club. Mmh. 

JERRY

Westchester? Isn't that a private club? 

KRAMER

Oh, that's right buddy. It's private. It's very private. But I met the pro at the golf shop up on 49th St. -- I gave him one of these Cubans and he invites me up to play a free round ... then he says anytime I lay one of these babies on him it's going to be the same deal. Ha ha. Idn't that beautiful. 

JERRY

and GEORGE: Ye, hu, um Ye, 

KRAMER

Man, I'm going to be hitting the links all weekend.&nbsp; Ffoooo (Taking an imaginary swing, he makes the sound of a golf ball being hit) 

GEORGE

Gee, that's-that's too bad. 

JERRY

Yeah, too bad. 

KRAMER

Why? What wa? 

GEORGE

Well, cause we were just saying we were going to ask you to come up to the country with us this weekend.&nbsp; Susan's father has a cabin up there.&nbsp; But, eh, all right, well. 

KRAMER

Well, what, they got any golf courses up there? 

GEORGE

No, no, no, no, no, no, no. 

GEORGE

No, no that's ah, that's pie country. 

JERRY

Yeah 

GEORGE

Yeah, they eh, they do a lot of baking up there. 

KRAMER

Uh huh. 

JERRY

They sell them by the side of the road.&nbsp; Blueberry, Blackberry .... 

GEORGE

Blackberry, Boysenberry ... 

JERRY

Boysenberry, Huckleberry ... 

GEORGE

Huckleberry, Raspberry... 

JERRY

Raspberry, Strawberry ... 

GEORGE

Strawberry, Cranberry ... 

JERRY

Peach. 

ELAINE

I don't know. 

JERRY

Come on. I don't want to tag along with George and Susan. If you're there it'll be a better group. 

ELAINE

What's that? 

JERRY

Ah, it's an autographed picture for my dry cleaner. I never know what to write on these things. I hate doin' this. 

ELAINE

'I'm very imPRESSED'? ... Ah you mean pressed caus' its like a dry cleaner? 

JERRY

Yeah, see that's why I hate it. So, come on, you going to go? 

ELAINE

Well what about the sleeping arrangements? In the Cabin! 

JERRY

Well, um same bed ... 

ELAINE

uh huh (very quietly) 

JERRY

.. and uh, underwear and a tee shirt. 

ELAINE

What about me? 

JERRY

Well you'd be naked of course. 

ELAINE

Uh, that's, ... 

MEL

Excuse me, Jerry Seinfeld? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

MEL

My name's Sanger, Mel Sanger. 

JERRY

Hi. 

MEL

I drive that truck out there. 

JERRY

Oh, the Yoo Hoo? 

MEL

Yeah. 

JERRY

I love Yoo Hoo. 

MEL

Yes, it's a fine product. Anyway I saw you on the Tonight Show a couple weeks ago. I was watching the show with my son Donald. He's got this rare immune deficiency in his blood ... the damnedest thing. Doctors say he has to live in a plastic bubble. Can you imagine that? A bubble. 

JERRY

A bubble? 

ELAINE

A bubble? 

MEL

Yes, a bubble! 

MEL

Do you mind? May I? 

ELAINE

Oh, sure. 

MEL

Ah, It'd break your heart seein' him in there. It's like a prisoner. No friends - just his mother and me. And I'm out there six days a week haulin' Yoo Hoo. We have sacrificed everything. All for the sake of our little ... bubble boy. 

MEL

(in tears) Excuse me, I ah ... 

ELAINE

Oh right here (giving out paper napkins to Mel and Jerry and herself) 

MEL

Excuse me, anyway we were watching ya on TV. 

JERRY

You get in the bubble with him? 

MEL

No. He can see through the bubble. It's plastic. 

JERRY

Oh, I thought it was like an igloo. 

MEL

No, it's clear. 

JERRY

Ah ha. 

ELAINE

Who has the remote?&nbsp; (wipes a tear from her eye) 

MEL

He does. 

ELAINE

The remote goes through the bubble? 

MEL

Yeah, he's in the bubble with the remote. 

JERRY

So you have no control over the remote? 

MEL

No, it's frustrating. 

JERRY

Mmm 

ELAINE

Yeah, of course, yeah. (blows her nose) 

MEL

So anyway, you're his favorite comedian. He laughed so hard the other night we had to give him an extra shot of hemoglobin. 

JERRY

Awe... That's nice! 

MEL

Tomorrow is his birthday and it would mean so much to him if you could find it in your heart ta' pay him a visit and, just say hello. 

JERRY

Hu, well, tomorrow, I, ... 

ELAINE

Jerry! Of course he'd pay him a visit. You'd be happy to. 

JERRY

Yeah, uh, Ok, uh, tomorrow uh, where da ya - where do you live, uh, up town? Upper west side? 

MEL

No, up state. 

JERRY

Up state! Hummm. 

JERRY

He's a bubble boy. 

GEORGE

A bubble boy? 

JERRY

Yes. A bubble boy. 

SUSAN

What's a bubble boy? 

JERRY

He lives in a bubble. 

GEORGE

Boy! 

SUSAN

Say, so what kind of a bubble? Like an igloo? 

JERRY

No, that's what I thought but apparently it's just a big piece of plastic dividing the room. 

SUSAN

Oh. 

GEORGE

What kind of plastic do you think it is? What do you think like that dry cleaning plastic? 

JERRY

That's no good. He wouldn't last ten minutes in there. Anyway what can I do, I promised I'd go visit him tomorrow.&nbsp; It's his birthday. I can't go to the cabin. 

SUSAN

Well, where does he live? 

JERRY

I don't know, up state, Falls, somethin' 

SUSAN

Wait a minute, This is right on the way to the cabin. 

GEORGE

Well all right, beautiful, so you stop in. Ya, ya visit the bubble boy for twenty minutes and then we can go. 

JERRY

You think we can do it? 

SUSAN

Oh I know exactly where this is. You can just follow us. 

JERRY

Oh, great. Ok we'll goin' away. I think I'm excited. 

GEORGE

(laughs) hu hu. 

SUSAN

I'm excited. Oh, you're going to love this cabin. My grandfather built it in 1947. It's it's incredible. 

JERRY

Ohh. 

GEORGE

All right there you go. It's a '47 cabin all right. So, we'll see you tomorrow. 

JERRY

OK. 

KRAMER

Well, 

GEORGE

and JERRY: Very nice, very nice, nice. 

KRAMER

Well, I'm off to the links. 

GEORGE

and JERRY: Yeah. 

KRAMER

Listen, I want to thank you for the invite up state. I'm sorry I can't make it. 

GEORGE

(clears his throat) 

SUSAN

The what? 

GEORGE

Uh, nothing, lets get going. Come on. (laughs) hu hu. 

SUSAN

Did you ...&nbsp; (George grabs her hand) 

GEORGE

No, no, no we'll talk about it later. 

SUSAN

Is that one of the cigars my father gave you?&nbsp; (Susan is pulled from the apt. and Kramer looks out the door to watch them leave) 

ELAINE

Hey, what's with George and Susan? Does he actually like her? 

JERRY

Ah, I don't know if he likes her as much as he likes it.? 

ELAINE

Oh, that's nice! 

JERRY

What's he doing? What is his hurry? 

ELAINE

Well you know George. It's not good enough to get there. You gotta make good time. 

JERRY

I know he once went from West 81st Street to Kennedy Airport in 25 minutes. 

ELAINE

Hmhmhm (laughing quietly) 

JERRY

Look at him. 

ELAINE

Hmhmhm (laughing quietly) 

GEORGE

Would you stop that please. Would you just stop that? 

SUSAN

Why? 

JERRY

What's he doing? Is he out of his mind? Do you see him? I don't even think I see him anymore. Where is he? 

ELAINE

Isn't that blue car him? 

JERRY

No, no that's not him. What happened to him? I can't believe it. I lost him. That stupid idiot. Now what are we going to do? 

ELAINE

It's no big deal Jerry. We'll just meet him at the bubble boy's house. 

JERRY

I don't even know where the bubble boy lives. I - I don't even remember the name of the town. 

ELAINE

Wa',you don't have the directions? 

JERRY

No, I was following him. 

ELAINE

How could you not take the directions? 

JERRY

Because, HE'S my directions. 

SUSAN

I didn't see them George. 

JERRY

We make all these plans - this idiot goes a hundred miles an hour - the whole weekend's over - incredible - just like that - 

ELAINE

Poor little bubble boy. He's sitting there waiting for you in his bubble, or igloo thing, whatever. 

JERRY

I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. I DON'T KNOW WHERE I AM. 

ELAINE

Here just get off at this exit. We'll figure somethin' out. 

SUSAN

We lost them. Do you KNOW THAT. WE LOST THEM! 

GEORGE

Well it's not my fault. Seinfeld can't drive. How hard is it to follow somebody? 

SUSAN

Well now what are you gonna do? 

GEORGE

It's fine, we'll just meet him at the bubble boy's house. 

SUSAN

Does he have the address? 

JERRY

(answering machine) Leave a message. I'll call you back. Thanks. 

NAOMI

(on phone speaker) Hi, Jerry it's Naomi.&nbsp; Ah, listen, if its not too late I, changed my mind, I'd like to go to the cabin. 

KRAMER

Wait, wai, ... ... Yeah. Hello!, Hi, Aw, this is Kramer. Yeah, I'm the next door neighbor. Aw, well you know, ah Jerry's left, uh, uh, But listen, ah, see ah, my golf game got canceled. Uh, I'm thinkin' of going up myself... They got pies and ah, I got the directions right here. 

KRAMER

So then I drive all the way up to the country club and then I find out they got a tournament goin' on. Do you mind if I smoke? 

NAOMI

No. 

KRAMER

These are Cubans. (IN FAKE SPANISH) Maria, poquendo los scientos de estes con gleam. 

NAOMI

Ha ha ha ha ha ha ... Ha ha ha ha ha ha ... Ha haaaa 

GEORGE

I don't know of this is the house. I don't see Jerry's car anywhere. 

GEORGE

Would you stop it. (Susan playfully bites his ear lobe again)&nbsp; Would you quit it please.&nbsp; Someone is going to see us here. 

SUSAN

So what? You are SUCH a prude. 

GEORGE

Hey, I am not a prude sweetheart. I swing with the best of them. (snapping his fingers 5 times) 

SUSAN

Okay, Come on lets go in. 

GEORGE

What? 

SUSAN

Well we should at least tell them what happened. They might be very late if they make it at all. 

GEORGE

I can't go in there. I can't face the bubble boy. 

SUSAN

What's the matter? 

GEORGE

I-I just don't react well to these situations. My grandmother died two months early because of the way I reacted in the hospital. She was getting' better. And then I went to pay her a visit. She saw my face. BOOM. That was the end of it. 

SUSAN

Okay, we're goin' in. Come on. 

GEORGE

Susan, wait please... (grabs her)&nbsp; Please ... 

SUSAN

Come on George. George stop. George. 

GEORGE

Susan, Susan would you wai,.... 

JERRY

(ranting)&nbsp; I can't believe how a little thing like George going too fast - and my whole weekend is gone - the plans, the packing, ... everything. 

ELAINE

Your whole weekend? What about the bubble boy? 

JERRY

Why do you keep bringing up the bubble boy. You don't have to mention the bubble boy?&nbsp; I know about the bubble boy. I'm aware of the bubble boy. Why do you keep reminding me about the bubble boy? 

JERRY

I'll have a cup of coffee and a turkey club. 

WAITRESS

How ?bout you? 

ELAINE

Um, I'll just have a glass of water. 

JERRY

(whispers) You can't just have water. 

ELAINE

Why not? That's all I want. 

JERRY

Well this is not like a park bench where you just come in and sit down. It's a business. 

WAITRESS

Hold it a second. Don't ?chu play on TV? 

JERRY

Oh, no. 

ELAINE

YES! yes. You saw him on TV. 

WAITRESS

What's your name? 

ELAINE

ELAINE

WAITRESS

Oh, ha ha 

JERRY

Uh, I don't have anymore pictures Elaine. 

ELAINE

He's lying. They're in the trunk (takes car keys) Now you get to sign another one. 

JERRY

I'm not lying. 

ELAINE

Yeah, yeah he is. (as she leaves) 

JERRY

She'll have a cup of coffee and a broiled chicken. 

SANGER

See it's not really a bubble. A lot of people think it's an igloo. But it's really just a plastic divider. 

GEORGE

Huh (quietly) 

GEORGE

and SUSAN: (nod) 

GEORGE

Can you uh, go in the bubble? 

SANGER

Well, you have to put so many things on because of the germs. 

MEL

The gloves, the mask, it's a whole production. 

GEORGE

So then he makes his own bed? 

SANGER

Well, that's one of the things we fight about. 

MEL

Would you like to meet him? 

GEORGE

Uh, well, you know,... 

SANGER

Oh, he loves games. Maybe you could play Trivial Pursuit with him. 

DONALD

HEY MA WHAT THE HELL DO I GOT TO DO TO GET SOME FOOD AROUND HERE? I'M STARVIN'. AND IF IT'S PEANUT BUTTER, I'M GONNA SHOVE IT IN YOUR FACE. 

SANGER

(embarrassed) Ha...ha ha ha ha, ha. 

ELAINE

(laughing) hehehe -- One picture left in the trunk. 

JERRY

Uh, THANKS! This is FUN! Yeah, this turned out to be a GREAT weekend. 

ELAINE

Where's my water? 

JERRY

Oh, it's comin'. - Here ya' go. 

WAITRESS

WAITRESS

'Nothing's finer than being in your diner.' 

ELAINE

JERRY

No good? 

ELAINE

THIS is what you came up with? 

JERRY

Well. 

ELAINE

That is so lame. Jerry, people are going to be reading that for the next twenty years and laughing at you. 

JERRY

Yeah, yeah, you're right. Excuse me, excuse me. Would you mind. I'd like to take the picture back. 

WAITRESS

Why 

JERRY

I, I'm not happy with what I wrote. 

WAITRESS

It's good. I like it. 

JERRY

No, believe me it's not good. I'll mail you a new one with something really funny written on it. 

WAITRESS

Well, when you mail me a new one I'll send you back this one. 

JERRY

No, look, you don't understand. I, I want the picture. 

WAITRESS

SANGER

GEORGE

She works for NBC. 

DONALD

HOW 'BOUT TAKING YOUR TOP OFF? 

SANGER

Donald, behave yourself. 

DONALD

COME ON. 

SANGER

GEORGE

Ah, well, you know we gotta been running because of the ... 

DONALD

Ooo. WHAT? ARE YOU AFRAID? 

GEORGE

DONALD

WELL I'M GOING TO KICK YOUR ASS. 

JERRY

Look, I was nice enough to give you the picture. I don't like what I wrote. I don't want it up there. Now please just give it back to me. 

WAITRESS

You are really startin' to get under my skin. 

JERRY

I want that picture. 

WAITRESS

Well, you can't have it! In fact maybe you better just pay your check and get out. 

JERRY

I'm not paying for anything until I get that back. 

WAITRESS

Well, you ain't getting' it back. 

JERRY

Well, maybe I'll just take it back. 

ELAINE

This chicken is really good. 

DONALD

OK, HISTORY ... THIS IS FOR THE GAME. ... HOW YA DOIN' OVER THERE? ... NOT TOO GOOD! 

GEORGE

All right Bubble Boy. Let's just play... Who invaded Spain in the 8th century? 

DONALD

THAT'S A JOKE. THE MOORS. 

GEORGE

Oh, Noooo, I'm so sorry. It's the MOOPS. The correct answer is, The MOOPS. 

DONALD

MOOPS? LET ME SEE THAT. THAT'S NOT MOOPS YOU JERK, IT'S MOORS. IT'S A MISPRINT. 

GEORGE

I'm sorry the card says MOOPS. 

DONALD

IT DOESN'T MATTER. IT'S MOORS. THERE'S NO, MOOPS. 

GEORGE

It's MOOPS. 

DONALD

MOORS. 

GEORGE

MOOPS, 

DONALD

KRAMER

Hey!&nbsp; Anybody home?&nbsp; Oh boy. 

NAOMI

KRAMER

Ah, hold these (boxes of) pies. 

KRAMER

Okay. 

GEORGE

Help, someone. (BUBBLE BOY is strangling George) 

DONALD

THERE'S NO MOOPS. YOU IDIOT. 

SUSAN

Stop it. Let go of him! 

SANGER

Donald, stop it! Now, let go of him Donald. Donald! 

DONALD

KRAMER

KRAMER

Nah, it's good for ya'. Retards the aging process. 

NAOMI

Ready to go swimming?

NAOMI

AHAaaaaaha 

KRAMER

HeYAWaaa 

GEORGE

JERRY! What happened to you? 

JERRY

What happened to you? You were going like a hundred miles an hour. 

GEORGE

Oh I was not. The BUBBLE BOY was tried to kill me. 

ELAINE

What? 

GEORGE

Yeah, Susan tell him. 

SUSAN

It's a long story. 

GEORGE

Yeah. 

DONALD

HEY SEINFELD! 

JERRY

Hey, Happy Birthday. 

ELAINE

Hi. 

DONALD

THANKS FOR SHOWING UP. YOU KNOW YOUR FRIEND HERE TRIED TO KILL ME. 

GEORGE

Oh, you lying little snot. And he's a cheater. Aren't ya' you little twerp? 

DONALD

MOORS 

GEORGE

MOOPS 

DONALD

GEORGE

MOOPS 

DONALD

MOORS 

GEORGE

MOOPS 

GEORGE

Go, go, get out, ... 

JERRY

Fire engines? 

GEORGE

What? Must be a big one. 

ELAINE

Do you smell something? 

JERRY

Yeah, 

SUSAN

Smoke. 

GEORGE

Yeah, (cough) Definite smoke. 

ELAINE

Arghhh, look it's a fire! (cough) 

JERRY

Holy cow! look at that! 

SUSAN

IT'S MY FATHER'S CABIN! 

ELAINE

The CABIN is on fire! 

GEORGE

(Apprehensively) Um. I just realized. Ya' never gave me back the change from the tolls. 

ELAINE

How could this have happened? 

KRAMER

(singing) ... It's a big, wild, funky mountain man ... 

NAOMI

Oh, my god, the cabin? 

JERRY

What are you two doin' here? 

NAOMI

Look at that. 

JERRY

You didn't ... (makes motion like he's lighting a cigar) 

KRAMER

My Cubans!&nbsp; (runs off to the burning cabin) 

JERRY

She hasn't told her father yet? 

GEORGE

No. We're supposed to tell him tonight. 

JERRY

'We're'? What do you mean, 'We're'? 

GEORGE

Susan wants me to be there. 

JERRY

You're meetin' the father for the first time? 

GEORGE

(Reluctantly) Yeah. 

JERRY

(Chuckles slightly) Well, you'll make quite an impression on him when you tell him how you burned his cabin down. 

GEORGE

I didn't burn it down - Kramer did! 

JERRY

(Laughs) I mean, the whole thing is ironic. Think of it: Here the guy is nice enough to give you a box of very fine Cuban cigars.. 

GEORGE

Yeah, I know what happened. 

JERRY

No, but wait, wait: And then you dump them off onto Kramer.. 

GEORGE

(Getting frustrated) I know. 

JERRY

(Continuing) ..Who, who proceeds to burn the man's cabin down with one of those very same cigars! (Topping off his observation) It's very comical.. 

GEORGE

Listen, maybe we shouldn't start writing today. I got a lot on my mind. 

JERRY

(Persisting) No, no, we put this off long enough. Today's the day. 

GEORGE

(Letting his conscious get the best of him) I wonder how Susan's father's going to react to this. Alright, what- what's the worst he could do? So you burn a cabin down.. 

JERRY

(Agreeing) C'mon. It's not even a house - it's, like, a cabin. 

GEORGE

We could build a cabin like (Snaps) that. 

JERRY

(Blunt) Well, maybe not us, but two men could. 

GEORGE

(Looking over the writing materials they just bought) Bics? What, d'ja get, bics? 

JERRY

What, you got a problem with the pen now? 

GEORGE

Well, I like a rolling writer. They're very smooth. 

JERRY

Alright, let's just get to work. (They both move into the living room - ready to start writing their script. Jerry sits down) NBC Pilot, Seinfeld project. Act I, Scene A. 

GEORGE

(Still standing) So, you're gonna sit there? 

JERRY

(Wanting to get started) Just - just park yourself. (George reluctantly sits on the sofa) Alright. Act I, Scene A. 

GEORGE

(Offering) Drink? 

JERRY

No, no thank you. 

GEORGE

(Uncapping his pen) Alright, here we go. 

JERRY

Act I, Scene A.. 

GEORGE

Weren't you supposed to call Elaine? 

JERRY

(Eagerly reaching for the phone) Yes. (George turns the TV on, and begins watching as Jerry dials the number) Hi, is Elaine there? Oh, uh, Hi, Sandra. Uh, yeah. I can hold. (To George) Every time I call I gotta chit-chat with her assistant for, like, twenty minutes. (Back into the phone) Oh, hi, Sandra. Listen, I'm at a pay phone, and there's lots of people here waiting to use it. (Yelling out for believability) I'll be off in a minute! (To Sandra) Yeah, could you just put me through to Elaine? Okay, thanks! (He turns to George) Are you thinking of ideas? (George, picking his teeth with his finger, is absorbed into the television. He seems to not even notice Jerry) Listen, Elaine, is there any way I could get through to you directly? Every time I call Sandra bends my ear for, like, twenty minutes. (Pause) So we're on for later? 

ELAINE

Yeah, I'll come by after work. Hey, I got a rubber pencil thing happenin' here.. (Sandra passes her doorway) Uh, I gotta go. I gotta go. (Hangs up) Sandra! Sandra? Hi, can you come here for a second? 

JERRY

Okay, let's go. (George shuts the television off, ready to work) 

GEORGE

Alright, here we go. You got it? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

GEORGE

Here we go. 

JERRY

Okay, how about this: I'm in my apartment, you come in. 

GEORGE

(Holding out his arms - giving praise) It's beautiful. Now, what do I say? 

ELAINE

Could you do me a favor? Um, when my friends call, could you not talk to them for too long? 

SANDRA

Why? Did Jerry say something? 

ELAINE

No, no. 

SANDRA

He must have said something. 

ELAINE

Oh, no, he didn't say anything. 

SANDRA

(Near tears) I can't work for you! I can't. I'm leaving. (Exits quickly) 

ELAINE

(Calling out to Sandra) No, Sandra. I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I really am! Listen, listen, Jerry's under a lot of pressure right now. It's very hard being a stand-up comedian! Sometimes they don't laugh! 

GEORGE

Alright, let's go. 

JERRY

Here we go. 

KRAMER

Hey. 

GEORGE

yeah, Kramer, we're, uh, kind of in the middle of something here. We're trying to do a little work.. 

JERRY

Yeah, come on. (Kramer gives out a frustrated sigh) What's with you? 

KRAMER

(Complaining) No more golf. 

JERRY

Why? 

KRAMER

Well, you remember I told you about the pro, you know, at the Westchester Country Club, who's letting me play a round every time I give him a couple of those Cuban cigars? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

KRAMER

(Angered) Yeah, well, I lost them all in the fire! (Leaning over the couch, he addresses George) Hey, George, maybe you can ask Susan's father for more, huh? 

GEORGE

What are you, Crazy? I can't ask the guy for more cigars after you burned down his cabin! 

KRAMER

Why? What's one thing got to do with another? 

GEORGE

Kramer, please. 

KRAMER

Well, I can't go back to the public courses, now. I can't! I won't. I mean, you know what that's like? It's crowded, the grass has big brown patches in it, they don't rake the sand traps! Not to mention the caliber of people you have to play with! 

GEORGE

Kramer, I can't help you. You're gonna have to get them some place else. 

KRAMER

(Opening the door) Where? They're Cubans. (Leaves) 

GEORGE

(Getting up) You know what? Maybe I should take off. 

JERRY

What?! 

GEORGE

Well, you know, I gotta go to, uh, Susan's parent's house for dinner.. and, you know, I want to shower first.. and I want to leave myself plenty of time. 

JERRY

(Looking at his watch) You got four hours! What about the script? 

GEORGE

I think we got a bite on it. (Exits) 

ROSS

(To Mr. Ross) Doesn't George look like your sister, Sarah? 

ROSS

(Gruff) A slight resemblance. 

ROSS

(To George) Her son's a podiatrist, you know. 

GEORGE

Ohh, I have tremendous respect for people who work with feet. I mean, to dedicate yourself to the foot - you're toiling in virtual anonymity. I mean.. 

ROSS

How are you enjoying those cigars I gave you? 

GEORGE

Oh, uh, the cigars.. (Chuckles nervously) I'm, uh, suckin' 'em down. I'm puffing my brains out, yeah. 

ROSS

You know those cigars are made special for Castro? 

GEORGE

(Impersonating Carson) I didn't not know that. Weird. Wild. (Susan and George both laugh) 

ROSS

What? 

SUSAN

(Explaining) He's doing Johnny Carson, daddy. 

ROSS

I didn't care much for his jokes. 

SUSAN

(To George) Daddy never laughs. 

GEORGE

Oh, well, so what? Laughter - what is that? I mean, what is the point of opening your mouth and going 'Ha, ha!'? What is that? 'Ha, ha!'? 

ROSS

You know, you can't get those cigars anywhere. 

ROSS

You and your cigars.. 

ROSS

(Shooting back at his wife) Wear some more lipstick. 

SUSAN

Daddy, there's, um, there's something that we have to talk to you about.. 

ROSS

Oh, I forgot to ask you - how'd you like the cabin? 

GEORGE

(Even more nervous than before) Oh, the, uh, the cabin.. well, (Clears throat) 

JERRY

Right after we get off the phone, then you go and tell her that?! Well, of course she knows it was me who complained! Now I'm responsible for this woman's quitting. Oh, this is unbelievable! 

ELAINE

(Full of guilt) I know! I screwed up. It's all my fault. Would you call her? 

JERRY

(Caving in) Ohh.. dial the number. (Elaine picks up the phone, and starts to dial) How could you do this? 

ELAINE

(Handing the phone over to him) I was just trying to help you. 

JERRY

(Muttering) Oh, just trying to (Rudely grabs the phone from her) help me.. (Into the phone) Hello? Sandra? Hi, uh, this is Jerry Seinfeld. (Elaine now has her hand in a bowl of popcorn - grabbing a fistful) Listen, I - I just want to tell you, (Jerry sternly grabs Elaine's hand - forcing her to drop the popcorn, then shoves her hand away. Elaine sits back like a scolded child) There's been a terrible misunderstanding: See, I told Elaine that, uh, it was a real treat talking to you on the phone, and she thought I was being sarcastic, you know, 'cause I'm a comedian and all. She thought I meant (Deeply sarcastic) 'Yeah, it was a real treat talking to her on the phone.' (Back to normal) You know, but I was really being sincere.. No, of course I like you.. Tonight? ..Um, uh, hold on a second. (To Elaine, whispering) Now she wants to have a drink with me. (Elaine mouths out 'Just go' while making gestures. Jerry, again, gives in. Back on the phone) Yeah, I think I can.. Um.. yeah, I know where that is.. Ok.. uh, I'll see you there. Okay, bye. (Hangs up, peeved) Now I gotta have a drink with her. 

GEORGE

The cabin.. (Laughs nervously) Well.. (Pauses as he thinks of a way to break the news, then decides to pass it off) Susan? 

SUSAN

Uhh.. about the cabin.. 

ROSS

(Cutting her off) I love that place. My father built that cabin in 1947. My mother was recuperating from Impetigo at the time, and dad thought it would be a good idea to get her out into the fresh air. She died there the following winter. And he passed away 10 years later to the day. His last words to me were, (Mrs. Ross, bored out of her mind, has obviously heard this story a million times - she mouths the words as Mr. Ross says them) 'Cherish the cabin.' Not, uh, 'Take care of your sister.' (Adding) She's a paraplegic. But, 'Cherish the cabin.' (Smiling, reflecting) And I have.. for 45 years. It's often been a.. sanctuary for me. 

GEORGE

(Annoyingly butting in) Kinda like Superman's fortress of solitude. 

ROSS

What? 

GEORGE

S, uh, Superman - he, uh, built the fortress of solitude up at the North Pole, to, uh, you know, sort of get away from it all.. 

ROSS

When I go, I'm passing it on to her. (Pointing at Susan) 

ROSS

(Drunk, she laughs out loud) I'll take a hotel any day. 

SUSAN

Daddy.. 

ROSS

Yes? 

SUSAN

Daddy, about the cabin.. 

ROSS

(Laughing, she points to her shirt) Look, Henry, I spilled wine on me! (Laughs again) 

ROSS

(To Susan) What about it? 

SUSAN

Well, the thing is.. 

ROSS

What? What is it? 

SUSAN

Well, the - the cabin, is, kind of, uh.. George? 

GEORGE

(Extremely blunt) Burned. 

ROSS

Burned? 

SUSAN

There was a fire, and it uh.. 

GEORGE

Burned. 

ROSS

(Still trying to comprehend what has happened) The cabin burned? 

GEORGE

(Laughs) yeah, burned. Whoo.. 

ROSS

(Laughing out loud) Burned! (George laughs with her) 

ROSS

Was anything found? Was it all burned to the ground?! Did they find anything? 

SUSAN

(Solemn) No. Nothing. 

ROSS

(Laughing, she's obviously getting a kick out of her husband's misfortune) Nothing! Ha, ha, ha. 

GEORGE

Eh, but, you know, Mr. Ross, if - if you look at the whole situating, what with it being your cigars, and everything, it's really rather ironic - one might even say, in a sense, comical.. (Mr. Ross has, by now, left the room. Mrs. Ross is pointing at George, nodding, laughing. As if to say he hit the bullseye. George calls out to Mr. Ross) Really. Think about it. 

SANDRA

(Offended) I can't believe you said that! 

JERRY

What?! 

SANDRA

(Buttoning her jacket) How could you say something like that to me?! 

JERRY

What? What?! You were the one who was talking dirty. I was just trying to keep up! 

SANDRA

That was a weird thing to say. 

JERRY

Why? It didn't mean anything. I was just trying to join in so you wouldn't feel embarrassed. 

SANDRA

Ohh, I think you're really sick. 

JERRY

(Getting slightly offended) I'm not sick. (Pointing at her) You - you said much sicker things than me. 

SANDRA

I'm leaving. (Moves toward the door. Jerry blocks her path) 

JERRY

I really think you're making too much of this. 

SANDRA

(Attempting to get past him) Excuse me. (They both move to the door) 

JERRY

Let me walk you to a cab. 

SANDRA

(Opens the door) That's ok. 

JERRY

I mean, the main thing is that this is just between us, and that'll be the end of it. 

SANDRA

Oh, really? (Quickly walks out) 

JERRY

(Calling after her) I mean, people - they're not interested in things like this. They don't want to hear about it. They really don't. 

JERRY

So, we're.. uhh, drinkin' and talkin', and uhh, so, she starts rubbing my leg. 

GEORGE

Wo-hoah! What did you do? 

JERRY

(Sarcastic) Have you ever told a woman to stop touching your leg? 

GEORGE

Yeah, right. 

JERRY

I mean, I know it's the wrong thing to do. She works in Elaine's office. I know it's wrong - but I can't get that hand off my leg. I mean, I'm looking at the hand, and I'm thinking, 'That hand should not be on my leg.' But I can't make my brain to get my mouth to say the words, 'Would you mind?!' 

GEORGE

Yeah, woman have no problem getting the hand off. How do they do that? 

JERRY

I don't know, they're working on a whole other level.. 

GEORGE

Alright, so, go ahead. 

JERRY

So we go back to my apartment.. 

GEORGE

(Expressing shock) Woah. Whoa! Woah! 

JERRY

So, we're, uh, foolin' around there.. you know, it's getting a little passionate.. (Scoots closer to George, to prevent others from hearing) and, uh, she starts with the dirty talking. 

GEORGE

(Putting his hands up) Alright, alright, hold on! (Jerry has George's full attention) Time out! Woah, woah! (Scooting in, giddy) What did she say? 

JERRY

(Modest) Oh, you know, the usual.. 

GEORGE

No, I don't know. How do I know the usual? 

JERRY

Typical things. 

GEORGE

(Picking up the ketchup) What typical? Gimme typical. Gimme some typical. 

JERRY

She says, uh.. (Mumbles something inaudible. George, so shocked by what he's just heard, accidentally squeezes the ketchup bottle - ketchup squirts out and files off-screen. George reacts deeply) 

GEORGE

(Breathing deeply) That's very dirty. (Jerry nods) That's absolutely filthy. 

JERRY

..And then she starts talking about her panties. 

GEORGE

(Yelling out to a waitress) Gonna need some water here! 

JERRY

So I said something. 

GEORGE

Ok, what did you say? 

JERRY

(Defensively) Now, bear in mind, I am just trying to keep up. 

GEORGE

Of course. 

JERRY

Okay? So, she's taking about her panties, so, uh.. So, I said, 'You mean the panties your mother laid out for you?' 

GEORGE

(Takes a few seconds to mull this one over. Shooting Jerry a confused look, he repeats it) 'The panties your mother laid out for you'? (Jerry nods) What does that mean? 

JERRY

(Throwing up his hands) I don't know! It just popped out. 

GEORGE

Well, how did she react? 

JERRY

She flipped out! Just left. 

GEORGE

Well, that's not offensive. (Reflects) It's abnormal, but it's not offensive. 

JERRY

Look, the main thing is I don't want Elaine to know about any of this. I mean, especially the panty remark. I mean, it's embarrassing. And she's never let me hear the end of it. 

JERRY

She will tell her. She's going back to work. I talked her into it - how stupid was that? (Changing subject as they both collect money to pay for the check) Hey, so, Susan's father took that news pretty hard, huh? 

GEORGE

Yeah, yeah. He went into the bedroom and started sobbing. 

JERRY

I guess he failed to see the humor in it. 

GEORGE

Huh. (Makes a 'over his head' gesture with his arm) C'mon, let's go, go. We got a lot of work to do today. 

JERRY

(Getting up) Alright, big work day. 

GEORGE

That's right. 

GEORGE

Okay. 

JERRY

Let's go. 

GEORGE

Here we are. 

JERRY

Right now. 

GEORGE

Let's do it. 

JERRY

You and me. 

GEORGE

Okay. 

JERRY

Alright. 

GEORGE

What'dya got? 

JERRY

(Reading from his notebook) I got: You enter, you go 'Hi', and I go, 'Hello.' Now.. we need something here.. 

KRAMER

Oh, hey. 

GEORGE

Don't be silly. 

JERRY

Come in, we're taking a break. 

KRAMER

(Moving back into the room) Oh, yeah? 

JERRY

Yeah! 

KRAMER

Uh, George, did you talk to that guy about getting me some more cigars? 

GEORGE

(Scoffs) No, I told you, I'm not gonna do that. 

KRAMER

(Concluding) Okay.. well, I guess I'm just going to have to take matters into my own hands, huh? (Pause) Alright, I'll see you guys. (Leaves, despite 'No, don't go!' and other various comments by Jerry and George) 

KRAMER

Buenos dias. 

SECRETARY

Buenos dias. 

KRAMER

Uh, habla ingles? 

SECRETARY

Si. 

KRAMER

Giddy-up. Ok, uh, (Looks at a woman wearing dark sunglasses and sitting on a sofa behind him. He reacts oddly) Um. I need to talk to someone. 

SECRETARY

What is this about? 

KRAMER

Uh, well, It's a very private matter, but it's extremely urgent. 

SECRETARY

Are you an American? 

KRAMER

Oh, yeah. 

SECRETARY

I see.. excuse me. (Picks up the phone) 

KRAMER

Okay. 

JERRY

(Stirring, he gets up to answer the buzzer) Alright, let's get going. C'mon, c'mon now. (Approaches the intercom) C'mon, let's get it together.. (Through intercom) Yeah? 

ELAINE

It's Elaine. 

JERRY

C'mon up. (Slightly opens the door for Elaine) 

GEORGE

(Standing up, still waking up) Alright, you know what we should do? We should go to the movies. Get away from this script for a while.. 

JERRY

(Agreeing) Yeah, we should. 

GEORGE

Alright, I just have to go over to the Ross' apartment and drop off Susan's sunglasses. You'll come with me? 

JERRY

Yeah. Wha - what, does she live with them? 

GEORGE

No, no, no, no. 

JERRY

Oh. 

ELAINE

Hey, nice going, Jerome Seinfeld! 

JERRY

What? 

ELAINE

I just got a message from Sandra, she's coming back to work. 

JERRY

Well, then, you've just got to fire her! Don't even think about it - there's no two ways about it. 

ELAINE

Why? What happened? Did you talk? 

JERRY

Talk? Did I talk? It - you're darn right I talk to her! We talked up a storm - and I concluded from the basis of these talks that this isn't anybody you should be talking to. 

ELAINE

Really? 

JERRY

Yes. 

ELAINE

Really? You really think I should fire her? 

JERRY

Oh yeah. Yeah, in fact, if George and I weren't so busy here working on the script, I'd do it myself. 

MAN

(To secretary) Expira te afuera. 

KRAMER

(Standing up, greeting the men) Buenos dias. 

MAN

What is your name, Senor? 

KRAMER

Uh, Kramer. 

MAN

So, Senor Kramer, what is this about? 

KRAMER

(Leaning in, confidentially) Cigars. 

MAN

(Confused) Cigars? 

KRAMER

(Definite) Cigars. 

MAN

What about cigars? 

KRAMER

Uh, see here, I.. (Pulls out a paper ring from his pocket) I saved one of the cigar rings.. 

MAN

Ohh.. (Laughs, pulling a cigar from his inner coat pocket) You mean - one of these.. 

KRAMER

(Pointing at the cigar, incredibly nervous) Yeah, yeah. That- that's, uh, okay, So, uh, I'd like to buy a couple of boxes of those from you, yeah? 

MAN

(Deeply sniffs the cigar's aroma) You do realize, of course, these are illegal in your country. 

KRAMER

Um, wha - oh, illegal, huh? 

MAN

I like that jacket.. 

SUSAN

Hi! 

GEORGE

Hi, how are ya? (They kiss) 

SUSAN

Hey, Jerry. 

JERRY

Hi. 

SUSAN

I thought you two guys were working today. 

JERRY

Ah, just - takin' a little break. 

GEORGE

(Chuckling) yeah. Uh, oh, here's your sunglasses. (Hands them to her) 

SUSAN

Ok, thanks. Come on in for a second. (They move into the living room. Susan gestures to a man sitting on the couch reading the paper) This is my brother, Ricky. He's home from college for the weekend. 

GEORGE

Ohh, hey there, young fella. (They shake hands) What's your major? 

RICKY

(Blunt) I don't have one. 

GEORGE

Well, you should always consider podiatry. (Patting Ricky on the shoulder) There's nothing wrong with the feet. (Ricky looks critically back at George) 

SUSAN

(Now gestures to an old woman in a wheelchair) And this is my Aunt, Sara. 

SARA

(Staring at George) He doesn't look like me. 

ROSS

Sara, what do you have on your wheels? 

SARA

Nothing, they're clean. 

ROSS

Ricky, did you wipe her wheels off? 

RICKY

(Annoyed) Yes. 

ROSS

(Concluding) Well, they're filthy. It's just a matter of common courtesy.. (Wheels Sara over to a spot off the rug) When you come in the house you wipe your wheels. 

SUSAN

Excuse me. (Answer the door. It's her doorman, Raymond, carrying a burnt box) Hello, Raymond. 

RAYMOND

Ah, yes, the man from the insurance company dropped this off this morning. He said it was the only thing left from the remains of the fire. 

SUSAN

(Accepts the box) Oh, thank you. (As the doorman leaves, she turns to Jerry and George) Wow, I've never seen this before.. (Opens the charred box) Oh, they're letters. (Hands the box to George) Here. 

GEORGE

Oh, sure. (Holds the box out as Susan takes out a few letters) 

SUSAN

From.. (Trying to read one) from John Cheever. 

GEORGE

Oh, wow. 

SUSAN

(Chuckles as she opens up one of the letters. She reads it) 'Dear Henry, last night with you was bliss. I fear my.. orgasm (She now has everyone's attention) has left me a cripple. I don't how how I shall ever get back to work.. (Jerry and George make odd faces as Susan is still concentrating on the notes) I love you madly, John. (Pause) P.S. Loved the cabin.' (George nods, and Jerry gives a 'Oh, of course' reaction) 

GEORGE

Well, we.. we, we, ah.. 

JERRY

(Looking at his watch ) Yeah.. 

GEORGE

We really should be, uh, heading out.. 

JERRY

Yeah. (Tapping his watch) Look at the time. 

GEORGE

You know, the time.. 

ROSS

The box! (Rushes toward George, grabbing the box away from him, then the letters from Susan's hands) My letters! Gimme that! (Now holding them against his chest, defensively) Who told you to open this?! 

ROSS

(Hysterical) Who's John?! Who's John?! 

SARA

(Yelling out) I knew it! 

ROSS

I want to know who John is! 

RICKEY

John Cheever?! Dad, you and John Cheever?! 

ROSS

(Proclaiming) Yes! Yes, he was the most wonderful person I've ever known. And I love him deeply! In a way you could never understand.. (Slowly walks back to his room, leaving everyone speechless. Susan seems to be affected the most. A long pause passes. Jerry gives George a signal that they should go) 

GEORGE

Well, we really should be- 

JERRY

Yeah. 

GEORGE

Uh, heading out. Jerry really hates to miss the coming attractions. 

JERRY

Yeah, and, (Pointing to his watch) because of the.. (Slowly exiting) time. 

GEORGE

yeah, time is what he's indicating there.. 

JERRY

(Waving good bye) We'll see ya. 

GEORGE

Uh, anyway, (Waving bye to everyone) onward and upward. 

GEORGE

Alright, here we go. 

JERRY

Alright, let's go. 

GEORGE

Come on now. 

JERRY

Right now. 

GEORGE

Here we go. 

JERRY

You and me. 

GEORGE

You got it. 

JERRY

No foolin' 

GEORGE

Ok, so, what'dya got? 

JERRY

(Looking at his notebook) Alright, I got, uh, you come in, you say 'Hi', and I say 'Hello'. 

GEORGE

Alright, so, we need something.. 

JERRY

Yeah.. how about this: I say 'How's it goin'?' 

GEORGE

'How's it going?' - beautiful. 

JERRY

(Getting up to answer the door) Alright, did you get that line? 

GEORGE

(Nodding, writing) 'How's it going?' 

JERRY

Did you write it down? 

GEORGE

I'm writin' it. 'How's it going?' 

JERRY

Okay.. (Opens the door to a frantic Elaine) 

ELAINE

Real good! 

JERRY

What?! 

ELAINE

Do you know how much money you cost me today?! 429 dollars! 

JERRY

What?! How? 

ELAINE

I got Sandra transferred to another office upstairs, okay?! So, she blabs to Lippman about my long distance calls to Europe! 

JERRY

What calls?! 

ELAINE

Uh! I made a friend when I was in Europe, okay?! And we've been in touch, and Sandra told Lippman! 

JERRY

Oh, did - did she say anything else to you? 

ELAINE

(Confused) 'Anything else'? What do you mean 'anything else'? 

JERRY

So she just left the office - didn't say a word to you about anything? 

ELAINE

Yeah! 

JERRY

(Smiling to himself) Beautiful. 

ELAINE

Why is that beautiful? 

JERRY

Oh, no, not beautiful. 

ELAINE

It's four hundred and twenty nine dollars! 

JERRY

Hey, look, I'm going to pay for that. 

ELAINE

No, no. 

JERRY

(Taking out his checkbook) No, I insist. I was the one who encouraged you to fire her - the whole thing was all my- 

ELAINE

(Giving up too easy) Okay. 

JERRY

(Pauses, noting Elaine's quick accept) fault. (Starts to write a check out, then stops, looking at the door) Do you smell smoke? 

KRAMER

Oh, hey! Hey, Jer, I want you to meet my new friends, here. (Introducing each one) This is, uh, Louis, Jorge, and Umberto. 

JERRY

Oh, how you doing? Nice to meet you. 

KRAMER

Yeah, we're heading up to Westchester - gonna hit the links. 

JERRY

Oh. (Notices Louis' jacket) Isn't that, uh, your.. 

KRAMER

(Trying to avoid the issue) Oh, yeah, yeah, Okay, we're going. (To his three friends) Vamanos, muchachos! 

ELAINE

(Turns to George, he is now reading a book) Hey, what are you reading? 

GEORGE

Oh, uh, 'The Falconer' by John Cheever. It's really excellent. 

ELAINE

(To Jerry) John Cheever, you ever read any of his stuff? 

JERRY

Uh, yeah, I'm familiar with some of his writing. (George shoots Jerry a smirk, then returns to his book) Alright, (Hand the check to Elaine) look, we gotta get back to work. We just had a big breakthrough here. 

ELAINE

(Folding up the check) Ok, I'll leave you two alone. 

JERRY

(Moving back into the living room) Okay. 

ELAINE

(In the door way) Maybe I'll go visit my mother. She just bought me some new panties (Jerry pauses right before sitting in his chair) and they're - all laid out for me. (Leaves, smiling to herself. Jerry and George both look at each other, frozen in their places) 

JERRY

(answering machine) leave a message and I?ll call you back, thanks. JOE DIVOLA: Jerry, Joe Divola. *Pbt* *Pbt* *Pbt* I have a hair on my tongue, I can't get it off, you know how much I hate that? Course you do, you put it there. I know what you said about me Seinfeld. I know you badmouthed me to the execs at NBC, put the kibosh on my deal. Now I?m gonna put the kibosh on you. You know I?ve kiboshed before, and I will kibosh again. 

KRAMER

So, what do you think? 

JERRY

About what? 

KRAMER

About the opera. 

JERRY

Nah, I don't wanna go. 

KRAMER

You gotta go. 

JERRY

I-I-I don't like the opera. What are they singing for? Who sings? You got something to say, say it! 

KRAMER

Jerry, you don't understand, that?s the way they talk in Italy, they sing to one another. Kramer starts to sing in bad Italian. 

JERRY

All right, all right. 

KRAMER

That?s the way it was, you know. You listen to the language, its got that sing songy quality. It?s the language Jerry, the language 

JERRY

So why don't they talk like that now? 

KRAMER

Well its, uh, well its too hard to keep up, you know, they were tired. 

KRAMER

Better get that 

JERRY

Yeah? 

ELAINE

(intercom) it?s me! 

JERRY

Come on up. 

KRAMER

So, huh? 

JERRY

I don't know 

KRAMER

Oh come on Jerry, its opening night, black tie, Pagliacci! The great clown, the great sad tragic clown, like you. 

JERRY

Well it?s very flattering. How did you get these tickets, I heard they're impossible to get. 

KRAMER

Oh, well I have many associates. 

JERRY

I don't know, opera, it?s not my kind of thing. 

KRAMER

All right, you not gonna go I?m not gonna go, I?m gonna call the whole thing off. 

JERRY

No, wait a minute, wait a minute, that?s not fair, what about George, Susan and Elaine, what do you need me for? 

KRAMER

You're the nucleus, the straw that stirs the drink. You're the Miana! 

JERRY

Well I guess if I?m the Miana I should go. All right, all right. 

ELAINE

Hi! 

JERRY

Hi! 

KRAMER

Hey! Hi Elaine! 

ELAINE

You got the tickets right? 

KRAMER

Well no, I don't have them on me. 

ELAINE

What? That?s why I came all the way over here. 

KRAMER

My friends got 'em, I?m going to pick them up tomorrow. 

ELAINE

Oh, I was gonna surprise Joey with them, you got an extra one right? 

KRAMER

Oh yeah! 

JERRY

So I finally get to meet your pal Joey. 

ELAINE

Its killing you isn?t it? 

JERRY

Yeah, so Joey?s a great lover of the opera 

ELAINE

Listen, I got news for ya, its nice to be involved with somebody who?s interested in something other than nick at night. Now he?s got a grip on reality, he's happy, he's well adjusted. 

JERRY

Well I?m looking forward to meeting him. 

ELAINE

I've got to go 

JERRY

Where are you going, what?s the rush? 

ELAINE

I'm going to surprise Joey, I?ve never been to his apartment so I?m just going to 'pop in' 

JERRY

Oh, good, men love that! 

JERRY

Hey! 

KRAMER

JERRY

KRAMER

Steady, steady, now calm yourself, come on, now get a hold of yourself, 

JERRY

What the hell he's supposed to be on medication I don't understand he told me he's getting medication what happened to his medication!? 

KRAMER

OK Quiet! Quiet! Now let me think! 

JERRY

I'm gonna call the cops. That?s what I?m doing, I?m calling the cops. 

KRAMER

The cops? What are you calling the cops for? They?re not going to do anything! 

JERRY

What do you mean they're not going to do anything, they're the cops, they gotta do something, he just put the kibosh on me, do you know what the kibosh means, its a kibosh! 

KRAMER

Yiddigtkk ka kibosh. 

JERRY

I mean it's a terrible mistake, I mean he thinks I ruined some deal of his at NBC, I don't know anything about any deal at NBC. 

KRAMER

Call him and tell him 

JERRY

That?s what I?ll do, I?ll just call him and tell him, I?ll tell him. That?s all I?ll do. He's a human being, I?ll talk to him. He'll understand. Right? 

KRAMER

Right.... Don't mention my name 

JERRY

Oh, I got the machine. 

KRAMER

What?s his message like? 

JERRY

Nice! 

KRAMER

Eh! 

JERRY

(into phone) Hello Joe, listen this is Jerry Seinfeld, I really think there?s been a huge colossal misunderstanding, 

KRAMER

Big! Big! 

JERRY

and I feel if we can just talk about this we can straighten the whole thing out, so listen, so call me back. Bye. 

ELAINE

Joey? Joey? 

ELAINE

Oh god, oh, its you! You scared me! 

DIVOLA

Good. Fear is our most primal emotion. 

ELAINE

You left your door open. 

DIVOLA

I know, I like to encourage intruders. 

ELAINE

(laughs) What?s all this? 

DIVOLA

Do you like it? My home is a shrine to you. 

ELAINE

Where did you get all these pictures? 

DIVOLA

I took them myself with a telephoto lens. Coming out of your office, your apartment, shopping, showering. 

ELAINE

Showering? 

DIVOLA

I developed them myself in my dark room. Would you like to see? 

ELAINE

In the dark room? Uh no, no thank you. Not right now. I'm a day person!... Are you all right? 

DIVOLA

Why 

ELAINE

Well I don't know, you just don't seem yourself? 

DIVOLA

Who am I? Who am I supposed to be? 

ELAINE

That?s a good question, good question, its very... exerstential! Who are you? Who am I? Yeah, well. 

DIVOLA

What are you doing here? 

ELAINE

Oh, nothing, I just stopped by to chat, you know, shoot the breeze. 

DIVOLA

Were you able to get those opera tickets to Pagliacci from that friend of yours? I'm really looking forward to it. 

ELAINE

Oh, no, he couldn't get them. We're not going. 

DIVOLA

Really? 

ELAINE

Oh, dammit, you know I just remembered I gotta go, I left something on, the gas, the lights, the water in the tub. Something is on somewhere so I?m just gonna get the uh.. 

DIVOLA

You know the story of Pagliacci, Nedda? 

ELAINE

Uh.. I?m Elaine! 

DIVOLA

He's a clown whose wife is unfaithful to him. 

ELAINE

Oh. 

DIVOLA

Do you think I?m a clown, Nedda? 

ELAINE

Do I think you're a clown? No, not if it?s bad to be a clown, if it?s bad to be a clown then you are definitely not a clown. But if its good to be a clown then, you know, I would have to rethink the whole thing. 

DIVOLA

You've betrayed me with another, haven't you, Nedda? Who is he. I want you to tell me who he is. I want his name. Tell me his name. 

ELAINE

Oh, like any man would ever look at me, come on, I?m gonna... get out of here. 

DIVOLA

Pagliacci kills his wife. 

ELAINE

Se, now that?s terrible, that is not a nice thing to do at all, I don?t know how this Paliachi thing turns out but you know I would assume that there is big big trouble for that clown 

DIVOLA

You're not leaving 

JERRY

(on phone) But officer, he threatened me! I don't understand, that?s not right! What if it was the President of the United States I bet you'd investigate. So what?s the difference, I?m a comedian of the United States, and I?ll tell you I?m under just as much pressure. Alright, thanks anyway, ok bye. 

JERRY

(cautiously) Who is it? 

GEORGE

It's George. 

GEORGE

What, are you locking the door now? 

JERRY

Well, well, look at you. It?s a little skimpy there isn't it? 

GEORGE

Do you know the last time I wore this thing? Six years ago, when I made that toast at Bobby Leighton's wedding. 

JERRY

Ooo, that was a bad toast. 

GEORGE

It wasn't that bad. 

JERRY

I never heard anybody curse in a toast. 

GEORGE

I was trying to loosen 'em up a little bit. 

JERRY

There were old people there, all the relatives. You were like a Red Fox record. I mean, at the end of the toast nobody even drank. They were just standing there, they were just frozen! That might have been one of the worst all time toasts. 

GEORGE

Alright, still her father didn't have to throw me out like that, he could have just asked me to leave. The guy had me in a headlock! Susan's not going tonight you know. 

JERRY

What do you mean not going? why not? 

GEORGE

I don't know, she said she had to pick up a friend of hers at the airport. It cost me a hundred dollars this ticket. 

JERRY

Why doesn't she pay for hers? 

GEORGE

That's a very good question. You know she and I go out for dinner, she doesn't even reach for the check. That?s all I?m asking for is a reach. Is that so much to ask for? 

JERRY

It's nice to get a reach. 

JERRY

Who is it? 

KRAMER

It's me! 

KRAMER

What, are you locking the door now? 

JERRY

Because of Divola! Get in here... How come you're not dressed? 

KRAMER

I am dressed. 

JERRY

You're going like this? 

KRAMER

Yeah. Hey I want you to hear something. 

JERRY

I thought you said people dress up when they go to the opera! 

KRAMER

People do, I don't. 

JERRY

Well what about me! If you're going like that, I?m not going like this. 

GEORGE

Wait a minute, wait a minute, do you think I?m comfortable here. I can't change, I?ve got no clothes here! You've got to go like that, I can?t go like this alone! 

JERRY

Why should I be uncomfortable just because my apartment is closer to town hall than yours? 

GEORGE

That?s not the issue, we're friends, if I?ve got to be uncomfortable, you've got to be uncomfortable too! 

JERRY

All right, all right, I?ll wear this. It's bad enough I?ve got to go to the opera I?ve got to sit next to ozzie nelson over here. 

JERRY

Would you turn that down! What is that crap! 

KRAMER

It's Pagliacci! 

JERRY

Oh beautiful. Listen, we've got a little problem here, we've got two extra tickets. 

KRAMER

Why? What happened? 

JERRY

Well Susan isn't going and Elaine just left me a message her friend isn't going either. 

KRAMER

That?s fantastic! We'll scalp the tickets, we'll make maybe five hundred a ticket. 

GEORGE

What? Really? 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

GEORGE

People are looking for tickets here? 

KRAMER

What, are you kidding? Opening night Pavarotti and Pagliacci. Ha, we're gonna clean up! 

GEORGE

Oh man! I knew I was gonna love the opera. 

JERRY

Oh yeah right. 

KRAMER

OK come on, let?s go get the tickets. 

GEORGE

All right, all right. 

JERRY

All right, you guys listen, I've got to wait here for Elaine, I'll meet you in front of the theatre. 

GEORGE

Oh, wait, isn't scalping illegal? 

KRAMER

Oh yeah! 

JERRY

You sprayed him in the eyes with Binaca? 

ELAINE

Cherry Binaca, it?s new. 

JERRY

See, I don't get that. First they come out with the regular, then a year later they come out with the cherry. They know that we like the cherry, start with cherry! Then come out with the regular! 

ELAINE

It's like I didn't even know him. He's like a totally different person. 

JERRY

Well you should hear the message from my nut. Where's George and Kramer, I want to get inside already, I don't like standing out here, I feel very vulnerable. 

JERRY

Hey, hey, what are you doing, that?s my quarter. 

JERRY

I was just flipping it, it's mine. 

JERRY

All right, do you want the quarter, take the quarter, but don't try and tell me it's yours. 

JERRY

What, do you think I care about the money? Is that what you think? You want me to show you what I care about money? Here look, here look at this, here's a dollar here look, there, that?s how much I care about money. 

JERRY

Oh yeah, well why don?t you Just get lost. 

JERRY

Because I was standing here, that?s why. 

JERRY

Yeah! 

JERRY

I kinda like this opera crowd, I feel tough... Anybody else got a problem? 

KRAMER

I got two, I got two huh, Paliachi, who needs two, Pagliacci, come on, the great tragic clown, come on, check it out, he laughs, he cries, he sings, Pagliacci. Hey, I got two beauties right here, check it out all right. 

KRAMER

Oh yeah, I?m selling. 

KRAMER

Orchestra, Row G, dead center, primo! You'll think you died and went to heaven. 

KRAMER

All right, I?ll tell you what I?ll do. Cause you look like a nice guy, a thousand dollars for the duce. 

GEORGE

Ok, it's a deal! 

KRAMER

Pzzzt. No. 

GEORGE

No? Are you crazy? 

KRAMER

Look, let me handle this. 

GEORGE

Five hundred dollars, that?s a great deal! 

KRAMER

You're blowing this, the guys a pigeon. 

GEORGE

Did you see that? The guy's walking away. What is wrong with you? That was a three hundred dollar profit. 

KRAMER

Look, I know what I?m doing here George. 

GEORGE

This is not a Metallica concert, it?s an opera alright, a little dignity, a little class, just give me my ticket, I will stand over here and sell it. 

KRAMER

Oh, yeah. 

GEORGE

Thank you very much. You just stand over there, I?ll stand over here. 

KRAMER

I know where I?m standing. 

GEORGE

Alright. 

KRAMER

Hey! 

GEORGE

(shouting) Get your Paliachi! 

JERRY

Where are they already? 

ELAINE

I guarantee they don't sell either one of those tickets. 

JERRY

Hey, look, there's Bobby Eighteen?s father-in-law, Mr Reichman. George and I were just talking about that today, I can?t believe it! That?s the guy who threw George out of the wedding. 

ELAINE

Oh, yeah, when George made that bad toast! 

JERRY

Do you remember the curse toast? 

ELAINE

Oh yeah, the curse toast. 

JERRY

So, can you believe that message? Now I?ve got to spend the rest of my life looking over my shoulder. 

ELAINE

Me too 

JERRY

Crazy Joe Divola 

ELAINE

How do you know his name? 

JERRY

What do you mean? Why wouldn't I know his name? 

ELAINE

I never told you his name. 

JERRY

I never told you his name. 

ELAINE

Wait a second, who are we talking about here? 

JERRY

Joe Divola. 

ELAINE

Right, Joe Divola 

JERRY

How do you know his name? 

ELAINE

I've been out with him three times, I should know the mans name. 

JERRY

Oh my god, its Joe Divola 

ELAINE

Is he stalking you? are you kidding me? 

JERRY

That madman is trying to kill me. 

ELAINE

Oh, Jerry, why didn't you tell me his name! Oh my god, he accused me of seeing someone else, he said tell me his name, he said tell me his name!! 

JERRY

Oh! He said that! Can you imagine what he'll do if he sees me with you! He'll think I?m the one who ruined his deal at NBC and took away his girl, he'll put a kibosh on me! 

ELAINE

Oooohh, what about me! 

DIVOLA

Excuse me 

JERRY

Aaahhhhh!! 

GEORGE

But this is Pavarotti! 

REICHMAN

You know Steven Holstman (?) did a production at Tunis last yeas and from what I understand, the Moslems really took to it. 

GEORGE

All right, I?ll tell you what, you seem like a nice guy, let?s stop jerking around. Give me.. two hundred and fifty dollars, I?ve got people waiting for me, I've got to get the hell out of here. 

REICHMAN

Scalping! I told them to put out extra security.. Excuse me. 

GEORGE

Hey pop, would you buzz off, I've got something cooking. 

REICHMAN

Costanza!? 

GEORGE

Mr Reichman? 

REICHMAN

You've still got a mouth like a surd give me those tickets. 

REICHMAN

Harold, no, Harold, Harold be careful of you're hair transplant! 

DIVOLA

Anything is welcome, I accept change. 

JERRY

I don't have anything, I gave it to that guy. 

DIVOLA

You know, you could just say no, you don't have to humiliate me. I may be dressed as a clown but I am a person. 

JERRY

I'm telling you, the guy took..... 

DIVOLA

And I don't need people like you looking down their noses at me. I am just a street performer out here trying to make enough to get by. 

REICHMAN

Doctor! Doctor! Is there a doctor anywhere! 

DIVOLA

What, are you showing off to your girlfriend here, is that it? 

ELAINE

I'm not his girlfriend. We dated for a while, but things didn't really work out. 

DIVOLA

You people make me sick. 

JERRY

That is one angry clown! 

JERRY

The hardest part about being a clown, it seems to me, would be that you're constantly referred to as a clown. 'Who was that clown?', 'I'm not working with that clown, did you hire that clown?', 'The guy's a clown!'. How do you even start into being a clown, how do you know that you want to be a clown, I guess you get to a point where you're pants look so bad, it's actually easier to become a clown than having the proper alterations done. Because if you think about it, a clown, if there isn't a circus around them, is really just a very annoying person. You're in the back seat of this guys Volkswagen, 'What, you're picking somebody else up? Oh man!' 

JERRY

(Singing) Camera, curtains, lights - This is it, we'll hit the heights - Oh what heights we'll hit - On with the show this is it! 

ELAINE

You know, it is so sad, all your knowledge of high culture comes from bugs bunny cartoons. 

JERRY

Oh there's that clown again, what does he want from me. Look I?m serious, I?m not kidding, I don't have the quarter, that guy took it. 

DIVOLA

I don't want any money. 

ELAINE

I smell cherry. 

DIVOLA

It's Binaca. 

JERRY

Binaca? 

GEORGE

What did we say? Two seventy-five? 

GEORGE

Two fifty? Are you sure 

GEORGE

All right, all right, two fifty. 

SUSAN

George! 

GEORGE

S-Susan 

SUSAN

I can't believe it, I?m so glad I caught you. 

GEORGE

What are you doing here, I though you were going to the airport. 

SUSAN

Oh, there was some problem with the plane, they landed in Philadelphia. 

GEORGE

So what, they don?t have another plane? She couldn't take a bus? 

SUSAN

She's coming in tomorrow. I made it! 

GEORGE

Yeah you made it, how about that. 

SUSAN

Oh, I?m so excited, now we get to see the opera together. 

GEORGE

We get to go to the opera together! 

SUSAN

Who's that? 

GEORGE

That?s-that?s-Harry Fong, he's a very good friend of mine and he's a big opera buff. Enjoy the show there harry!... You know what. 

JERRY

Come on, you gotta let us in 

USHER

Not without tickets. 

JERRY

We have tickets, we just don't have 'em with us. 

USHER

Well that?s a problem. Excuse me. 

JERRY

You don't understand, someone's after us, a crazy clown is trying to kill us. 

USHER

A crazy clown is after you? Oh that?s rich. Now clear the entrance so people with tickets can get through. 

ELAINE

We're with him, we're with him. 

KRAMER

Are you guys ready? 

ELAINE

Yeah, Yeah!! 

KRAMER

Have you seen George? 

JERRY

We thought he was with you. 

ELAINE

Come on, he's on his own, come on! 

KRAMER

These are great seats huh? 

ELAINE

Yeah 

KRAMER

Yeah 

JERRY

Boy, some cast, huh? Pavarotti, Aver Martone. 

ELAINE

Aver Martone. I've heard of her, who's she playing? 

JERRY

She's playing, Pagliacci?s wife, Nedda. 

ELAINE

Nedda? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

ELAINE

Oh my god.. 

JERRY

Susan! What are you doing here? 

SUSAN

My Friend's flight couldn?t make it. 

JERRY

Where's George? 

SUSAN

He decided not to come. He said he was uncomfortable. 

JERRY

Uncomfortable? How does you think I feel?.. Hey let me ask you something, how much did you pay for that ticket? 

JERRY

Kramer, who'd you sell your ticket to? 

KRAMER

Some nut in a clown suit! 

JERRY

I had some friends drag me to an opera recently, you know how they've got those little opera glasses, you know, do you really need binoculars, I mean how big do these people have to get before you can spot 'em. These opera kids they're going two-fifty, two-eighty, three-twenty-five, they're wearing big white woolly vests, the women have like the breastplates, the bullet hats with the horn coming out. If you can't pick these people out, forget opera, think about optometry, maybe that?s more you're thing. 

JERRY

We're dead. 

GEORGE

We're not dead. 

JERRY

We are dead. 

GEORGE

Come on. We got all day tomorrow to come up with a story. 

JERRY

All day tomorrow? We had a month and a half to come up with something and we didn't do anything. 

GEORGE

So we'll do it tomorrow. 

JERRY

Let me ask you something. When's the last time you went skiing? 

GEORGE

About six years ago. 

JERRY

I think you can take the lift ticket off your jacket now. 

GEORGE

Women like skiers. 

JERRY

So what? You can't meet anybody. You're going on with Susan. 

GEORGE

Yeah. Right. 

JERRY

Hey, see those two women over there? I almost dated the one on the right. She's in the closet business. 

GEORGE

The closet business? What's the closet business? 

JERRY

What is it your business? 

GEORGE

I'm interested. 

JERRY

She reorganizes your closet and shows you how to maximize your closet space. She looked into my closet. 

GEORGE

So you thought she was good looking and figured this would be a good way to meet her. 

JERRY

Yeah. 

GEORGE

Yeah. So what happened? 

JERRY

So, she mentioned she had a boyfriend and then it hit me. What do I need more closet space for? (Across the room) Hi, Marla. 

MARLA

(Walks over to Jerry and George) Jerry. 

JERRY

George, Marla. 

GEORGE

Marla. 

MARLA

George. Jerry, Stacey. 

JERRY

Stacey. 

STACEY

Jerry. 

JERRY

George, Stacey. 

GEORGE

Stacey. 

STACEY

George. 

JERRY

George. 

GEORGE

Jerry. Marla. (Realizing Jerry's cue) Stacey! (Walks over to Stacey) 

MARLA

So, how was your trip to Berlin? 

JERRY

Trip to Berlin? 

MARLA

Remember? That's why you put off doing the closets. You said you were going to Berlin for a while. 

JERRY

Oh, right, right. 

MARLA

The wall had just come down, and you told me you wanted to be part of the celebration. 

JERRY

Yes, yes, I did. But, you know, I was watching it on CNN, and they covered it so well I thought, 'Why knock my brains out?' 

MARLA

You, know my boyfriend went. 

JERRY

Really? 

MARLA

Yes, I told him all about you going and he got all excited and decided to go. 

JERRY

Oh, did he like it? 

MARLA

I don't know. He never came back. (Over to the other side of the bar) 

GEORGE

Anyway, we met with NBC about a month ago and they gave us the green light to go ahead and write a pilot. In fact, we got a big meeting with them tomorrow. They gotta approve of the story before we can write. 

STACEY

Wow, what a great job. A writer. 

GEORGE

Not a bad way to make a buck. 

STACEY

Sounds great. 

GEORGE

Well, I'll tell you, Stacey. It's a lot of hard work. But, it comes fairly easy to me. Some people write symphonies. This is my gift. (Raises ski lift ticket while Stacey looks away) 

JERRY

So, are you gonna go out with her? 

GEORGE

I might. 

JERRY

What about Susan? 

GEORGE

What? I'm not married. I'm not allowed to go out with somebody else? 

JERRY

Depends. 

GEORGE

Depends on what? 

JERRY

On many factors. 

GEORGE

Like what? 

JERRY

Well, how long you've been seeing her. What's your phone call frequency? Are you on a daily? 

GEORGE

No. Semi-daily. Four or five times a week. 

JERRY

What about Saturday nights? Do you have to ask her out, or is a date implied? 

GEORGE

Implied. 

JERRY

She got anything in your medicine cabinet? 

GEORGE

There might be some moisturizer. 

JERRY

Ah hah. Let me ask you this. Is there any tampax in your house? 

GEORGE

(Pause) Yeah. 

JERRY

Well, I'll tell you what you've got here. 

GEORGE

What? 

JERRY

You got yourself a girlfriend. 

GEORGE

Ah, no, no. Are you sure? A girlfriend? 

JERRY

I'm looking at a guy in a semi-daily with tampax in his house and an implied date on Saturday night. I would like to help you out, but... 

GEORGE

Would you believe my luck? The first time in my life I have a good answer to the question, 'What do you do?' and I have a girlfriend. I mean, you don't need a girlfriend when you can answer that question. That's what you say in order to get girlfriends. Once you can get a girlfriend, you don't want a girlfriend, you just want more girlfriends. 

JERRY

You're going to make a good father someday. 

GEORGE

Well it's not fair, Jerry. It's just not fair. All right, all right. That's it. I'm getting out of this thing. 

JERRY

Fine. Break up with her. But you know what this means? 

GEORGE

No, what? 

JERRY

The script, the pilot, the TV show. That's all over. 

GEORGE

Why? What do you mean? 

JERRY

Figure it out. She's one of the executives at NBC that's gonna make the decision whether or not they pick up the show. She's one of our biggest fans. You drop her off, you think they're gonna pick us up? 

GEORGE

Oh, right. Oh no, man. 

JERRY

you know, it's a very interesting situation. Here you have a job that can get you girls. But, you also have a relationship. But if you try and get rid of the relationship so you can get the girls, you lose the job. You see the irony? 

GEORGE

Yeah, yeah. I see the irony. All right. What about this? What if I can find some way to break up with her so that she'll still like me and it doesn't affect the deal. 

JERRY

(sarcastically) Oh, yeah. 

GEORGE

Wait, wait. Here me out. Don't dismiss this. You're very quick to dismiss. Don't dismiss. She's got a big crush on David Letterman, I mean, a big crush. She talks about him all the time. Suppose I go up to David Letterman. He works at NBC; I work at NBC. I explain my situation. He agrees to meet her. They go out, they fall madly in love. And she dumps me for David Letterman. 

JERRY

This is your plan? 

GEORGE

No, no. I'm just thinking. 

JERRY

I don't think you are. 

MARLA

Let me tell you what I think. 

JERRY

Please, and be brutal. I have no closet sensitivity. 

MARLA

Are you very fussy about your pants? 

JERRY

I don't think I am. 

MARLA

Because I have a very radical idea. Can you handle it? 

JERRY

Try me. 

MARLA

Here's what I'm proposing. We eliminate all this. The hangers, the bar, the shelves. And in its place install a series of hooks. We'll put everything on hooks. 

JERRY

Everything? 

MARLA

Everything. The shirts, pants, sport jackets, pajamas. We could get eighty hooks on here. 

JERRY

You're quite mad, you know. (Kramer enters) Oh, I don't believe this. (Goes into other room) Hey? 

KRAMER

Hey. 

JERRY

What are you doing? 

KRAMER

I'm watching The Bold and the Beautiful. 

JERRY

No. 

KRAMER

What? 

JERRY

This is not a good time. 

KRAMER

Five minutes. What? 

JERRY

What did you have to give your TV away to George for? 

KRAMER

Because I've been watching too much. It was an addiction. I couldn't stop. It was, it was destroying my brain cells. 

JERRY

Yeah, but now you're in here all the time. (Marla enters from other room) 

KRAMER

Well, wow. 

JERRY

Marla, Kramer. 

KRAMER

Hey. 

JERRY

Why don't you go out? It's nice out. 

KRAMER

Oh, no. There's nothing out there for me. 

JERRY

There's weather. 

KRAMER

Weather? I don't need weather. Weather doesn't do it for me. 

JERRY

I'm tellin' George to give you your TV back. 

KRAMER

No, no, I don't want it back. (Pause) Are you gonna watch the Knick game tonight? 

JERRY

I don't know. 

KRAMER

Will you tape it? 

JERRY

Kramer... (points to Marla) 

KRAMER

Yeah. (He exits) 

JERRY

So your boyfriend never came back from Berlin. 

MARLA

Never came back. 

JERRY

Oh, you must have been devastated being left for a wall. 

MARLA

It was about to end anyway. There was this... problem. 

JERRY

Ah hah. (Buzzer) Excuse me one second. Yeah? 

ELAINE

It's me. 

JERRY

Come on up. Oh, it's Elaine, she's just a friend of mine. I don't know what she's doing here now. (Buzzer) I'm sorry. What? 

ELAINE

I didn't get it. 

JERRY

Ugh. So you were saying there was this problem. 

MARLA

Well, he wanted me to move in with him. 

JERRY

Snapple? 

MARLA

No thanks. 

JERRY

Go on. 

MARLA

Well I wouldn't move in because... 

JERRY

Yes. 

MARLA

Well because... 

JERRY

Yeah. 

MARLA

Well because I'm a virgin. (Elaine enters) 

ELAINE

Hello! 

JERRY

Hi, um. Marla, Elaine. 

ELAINE

I'm sorry, I didn't know you had company. I just wanted to return your tape. 

JERRY

Oh, thanks a lot, two weeks late. Now that costs me thirty-five dollars to see Havana. 

ELAINE

I'm sorry, I really am. I just kept forgetting. 

MARLA

I should be going. 

ELAINE

No, no, I'm leaving. 

JERRY

I like that thing in your hair there. 

ELAINE

Oh yeah? This woman was selling them at this crazy party I was at last night. You'll appreciate this. Snapple? 

MARLA

No thanks. 

ELAINE

I was talking to this guy, you know, and I just happened to throw my purse on the sofa. And my diaphragm goes flying out. So I just froze, you know, ahh! Staring at my diaphragm. You know, it's just lying there. So then, this woman, the one who sold me this hair thing, she grabbed it before the guy noticed, so. I mean, big deal, right? So I carry around my diaphragm, who doesn't? Yeah, like it's a big, big secret that women carry around their diaphragms. You never know when you're gonna need it, right? (Sips the Snapple) Ahh. 

MARLA

I should be going. 

JERRY

So we'll talk about the hooks then? 

MARLA

Yes. (She exits) 

ELAINE

What? Was it something I said? 

JERRY

She's a virgin, she just told me. 

ELAINE

Well I didn't know. 

JERRY

Well it's not like spotting a toupee. 

ELAINE

Well you think I should say something? Should I say something? Should I apologize? Was I being anti-virgin? 

JERRY

No, no, I mean... 

ELAINE

'Cause I'm not anti-virgin. I'll be right back. (She leaves) 

JERRY

Elaine, Elaine... (Buzzer) Yeah? 

GEORGE

It's George. 

GEORGE

She's a virgin? 

JERRY

A virgin. 

GEORGE

Wow. So what're you gonna do? 

JERRY

I don't know. I'm very attracted to her. That accent, it's so sexy. 

GEORGE

I don't think I could do it. You know, they always remember the first time. I don't want to be remembered. I wanna be forgotten. 

JERRY

You need a little pioneer spirit. You know, you don't have any of that Lewis and Clark in you. 

GEORGE

You know, sometimes those guys don't make it back. (Looks in fridge) I'm really hungry. 

JERRY

Yeah, me too. 

GEORGE

We gotta get something. I don't want to go to that meeting on an empty stomach. Let's get some Chinese. You wanna order it? 

JERRY

All right, but then we gotta get some work done. Let me just call Kramer, see if want anything. (Calls) Hey, we ordering Chinese food. If you want anything-- (Kramer enters quickly) let me know what it is and I'll order for you. 

KRAMER

I'm in. Let's go for it. 

GEORGE

What do you want? 

KRAMER

I don't care, whatever. 

GEORGE

I'll tell you what. Why don't we just get a couple of dishes and we'll just share 'em. 

KRAMER

Okay. What are you getting? 

GEORGE

I'm gonna get a Chow Fung. 

KRAMER

What's a Chow Fung? 

GEORGE

It's a broad noodle. 

KRAMER

What do you mean, a broad noodle? 

GEORGE

It's a big flat noodle. 

KRAMER

Well I don't want a big flat noodle. 

GEORGE

What kind of noodle do you want? 

KRAMER

Who says I want a noodle? 

GEORGE

All right, look. I'm getting the Chow Fung. You don't have to have any. 

KRAMER

All right. I'll get pea pods and you can't have any of my pea pods. 

GEORGE

Fine. 

KRAMER

Get extra MSG. 

ELAINE

Look, Marla. This whole sex thing is totally overrated. Now, here's the one thing you've gotta be ready for is how the man changes into a completely different person five seconds after it's over. I mean, something happens to their personality it's really quite astounding. It's like they committed a crime and they want to flee the scene before the police get there. 

MARLA

So they just leave? 

ELAINE

Yeah, pretty much, yeah. Well, the smart ones start working on their getaway stories during dinner. How, you know, they gotta get up early tomorrow. What is about being up early? They all turn into farmers suddenly. 

MARLA

Wow. It must be pretty good to put up with all that. 

ELAINE

Eh. 

JERRY

All right, let's go. We don't have much time before the meeting. 

GEORGE

Where's the food? What happened to Ping? 

JERRY

Don't worry, he'll be here. Look, we only got about two hours. We just need to come up with one good story so we can get through this meeting. (Buzzer) There's your food. 

GEORGE

Hey, what about this? I'm in a car accident. The motorist is uninsured, you with me? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

GEORGE

My car's totaled. It's all his fault and now, he has absolutely no money. There is no way that he can pay me. So the judge decrees that he becomes my butler. 

JERRY

Your butler? 

GEORGE

Right. He cooks my food, he cleans my house, he does all my shopping for me. And there you go, that's your program. 

JERRY

What about me? 

GEORGE

Don't worry, we'll find something for you. (Knock of Jerry's door) 

JERRY

(Getting the door) That's the stupidest idea I ever heard. Sentenced to be a butler. (Elaine, Marla, and an injured Ping are at the door) Ping, what happened? 

ELAINE

There was a bit of an accident. 

PING

Head hurts. Head really hurts. 

JERRY

What happened? 

ELAINE

Marla and I went out for coffee and afterwards I was crossing the street and he was biking right towards me. So I got out of the way just in time, but then he ran into a parked car. He hit his head and everything went flying. 

GEORGE

Something happened to the food? 

PING

I only saved one bag. 

JERRY

Should I call an ambulance? Do you wanna see a doctor? 

MARLA

I'll get some ice. 

GEORGE

(After looking in the bag) The pea pods? All you saved was the pea pods? (Kramer enters) 

KRAMER

Hey, you got the food? 

JERRY

Yeah, here. 

KRAMER

What took you so long? Hey, Ping! 

PING

Kramer. (Kramer and George sit on the couch) 

KRAMER

Yeah. Where's yours? 

GEORGE

He dropped it. 

KRAMER

Oh, that's too bad. 

ELAINE

You should slow down, you know that? It's dangerous to go that fast. 

PING

No, no. I have green light. You jaywalked. 

KRAMER

(To Jerry) Hey, you watchin' Oprah? 

ELAINE

(To Ping) I did not jaywalk. 

JERRY

(To George) You're givin' him back that TV. 

PING

(To Elaine) Yes, you jaywalked. 

KRAMER

(To Jerry) No, I don't want it back. 

PING

(To Elaine) Jaywalker. I could slap suit on you. 

GEORGE

(To Jerry) We got work to do. What about the meeting? 

KRAMER

(To himself) Hey, look. An hour with Patrick Swayze. 

JERRY

A month and a half we had. We did nothing. I can't believe we put it off until today and then we couldn't do anything because Elaine runs out to apologize to a virgin, crosses against a light, and knocks over a Chinese delivery boy. Now we're gonna make fools of ourselves, we got nothing. You're not even in show business. I gotta reputation. You drag me into the sewer with you. I've been on TV buddy boy. You know how fast word spreads in show business? It's like that (Snaps in George's face) , like that! One bad impression, you're outta the business! 

GEORGE

All right, let's postpone it. Let's get out of here. 

JERRY

What do you mean? They know we're here. 

GEORGE

I'll fake an illness. (Acts it out) My back! My back! I can't believe, my back. 

JERRY

No, no, would you get up? 

GEORGE

I can do this, Jerry. 

JERRY

No. 

GEORGE

All right, I'll tell them my sister died. (Starts fake crying) My poor sister died. She was standing and then she was laughing and then they SHOT her! That's the kind of sick city that we're livin' in. They shoot you for laughing. I must go and comfort my poor family. Jerry, take me home so I can comfort my... my poor family. 

JERRY

What? 

GEORGE

That's David Letterman. I just saw David Letterman walk by. I'll be right back. (He exits) 

WOMAN

Mr. Seinfeld, they're ready for you. (She exits) 

JERRY

Yes, I was very wise to hitch my wagon to his star. (Jerry enters meeting) 

JERRY

Hi, how are you doing? Nice to see you all here. Hello. 

RITA

Hello, Jerry. I'm Rita Kearson. 

JERRY

Oh, uh, nice to meet you. Where's Russell? 

RITA

He, uh, had to go to LA. There's a problem on the set of Blossom. 

JERRY

Oh, poor Blossom. (He sits) 

RITA

Anyway, he asked me to sit in for him. 

JERRY

Oh, he ran to say something to David Letterman. 

SUSAN

David Letterman's on the floor? 

JERRY

Yeah, he just walked by. 

RITA

Well, I think we should get started anyway. 

JERRY

Yeah, good idea. 

RITA

So how are you guys comin' along? 

JERRY

Good, good, we've got a lot of ideas. 

RITA

Good. (Pause) 

JERRY

Have you ever been to a Chinese restaurant and they tell you it'll be, like, five minutes for a table and you wind up waitin' there for, like, thirty minutes? Well, we thought it would be very funny to do an entire show where all you're doin' is waitin' for the table. (They don't seem to like it) Because we've all been in that situation. You know, you're waiting... and you're hungry... and you bump into somebody you know... When is Russell coming back? 

RITA

So that's the idea? 

JERRY

Well no, that's one. We have many others. We have an idea where, uh, I get into an accident with a guy who has no insurance and the judge sentences him to be my butler. (Everyone laughs) You know he cooks for me, he has to cook for me... He cleans my house, he's doin' my shopping, you know? I'm walkin' around with one of those big neck collars. 

GEORGE

You tellin' 'em about the butler story? Is that beautiful or what? Hey, sorry I'm late. (Looks at Rita) Russell? 

RITA

I'm Rita Kearson. 

GEORGE

Oh, Rita. Hey, Mr. Shermack, how're you doing, good to see you. Jay, always a pleasure. (To Susan) Sweetie. (Kisses her and then sits down next to Jerry) Yeah, yeah, that butler idea, that's beautiful. Isn't that killer? (Aside to Jerry) I thought I was getting the butler. 

JERRY

Don't worry, uh, we'll find something for you. 

JERRY

So Letterman didn't spark to your idea, huh? 

GEORGE

No, he said there was nothing he could do, and next time I should probably break the Prozacs in half. 

KRAMER

You, you guys wanna hold it down? I'm watchin' Jeopardy. 

JERRY

Would you give him the TV back? 

KRAMER

Oh, by the way, George. Susan called for you a minute ago. 

GEORGE

I bet they're probably doing summersaults about us over there. You think they get butler stories like that everyday? (He calls Susan) 

KRAMER

(To the TV) Who is Joseph Cotton? Giddee up! 

SUSAN

Hello? 

GEORGE

Hi, it's me. It's Georgie Boy. What's going on? 

SUSAN

What's going on? What's going on? I'll tell you what's going on. I'm fired! 

GEORGE

Fired? Why? 

SUSAN

Because you kissed me. You kissed me, you stupid idiot! Rita called Russell and he fired me over the phone. 

KRAMER

(To the TV) What is pi? Ooh! Giddee up again. 

GEORGE

But I had no... I didn't realize. 

SUSAN

You didn't realize? How could you not realize? You're stupid! You're a stupid, stupid man! 

GEORGE

I just feel terrible This is just terrible. 

KRAMER

(To the TV once again) What is the cha-cha? Ooh, yes indeed. 

SUSAN

I'll speak to you later. 

GEORGE

(Hangs up phone and pauses) this is great! He fired her! This is incredible, he fired her. I'm out, baby! I'm out! 

JERRY

Why did he fire her? 

GEORGE

Because I kissed her in the meeting. Russell found out, he fired her over the phone. Finally, my stupidity pays off! 

KRAMER

What is here comes the judge, here comes the judge! 

JERRY

You can't break up with her now. Her life is shattered. You got her fired. You gotta be there for her. 

GEORGE

What? 

JERRY

You gotta at least wait until she gets another job. 

GEORGE

Another job? 

JERRY

Couple of interviews. 

GEORGE

Oh, this is unbelievable. I'm stuck. Every time I think I'm out, they pull me back in. 

MARLA

Are you gonna leave after its over? You know, if we have sex. 

JERRY

What? Leave? Where? Why? 

MARLA

You know, the apartment. 

JERRY

Why would I leave? This is my apartment. 

MARLA

Well what if it was my apartment? 

JERRY

Who gave you this idea I would wanna leave? 

MARLA

Well Elaine said men like to leave after it's over. 

JERRY

Listen, I wouldn't put too much stock into what Elaine has to say about relationships. She comes from a broken home, and I mean that literally. A tree fell on her roof and cracked the whole structure. Her parents got along beautifully, but her house was in bad shape. 

MARLA

Maybe I should get going. 

JERRY

What else did you say to her? 

ELAINE

Nothin'. I was just givin' her the straight dope. 

JERRY

More like a dope was giving it to her straight. Another cup of coffee with you, she'll wind up in a convent. 

ELAINE

Listen, there was a lot more I could've told her, believe me. 

JERRY

What is that about leaving after sex? Did I ever leave with you? 

ELAINE

You might've if I'd stayed. So you know what? I got served with papers today. Ping is suing me. I need your virgin as a witness. You better be nice to her. 

JERRY

I was trying to be. 

ELAINE

Look at George. (On the other side of the restaurant) He lucked out, huh? 

JERRY

Oh, you're not kiddin'. Who'd 've figured Susan would break up with him? They had a good thing going. 

ELAINE

Yeah, since she met him she's been vomited on, her family cabin's been burned down, she learned her father's a homosexual, and she got fired from a high paying network job. Yeah, they had a real good thing going. 

GEORGE

What do I do? Well actually, I'm a writer. In fact, I'm writing a comedy pilot for NBC right now. 

WOMAN

A sitcom? How can you write that crap? Carol, this guy's writing a sitcom. 

CAROL

A sitcom? Come on, let's go. (They leave) 

WOMAN

A sitcom. Can you imagine? And he actually tried to use it to hit on me! 

JERRY

(To Elaine) Let me ask you a question.  

ELAINE

Mm-hm.  

JERRY

You're a hostage, captured by terrorists-  

ELAINE

(Smiling, chewing) Who, me?  

JERRY

You, anybody - whatever. You're in the little room, you're chained to the floor, you're there for a long time.. do you think they would ever consider doing the laundry?  

ELAINE

(Matter-of-factly) They have to, it's in the Geneva Convention.  

KRAMER

(Imitating a Turkish terrorist) You! Take off your socks, your pants, your underwear. We're doing the wash. C'mon! Take it off, take it off!  

KRAMER

Hey, Georgie.  

ELAINE

Hi.  

JERRY

(To George) What's the matter?  

GEORGE

(Slowly shakes his head) My mother caught me.  

JERRY

'Caught' you? Doing what?  

GEORGE

You know. (All three give him blank stares) I was alone..  

ELAINE

(Making a face of surprise) You mean..?!  

GEORGE

(Nods) Uh-huh.  

KRAMER

(Laughing) She caught you?  

JERRY

Where?  

GEORGE

(Not really wanting to embellish) ..I stopped by the house to drop the car off, and I went inside for a few minutes.. Nobody was there - they're supposed to be working. (Jerry and Elaine look at each other - enjoying the story) My mother had a Glamour magazine, I started leafing through it..  

JERRY

'Glamour'?  

GEORGE

..So, one thing lead to another..  

JERRY

So, what did she do?  

GEORGE

First she screams, 'George, what are you doing?! My God!' And it looked like she was gonna faint - she started clutching the wall, trying to hang onto it.  

KRMAER

(Reflecting on the story so far) Man..  

GEORGE

I didn't know whether to try and keep her from falling, or zip up.  

JERRY

What did you do?  

GEORGE

I zipped up!  

ELAINE

(Wide-eyed) So, she fell?  

GEORGE

Yeah. (Noticing this makes him out to be the bad kid, he gets defensive) Well, I couldn't run over there the way I was!  

ELAINE

No, I guess you couldn't have..  

JERRY

(In the middle of Elaine's sentence, smiling) No, I wouldn't think so.  

ELAINE

(Finishing it off) ..done that.  

GEORGE

So, she fell, and then she started screaming, 'My back! My back!' So, I picked her up and took her to the hospital.  

ELAINE

(Between chuckles) How is she?  

GEORGE

(Somewhat angered) She's in traction.  

ELAINE

(Still laughing) Ok, I'm sorry.  

GEORGE

It's not funny, Elaine.  

ELAINE

(Stifling her laughter) I know. I'm sorry. I'm serious.  

GEORGE

Her back went out. She's gotta be there for a couple of days. All she said on the way over in the car was, 'Why, George, why?!'.. I said, 'Because it's there!'  

JERRY

'Glamour'?  

GEORGE

(Vowing) Well, I'll tell you this, though - I am never doing.. that , again.  

ELAINE

What, you mean, in your mother's house, or all together?  

GEORGE

(Definite) All together.  

ELAINE

Oh, gimme a break..  

JERRY

(Skeptical) Ohhh yeah.. right.  

KRAMER

Oh, like you're gonna stop?  

ELAINE

C'mon..  

GEORGE

You don't think I can?  

JERRY

No chance.  

GEORGE

(Daring) You think you could?  

JERRY

Well, I know I could hold out longer than you.  

GEORGE

Care to make it interesting?  

JERRY

Sure, how much?  

GEORGE

A hundred dollars.  

JERRY

(Pointing) You're on.  

KRAMER

(Butting in) Wait a second, wait a second. Count me in on this. (Clicks his tongue)  

JERRY

You?  

KRAMER

Yeah.  

JERRY

You'll be out before we get the check.  

ELAINE

(Smiling) I want to be in on this, too.  

JERRY

(Rejecting) Ohh, no. No, no, no..  

ELAINE

Why?  

JERRY

(Showing difference) It's apples and oranges..  

ELAINE

What? Why? (More 'no, no, no's from Jerry and George. Persistent) Why?  

JERRY

Because you're a woman!  

ELAINE

So what?  

JERRY

It's easier for a woman not to do it than a man.  

ELAINE

(Sarcastic) Oh.  

JERRY

We have to do it. It's part of our lifestyle. It's like, uh.. shaving.  

ELAINE

Oh, that is such bologna. I shave my legs.  

KRAMER

(Making a point) Not everyday.  

GEORGE

Alright, look, you want to be in?  

ELAINE

Yeah!  

GEORGE

You gotta give us odds. At least two to one - you gotta put up two-hundred dollars.  

KRAMER

No, a thousand!  

ELAINE

No, I'll - I'll put up one-fifty.  

GEORGE

Alright, you're in for one-fifty.  

JERRY

(Nodding) Okay, one-fifty.  

GEORGE

Alright, now, how are we gonna monitor this thing?  

JERRY

Well, obviously, we all know each other very well, (Elaine slightly laughs) I'm sure that we'll all feel comfortable within the confines of the honor system.  

KRAMER

Alright. (Holds out his pinkie at the center of the table)  

GEORGE

(Stern) No, ma, I'm not gonna see a psychiatrist. N- I don't care if you do pay for it! No! Discussion over. Yeah, alright, I'll see you later. Yes, of course I'm gonna come by. Alright. (Hangs up, slamming it down on the coffee table. He sits down next to Jerry) My mother wants me to see a psychiatrist now. Why?! Because she caught me? (Scoffs, shaking his head) You know, if everyone who did that had to go see a psychiatrist.. (Laughing, he snorts)  

JERRY

(Waits for the rest of the sentence) ..Yeah?  

GEORGE

(Defensively) Whatever.  

JERRY

How is she?  

GEORGE

(Shrugging it off) She'll be fine. I gotta go to the hospital to see her tonight.  

JERRY

(Answering to the intercom) Yeah?  

ELAINE

It's me.  

JERRY

Come on up. (Lets her in by unlocking the front door)  

GEORGE

Hey, what are you doing tonight?  

JERRY

(Opens his door slightly for Elaine) Dating Marla.  

GEORGE

Oh, the virgin?  

JERRY

Yeah.  

GEORGE

Any, uh.. progress, there? What's the latest?  

JERRY

Well, I got my troops amassed along the border - I'm just waiting for someone to give me the go-ahead.  

KRAMER

Hey, look at this, c'mere. There's a naked woman across the street.  

JERRY

Where?  

KRAMER

Second floor from the top. (Pointing) See the window on the left?  

GEORGE

(In awe) Wow!  

JERRY

(Also amazed) Who walks around the house like that?!  

GEORGE

(Suggesting) Maybe she's a nudist. You know, those nudist colony people..  

KRAMER

..Yeah.. (Pause) yeah.. (Slowly stands up, and walks out Jerry's apartment - leaving Jerry and George with the view, he shuts the door behind him)  

JERRY

Hey, let me ask you a question. In these nudist colonies, do they eat naked in the dining room?  

GEORGE

I would imagine it's all naked.  

JERRY

What about the chamber maids? Are they naked, too?  

GEORGE

(Still focused on the nudist) They're naked, the gardeners naked.. the bellhops. (Jerry makes a noise of astonishment) One big nude-a-rama.  

ELAINE

Hey.  

GEORGE

(Only turning back for a second) Hey.  

ELAINE

Well, (Smiling) where's my money? Who caved?  

JERRY

(Over his shoulder) Not me.  

GEORGE

(Also, over his shoulder) Not me.  

ELAINE

What're you looking at?  

JERRY

There's a naked woman across the street.  

ELAINE

(Smiling, chuckling) This is gonna be the easiest money I've ever made in my life. (Moving on to a new topic) So, my fried, Joyce, is teaching an aerobics class. I'm gonna go tonight.  

JERRY

(Commenting) Yeah.. the - the waitress should've taken it back.  

ELAINE

(Realizes Jerry and George aren't paying attention) So then, I got a call this morning. You know, I was, uh, chosen to go on the space shuttle. We're goin' to Mars.  

JERRY

(Still staring at the woman) Uh-huh.  

GEORGE

Have a good time.  

KRAMER

(Declaring) I'm out!  

ELAINE

What?!  

KRAMER

Yeah, I'm out - I'm out of the contest.  

GEORGE

You're out?!  

KRAMER

Yeah, yeah.. (Notes their reactions) what?  

ELAINE

Well, that was fast!  

JERRY

Well, it was that woman across the street. (To Jerry) You know, you better be careful, buddy. She's gonna get you next. (Walks out, shutting the door behind him)  

ELAINE

..And then there were three.  

ESTELLE

I don't understand you. I really don't. You have nothing better to do at three o' clock in the afternoon? I go out for a quart of milk, I come home, and find my son treating his body like it was an amusement park!  

GEORGE

(Stern, trying to shut her up) Ma.  

ESTELLE

Don't give me 'Ma'. It's a good thing I didn't hit the table. I could of cracked my head open.  

GEORGE

Ma, people can hear you.  

ESTELLE

(Heavy in sarcasm) Too bad you can't do that for a living. You'd be very successful at it. You could sell out Madison Square Garden. Thousands of people could watch you! You could be a big star!  

GEORGE

(Getting up) Alright, Ma, that's enough!  

ESTELLE

I want you to go see a psychiatrist.  

GEORGE

No! I am not going to see a psychiatrist!  

ESTELLE

Why? Why not?! Why won't you go?  

GEORGE

(Like a kid) Because I don't want to.  

ESTELLE

I want you to go see somebody.  

GEORGE

Well, I am not going.  

ESTELLE

It's a good thing your father's in Chicago.  

SHELLY

Hello, Aunt Estelle. Look at you - how did this happen?  

GEORGE

(Snapping) Is that important, really? What is this, a police investigation? The woman's been through enough. She has to relive the experience now?!  

NURSE

Hi, Denise. Six-thirty, time for your sponge bath.  

DENISE

Mmm.. is it six-thirty already? I fell asleep.  

SHELLY

(Seems not to notice what's going on beyond the divider) So, George, what are you doing now? I hear you got some kinda television, writing - thing?  

GEORGE

(Slowly backing away, he's not at all committed to the conversation) Yeah.. television.  

NURSE

Let me help you out with that. Here, just slip it over your head..  

DENISE

Oh.. thank you.  

SHELLY

(Nodding) Well, it's about time. We thought you were gonna wind up on the street. (As the bath is going on, George is now completely mesmerized) What is it you're doing, exactly?  

ESTELLE

George, you're cousin, Shelly, is talking to you!  

JOYCE

So, when was the last time you took a class?  

ELAINE

Oh, it's been a while.  

JOYCE

(Overly excited) Are you psyched?  

ELAINE

(Fake excitement) Yeah. yeah, I'm really.. psyched.  

JOYCE

Well, you're gonna thank me for getting you in here.  

ELAINE

Why is that?  

JOYCE

(Pointing, she directs Elaine's attention off-camera) See the guy with the dark hair and the red shorts?  

ELAINE

(Between breaths) Oh, my God. (Joyce nods) John F. Kennedy Junior's here!  

JOYCE

He's gonna be in your class today.  

ELAINE

(Still unable to speak right) In my class? John Kennedy's gonna be in my class?!  

JOYCE

I can get you a spot right behind him. He has got a great butt.  

ELAINE

Yeah. Butt. Butt. Great butt. John-John's butt.  

MARLA

Let's slow it down a little.  

JERRY

'Slow it down'?  

MARLA

Well, (Reminding him of her virginity) You know..  

JERRY

Ah, yeah.. I know.  

MARLA

You're okay with that, right?  

JERRY

Yeah, yeah.. of course. What, do you think I care about the sex? What kind of person do you think I am? That doesn't mean anything to me. (Faint) I don't care about that.  

MARLA

So, I'll see you Saturday night, then?  

JERRY

(Smiling, nodding) Sure, Saturday night.  

MARLA

Alright, then. Good night.  

JERRY

Goodnight. (She gets out. Jerry leans forward, adding) Not just a good night - a great night. (She shuts the door, he waves)  

KRAMER

(Singing) Goood Moorrrnninng!  

JERRY

(Out of it) Yeah, good morning.  

KRAMER

Ha, ha! Nothing like some good solid sack time. (Turns toward Jerry's window)  

JERRY

She's not there. She's doin' her wash.  

KRAMER

(Turning back to Jerry) Oh. So, did you make it through the night?  

JERRY

(Over the top) Yes, I'm proud to say I did!  

KRAMER

So, you're still master of your domain.  

JERRY

(Nodding) Yes. Yes I am. (Kramer chuckles) Master of my domain. But I will tell you this: I am going over to (Gestures to the nudist) her apartment, and I'm tellin' her to put those shades down!  

KRAMER

Woah, woah, woah. What-what did you just say?  

JERRY

I can't take it anymore! She's driving me crazy! I can't sleep, I can't leave the house, and I' here, I'm climbin' the walls. Meanwhile, I'm dating a virgin, I'm in this contest - something's gotta give!  

KRAMER

Do you hear what you're saying?! Can you hear it?! (Jerry puts on his coat) This is a beautiful woman walking around naked, and you want to tell her to stop?! That's the dumbest thing I ever heard! I mean, think comprehens- I'm not gonna let you do it.  

JERRY

(Persistent) Well, I'm doin' it, get out of my way.  

KRAMER

(Stopping him) No, no, no, no. You can't! You can't! This is something that comes about once in a lifetime! When we were boys, looking through our bedroom windows, we would think: 'Why can't there be a woman out there, taking her clothes off?' And now that wish's come true, and you want to (Makes a noise) throw it away?!  

JERRY

Look, I'm sorry-  

KRAMER

No, I'm not gonna let you do it, Jerry.  

JERRY

Kramer, (Trying to pass him) get outta my way!  

KRAMER

(Frantic) No, no, no. Don't do it. Don't do it! For my sake! God knows I don't ask you for much! (Pleading) Now, come on. Please, Jerry. Please! I'm beggin' ya! Please! (Claps hands) Come on! Please!  

JERRY

Alright.. (Takes his coat off)  

KRAMER

Yes!  

JERRY

..Alright.  

KRAMER

(Moving to the window) Thank you, thank you, thank you. (Sits in Jerry's chair, looking out the window)  

JERRY

She's not there!  

KRAMER

Oh, I can wait..  

JERRY

So the nurse was giving her a sponge bath?  

GEORGE

Every night at six-thirty. The nurse was gorgeous.. then I got a look at the patient.. (Laughs, then snorts) I was going nuts.  

JERRY

Oh, man. Well, I guess you'll be going back to that hospital.  

GEORGE

(Fake sympathy) Well, my mother, Jerry..  

JERRY

(Pointing) But are you still master of your domain?  

GEORGE

(Arms out) I am king of the county. You?  

JERRY

Lord of the manor.  

ELAINE

John F. Kennedy Jun-ya!  

JERRY

What?  

ELAINE

(Smiling) He was in my aerobics class.  

JERRY

Really? Did you talk to him?  

ELAINE

No, you don't understand - he was working out right in front of me. So, listen, after the class was over, I timed my walk to the door so we'd get there at the exact same moment, and he says to me, (Thinking the world of what he said) 'Quite a workout.'  

GEORGE

'Quite a workout'? What did you say?  

ELAINE

(Smiling, proud) I said, 'yeah.'  

JERRY

(Adding, fake praise) Good one.  

ELAINE

So then, listen, listen. So then, I showered and I dressed, and I saw him again, on the way out. (Giddy and nearly out of breath) So we're walkin' and talkin', and he asked me my name - and I think I said Elaine - but, I mean, who the hell knows.. And so then, he says to me: 'Do you wanna split a cab uptown?' And I said, 'Sure' - even though I was going downtown. So, we get in the cab, and I mean, I have no idea where I'm goin', right? But this is John F. Kennedy Junior we're talkin' about! (Deep breath) So, then, he says to me, 'Where do you live?' And I - and I - and I was close to your block, so I said your building. So he dropped me off in front, (Laughs) and I had to take a cab all the way back downtown to my house.. (Picks up a glass of cold water and presses it up to her forehead to cool her off) Oh, God..  

JERRY

But the question is, are you still master of your domain?  

ELAINE

(Sets the glass down) I'm queen of the castle. (Pops a piece of food into her mouth)  

ESTELLE

You're back.  

GEORGE

Of course I'm back. Why wouldn't I be back? My mother's in the hospital, I'm going to pay her a visit.  

ESTELLE

I know, but two days in a row? You didn't have to do this.  

GEORGE

You're my mother! What wouldn't I do for you?  

ESTELLE

You know what you could do? I haven't eaten lunch or dinner. I can't eat this hospital food. Maybe you could run down to the deli and get me a sandwich..  

GEORGE

(Smiling) You got it, Ma. (She smiles back, nodding) A little later. (George sits back in a nearby chair, looking at the divider in anticipation)  

ESTELLE

(Let down) Could you go now, George? I'm very hungry. I'm weak.  

GEORGE

Well, wait a little while, Ma. What's the difference?  

ESTELLE

I don't understand why you can't do this for me!  

GEORGE

(Standing up) I just got here, Ma! I'd like to spend a little time with you.  

ESTELLE

But if you wait, they won't let you back in! Visiting hours are almost over!  

GEORGE

Ten minutes! Here, here, (Fishes a box of Tic-Tacs out of his coat pocket and tosses them to her) Have some Tic-Tacs.  

ESTELLE

Get the hell outta here. (Angrily sets them aside) I'm sorry you came.  

NURSE

(To patient) Six-thirty. Time for your sponge bath.  

ESTELLE

George.. I'm huuunnnggry!  

GEORGE

(Muttering, slow) Hang on, Ma.. hang on..  

JOYCE

Hi!  

ELAINE

Hi.  

JOYCE

Did you get your hair done today?  

ELAINE

No, I just, uh, fixed it.. a little bit. (Still looking around, she quickly checks her breath)  

JOYCE

You know who - isn't here. He was in the early class today. (Elaine looses her composure) But I think you made quite an impression on him yesterday.  

ELAINE

(Regarding herself) What? What? Who? Me-me-me? I made an impression? What impression?  

JOYCE

Let me just put this back. (Turns to put a stack of shorts away)  

ELAINE

No! No! Now! Tell me now! What did he say?!  

JOYCE

(Uneasy) He asked about you.  

ELAINE

(Ecstatic) He asked about me? John Kennedy asked about me?! (Hangs off the side of the counter, both feet in the air) What did he say?  

JOYCE

He wanted to know your situation.  

ELAINE

(Quick) What situation? I have a situation?  

JOYCE

I-I told him you were single.  

ELAINE

That was good. That was very good.  

JOYCE

He said you were just his type.  

ELAINE

(Frank) Okay, you tryin' to hurt me? Are you tryin' to hurt - you're tryin' to injure me, right? You're trying to hurt me.  

JOYCE

He also told me to tell you that he'll be in your neighborhood tomorrow around nine o' clock - so he's gonna stop in front of your building if you want to come down and say hello.  

JERRY

Alright, Ma, I'll talk to you later.. Nothing, I'm, I'm watching, uh, Tiny Toons here, on Nickelodeon.. It's, I-I like kid shows. They have a very innocent, wholesome quality. Okay, alright, I'll talk to you later. Bye. (Hangs up)  

KRAMER

(Obviously watching the nudist across the street) Oh, that's good. That's good. That's very, very good. Oh, it's hot in there.. (Jerry looks back at Kramer in envy) It's hot in there. So, just walk around a little bit. Don't be ashamed, don't be ashamed.. that's good, that's good.. yes, yes, yes..  

JERRY

(Trying to block out Kramer, he starts to sing along with the TV) The wheels on the bus go round and round, round and round, round and round. The wheels on the bus..  

KRAMER

The woman across the street has nothing on, nothing on, nothing on..  

GEORGE

All you got is instant coffee? Why don't you get some real coffee?  

JERRY

I don't keep real coffee in here, I get my coffee on the outside! (Intercom buzzes. He answers it) Yeah?!  

ELAINE

(Through intercom) It's Elaine.  

JERRY

(Shouting) Come on up! (Opens his door for Elaine)  

GEORGE

Where did you get those socks?  

JERRY

I don't know.  

GEORGE

I think those are my socks!  

JERRY

How are these your socks?!  

GEORGE

I don't know, but those are my socks! I had a pair just like that with the blue stripe, and now I don't have them anymore!  

JERRY

(Sarcastic) Oh, yeah, that's right, well, you fell asleep one day on the sofa and I took them off your stinkin' feet. They looked so good to me, I just had to have them!  

GEORGE

Yeah, well, they're my socks!  

JERRY

They're my socks!  

GEORGE

Oh boy..  

JERRY

What are we doing here..  

GEORGE

..Oh boy.  

JERRY

This is ridiculous.  

GEORGE

Do you believe this? We're fighting. We're fighting.  

JERRY

I haven't been myself lately. I've been snapping at everybody.  

GEORGE

Me too. I've been yelling at strangers on the street.  

ELAINE

Hello.. (Pulls a wad of bills out of her purse, and starts to count it up)  

GEORGE

(Shocked) You caved?!  

JERRY

It's over?  

GEORGE

You're out?  

JERRY

Ohh-my-God. The Queen is dead.  

GEORGE

I figured you'd cruise. At least through the Spring.  

JERRY

What happened?  

ELAINE

It was..uh.. John-John.  

GEORGE

Ohhhhh.. John-John.  

JERRY

But you made it through the day before.  

ELAINE

Yeah, but yesterday, he told Joyce, the aerobics teacher, that he wants to meet me outside here at nine o' clock tonight.  

JERRY

Why outside here?  

ELAINE

Because he think I live here. Remember when we shared a cab, and he dropped me off out in front? He's picking me up.  

JERRY

Alright, Costanza - it's just you and me.  

GEORGE

And then, (Smacks the money) there were two.  

ELAINE

(Slowly) Elaine Benes Kennedy Junior..  

MARLA

Let's go in the bedroom.  

JERRY

Really?  

MARLA

Yes.  

JERRY

You sure?  

MARLA

Yes.  

JERRY

You really want to?  

MARLA

I do. I'm ready.  

JERRY

Okay..  

MARLA

I know how difficult this must have been for you.  

JERRY

(Chuckles) You don't know the half of it.  

MARLA

What do you mean?  

JERRY

Well, it's kinda silly, but..  

MARLA

Contest?! A contest! This is what you do with your friends?  

JERRY

No, it was just a bet. I mean, it actually started with George and his mother-  

MARLA

I don't want to hear another word. And to think how close I came to you being the one! I must have been out of my mind.  

ELAINE

Marla? Hi, oh, I'm glad I ran into you-  

MARLA

I don't want to have anything to do with you or your perverted friends. (Confused, Elaine moves closer) Ooohh, get away from me! You're horrible.  

ELAINE

What happened?  

JERRY

I told her about the contest.  

ELAINE

Ohh. Boy, she's a whack-o.  

GEORGE

(To Elaine) Hey, what happened?  

ELAINE

What?  

GEORGE

I thought you were meeting Kennedy.  

ELAINE

(Let down) He didn't show.  

GEORGE

Yeah, he did.  

ELAINE

What? He's - He's out there? Oh, my God. I-I gotta go, I gotta go..  

GEORGE

No, no, no. He just left.  

ELAINE

What?  

GEORGE

Yeah, he was talking to Marla.  

JERRY

Marla?  

GEORGE

Yeah, I think, you know, she was, like, crying, and he was consoling her, and then, she, uh, just got into his car, and they just drove away.  

ELAINE

(Angered) He left with Marla, the virgin?  

GEORGE

Yeah.  

ELAINE

They drove away?  

GEORGE

Yeah, drove away.. You know, I said 'Hello' to him. You know, he's - he's-  

JERRY

(Moving to the window, shocked) Oh my God in heaven!  

ELAINE

(Makes a sound of surprise) Is that..?  

GEORGE

Kramer?!  

ELAINE

He's waving..  

MARLA

Ohh, John. That was wonderful..  

ELAINE

Bah bah baaah, Boo doo bah bah bah, boo doo waaaah, waah, waaaah... 

JERRY

Hey, could you do me a favour? [pause] Could you shut-up? 

ELAINE

Hey guess what? This window doesn't work. 

JERRY

I hate rental cars. Nothin' ever works: the window doesn't work, the radio doesn't work... and it smells like a cheap hooker... [pause] Or is that you? 

ELAINE

Gimme ten bucks and find out... 

JERRY

So, this worked out pretty good. Them givin' me an extra ticket, y'know, you get a free trip to St. Louis, I did my gig, you got to see your sister... 

ELAINE

Yeah, worked out good. 

JERRY

And here's the beauty-- 

ELAINE

What? 

JERRY

George is pickin' us up at the airport. 

ELAINE

Get out of here! Why? 

JERRY

You know that awning outside my building? 

ELAINE

Yeah... 

JERRY

He's always bragging about his vertical leap, so I bet him fifty bucks that he couldn't touch the awning. 

ELAINE

So what happened? 

JERRY

He didn't come within two feet of the thing. He's wavin at it... So, I told him if he picks us up at the airport, he wouldn't have to pay me anything. 

ELAINE

Hey, how we doin' on time? 

JERRY

Timed out perfectly. Drop off the car, pick up the rental car shuttle, we walk right on the plane... 

ELAINE

Hey! Wait up! 

JERRY

Hey! Wait up! 

DRIVER

Sorry. Heh heh heh... 

SKYCAP

Where you goin'? 

JERRY

Uh, JFK. [To Elaine] I need some small bills for a tip. You got anything? 

ELAINE

Yeah, you want five? 

JERRY

Gimme ten. 

ELAINE

You're giving him *ten* dollars? 

JERRY

Well, we got three bags. 

ELAINE

That's a pretty big tip... 

JERRY

That's what they get! 

ELAINE

They don't get that much. 

JERRY

Let's ask him. 

ELAINE

We can't ask him... 

JERRY

Let's see what he says. 

ELAINE

Jerry, we don't have time for this... 

JERRY

Two seconds. [To Skycap] Excuse me, my friend and I here, we were having a discussion and we were wondering what you usually get for a tip. 

SKYCAP

Depends on the person, depends on the bag. 

JERRY

Uh, how about a couple of people like us. 

SKYCAP

People like you? I wouldn't expect much, you don't even look like you know what you're doing... 

JERRY

C'mon, seriously... 

SKYCAP

Well, since you asked, usually, I get five dollars a bag. 

ELAINE

What!? 

SKYCAP

That's right. 

ELAINE

*Five* dollars a bag? I don't think so. 

SKYCAP

Look, you asked, I told you. 

ELAINE

You got some nerve trying to take advantage of us... 

JERRY

All right, look, we're late. Thank you very much... 

ELAINE

You're lucky I don't report you... 

SKYCAP

JFK... 

SKYCAP

...Honolulu. 

ELAINE

Wait up! 

JERRY

You see? Never be late for a plane with a girl. 'Cuz a girl runs like a girl-- with the little steps and the arms flailing out... You wanna make this plane, you've gotta run like a man! Get your knees up! 

ELAINE

The flight's been canceled?!?! 

LADY

Everything into JFK's booked... No, wait-- I have two seats into Laguardia-- but they're not together. It's boarding right now. 

JERRY

We'll take 'em! 

ELAINE

We're not going to sit together? 

JERRY

Well, so what? It's not that long-- you'll read. 

ELAINE

Well, what about George? He's supposed to pick us up at Kennedy. 

JERRY

We'll call him... 

ELAINE

There's no time. 

JERRY

No time? [To ticket lady] Is there time? 

LADY

There's no time. 

JERRY

There's no time. All right, we'll call him from the plane. 

LADY

I have one seat in first class, and one in coach. The price is the same since your flight was canceled. 

JERRY

I'll take the first class. 

ELAINE

Jerry! 

JERRY

What? 

ELAINE

Why should you get the first class? 

JERRY

Elaine, have you ever flown first class? 

ELAINE

No. 

JERRY

All right then. See? You won't know what you're missing. I've flown first class, Elaine-- I can't go back to coach. I can't... I won't... 

ELAINE

You flew here coach. 

JERRY

Yeah, that's a point... 

ELAINE

All right, fine. I don't care. If the plane crashes, everybody in first class is going to die, anyway. 

JERRY

Yeah, I'm sure you'll live. 

JERRY

Bon voyage, Lainey! 

ELAINE

Great... [To herself] Help me... 

TIA

Excuse me, I think you're in my seat... 

JERRY

Oh, sorry... My mistake... [To himself] Thank... *you*! 

GEORGE

Hey, thanks for coming with me. 

KRAMER

Hey, what made you think you could touch that awning? 

GEORGE

I confused it with another awning. 

KRAMER

So how we doin' on time? 

GEORGE

We're perfect. I timed this out so we would pull up at the terminal *exactly* 17 minutes after their flight is supposed to land. That gives them just enough time to get off the plane, pick up their bags and be walking *out* of the terminal as we roll up. I tell you, it's a thing of beauty. I can not express to you the feeling I get from a perfect airport pickup. (starts looking around) What's going on? What are you doing? The Long Island Expressway? What are you getting on the Long Island Expressway for? Do you know what the traffic will be like? This is a suicide mission! 

KRAMER

Will you relax?! 

GEORGE

Oh, I had it perfectly timed out: the Grand Central, the Van Wyck! You destroyed my whole timing! 

KRAMER

This is the best way to go! 

GEORGE

Do you know what happens if I miss him? I don't get credit for the pickup and I lose my 50 bucks... 

KRAMER

George, there's no traffic at this time. Now, come on, man... 

GEORGE

Really? 

KRAMER

If anything, we'll probably get there early. I'll have a chance to go to the Duty Free shop. 

GEORGE

The Duty Free Shop? Duty Free is the biggest sucker deal in retail. Do you know how much duty is? 

KRAMER

Duty. 

GEORGE

Yeah, 'duty'. Do you know how much duty is? 

KRAMER

No, I dunno how much duty is. 

GEORGE

Duty is *nothing*. It's like sales tax... 

KRAMER

I still like to stop at the duty free shop. 

GEORGE

I like to stop at the duty free shop. 

KRAMER

I like to stop at the duty free shop! 

TIA

So, he says, ``squeeze your breasts together'', and I say, ``I thought this was an ad for shoes''... 

JERRY

Oh my... 

TIA

Is that the new Esquire? Turn to page 146. 

JERRY

Wow! Coming out of the shower... It's a good thing they gave you that washcloth to cover yourself up... What is this an ad for? 

TIA

See those wrinkled jeans slung over the chair? Way in the background, out of focus? 

JERRY

Uh-huh... 

KRAMER

How does it look on your side? [Pause while George just stares at him] We'll get there... 

ELAINE

Oh, look at this... He's sleeping and I have to go to the bathroom. Maybe he'll wake up soon. What if my kidneys burst? Is it worth it not to wake this man up to damage a major organ? I hope this disgusting slob appreciates what I'm doing for him... [To passenger on the other side of her, but still to herself] Yeah, make a little more noise with your gum-- that's helpful. 

GEORGE

They're not here! You cost me fifty bucks! 

KRAMER

Look at you! You run like a girl! Run like a man! Lift your knees! 

GEORGE

Look, we're wasting our time here! We're a half-hour late, they've probably took it off the board already. 

KRAMER

No, there it is, right there-- 133... and it's canceled. 

GEORGE

Canceled? Do I still get credit for the pick up? I was here! 

KRAMER

Ok, c'mon... let's go check over at the ticket counter. 

GROSSBARD

Oh, there it is honey, gate 18A, 8:30... [He leaves] 

KRAMER

Did you see that guy? 

GEORGE

No... What guy? 

KRAMER

That guy.. He was just... 

GEORGE

Listen, you go over to the ticket counter, I'm going to go stop in the gift shop and pick up a copy of Time magazine. There's supposed to ba blurb about Jerry in it and I think he mentioned my name! 

KRAMER

[still lost] I know that guy... 

PRISONER

Gotta get my Time magazine... Never miss my Time magazine. 

GUARD

Yeah, get your magazine and let's get out of here. 

PRISONER

Hey, I was gonna take that! 

GEORGE

Gee, I'm sorry... I got here first. 

PRISONER

I don't care when you got here, I want the magazine... 

GEORGE

You don't understand, there's a *blurb* about me in this magazine! 

PRISONER

A *blurb*?!? *You're* a blurb! Check out the cover, idiot! 

GUARD

All right, let's go... 

PRISONER

I want the magazine! 

GEORGE

Umm... No. 

PRISONER

You know what I would do to you, if I wasn't in these shackles... 

GEORGE

But you are Blanche... You *are* in the shackles. Oh, I can't wait to read my *Time* magazine! Laaaast copy, too. Maybe I'll read it tomorrow-- in the park! It's supposed to be a beeyootiful day! Have a nice life... sentence, that is! 

KRAMER

They're on a different flight. They're scheduled to land in a half hour, only at Laguardia. 

GEORGE

Laguardia? All right, let's go. C'mon... 

KRAMER

Where do I know that guy from? 

ELAINE

[To herself, loudly] Wake up, you human slug! Wake up! *Wake* *up*!! I can't hold it anymore! [To the slug out loud] Excuse me, I've gotta go to the bathroom... 

JERRY

Oh my... that *is* refreshing... 

ATTENDANT

Would you care for some slippers? 

JERRY

Sounds lovely! [To Tia, motioning to put them on her] May I? 

TIA

Please! 

JERRY

Why, It's a perfect fit. You must be Cinderella. 

GEORGE

My name is not mentioned in this blurb... 

KRAMER

It's Grossbard! 

GEORGE

Who's Grossbard? 

KRAMER

When I lived on Third avenue and 18th street 20 years ago, I had this roommate who was *always* behind in his rent. Then one month, he asks me to loan him his share of the rent-- 240 bucks! He took the cash and >pfffft< disappears. Well, I try to find him, I went to his girlfriend's house, even his family. Uh-uh. I never got the money back! He screwed me! And that's the guy-- John Grossbard! 

GEORGE

Hey Kramer, c'mon-- it was 240 bucks twenty years ago... 

KRAMER

No, I'm gonna turn around... I'm gonna get that guy... 

GEORGE

No-no-no, Kramer. Kramer! Kramer! You *cannot* abandon people in the middle of an airport pickup! It's a binding social contract. We... we must go forward... not back. 

JERRY

Tia, did you see all the flowers in that bathroom? It's like an English garden in there. 

ATTENDANT

They're gardenias, mostly. 

JERRY

I thought I smelled lilac. 

ATTENDANT

Yes, there are a few of those, too... 

TIA

It's almost overwhelming... 

CAPTAIN

Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. Due to equipment problems at the runway at Laguardia, we've been instructed by the tower to re-route and land at JFK. We apologize for any inconvenience... 

ELAINE

[To anyone who'll listen] What'd he say? What'd he say? 

GEORGE

Well, You're not gonna believe it... 

KRAMER

What? 

GEORGE

The plane's been re-routed *back* to Kennedy. We've got 45 minutes. 

KRAMER

Let's go. Listen to the bell, Grossbard-- it tolls for thee. 

ATTENDANT

We have some *delicious* Chateau Briande, my personal favourite. Or, if you prefer something lighter, a poached Dover sole in a delicate white wine sauce with just a *hint* of saffron. 

JERRY

Oh, saffron! That sounds good. 

ATTENDANT

And today we're featuring wines from the *Tuscany* region... 

TIA

Tuscany! 

ELAINE

Hi. Can I get to my seat? 

ATTENDANT

You're just gonna have to wait... 

ELAINE

But you just passed it. I'm sitting right there next to that guy... 

ATTENDANT

You're not supposed to get up during the food service. 

ELAINE

Well, nobody *told* me that! 

ATTENDANT

Look. This plane is *full*. I got a lot of people to serve. Now please... You're just gonna have to wait. 

GEORGE

There it is. Gate 46... We got plenty of time. 

KRAMER

Grossbard's plane leaves in ten minutes. I *still* got time to catch him! 

GEORGE

How you gonna catch him? He's probably boarded the plane already. 

KRAMER

Gimme your credit card. 

GEORGE

My credit card? 

KRAMER

Just gimme the card, don't ask me any questions. 

GEORGE

I'm not gonna give you my card unless you tell me what it's for! 

KRAMER

I'm gonna buy a ticket-- I'm gonna get on that flight. 

GEORGE

What, are you, nuts? You're gonna spend more on the ticket than you're gonna get back from Grossbard. 

KRAMER

No, I'm not gonna use the ticket! I'm gonna get my money, I'll get off the plane and turn your ticket in for a refund. It's not gonna cost you a dime! Now gimme the card. 

GEORGE

This is a *great* idea! Here... use this one. I get frequent flyer miles with every purchase... Wait! Get two tickets. As long as your turning it in for a refund what's the difference? I'll get *double* the bonus miles. 

ELAINE

Excuse me. I'm sorry to make you do this, but I got stuck in the aisle and the flight attendant wouldn't let me get through. There's no way to get around that cart... 

ELAINE

I'll try and remember that. [Pause] Where's my meal? 

ELAINE

Excuse me? Excuse me, but I didn't get a meal. 

ATTENDANT

Are you sure? 

ELAINE

Yes, I'm sure! I would know if a tray of food had been served to me. 

ATTENDANT

Would you? Well, the only meal left is a kosher meal. 

ELAINE

Kosher meal? I don't want a kosher meal. I don't even know what a kosher meal is. 

ELAINE

Then why didn't you take it? 

ELAINE

You're eating my food! 

ATTENDANT

Look, I got earplugs to collect. Do you want it, or not. 

TIA

Mmmmmmmm! 

TIA

This is the best sundae I've ever had. 

JERRY

Oh, man. You know what... they got the fudge on the bottom-- y'see? That enables you to control your fudge distribution as you're eatin' your ice cream. 

TIA

I've never met a man who knew so much about nothing. 

JERRY

Thank you... 

TIA

Mmmmmm! 

ATTENDANT

More anything? 

JERRY

More everything! 

KRAMER

Look, I got Super Savers! C'mon. 

GEORGE

Super Savers? Are they refundable!? 

GEORGE

You bought non-refundable tickets, you idiot! 

KRAMER

She talked me in to it-- she said it was the best deal. 

GEORGE

Do you know how much this is going to cost me? 

KRAMER

Look, I'll tell you what-- I'll split it with you 

GEORGE

Look, I'm gonna go to the bathroom... 

ATTENDANT

Excuse me... Excuuuse me... 

ELAINE

What? Oh, no... nothing for me thanks. 

ATTENDANT

What is your name? 

ELAINE

Elaine Benes? 

ATTENDANT

[Checks her list] You're going to have to go back to coach. 

ELAINE

No, but there was nobody sitting here... 

ATTENDANT

Yes, but you're still not allowed. These seats are very expensive. 

ELAINE

Oh, no, please, don't send me back there. Please, I'll do anything. It's so nice up here. It's so comfortable up here. I don't want to go back there. Please don't send me back there... [She notices another attendant offering goods] Oh, you got *cookies*! 

ATTENDANT

You're going to have to go back to your seat! 

ELAINE

Ok, fine. I'll go back... You know, our goal should be a society *without* *classes*! [She goes through the curtain to, ick, *coach*] Do you realise that the people up here are getting *cookies*! 

JERRY

What is all the racket back there? You know, you're trying to relax on the plane and this is what you have to put up with. [To attendant] What is going on? 

ATTENDANT

Sir, this woman tried to *sneak* into first class. 

JERRY

Oh, you see, that's terrible. The problem is, that curtain is no security-- there really should be a locking door. 

KRAMER

Hey! That guy owes me 240 bucks! 

JERRY

Couldn't be... 

JERRY

Where are they already? I don't see them anywhere... I got my bags, I'm ready to go. 

ELAINE

Yeah, *you* got *your* bags... 

ELAINE

The worst flight I have been on in my entire life. 

JERRY

Yeah, me too... 

TIA

I'll call you. 

JERRY

Okay... [To a bamboozled Elaine] It's a business thing... 

KRAMER

You guys ready? 

JERRY

Yeah. Where's George? 

GEORGE

(can't be heard but looks like) Kramer! 

GEORGE

I loved her Jerry, I loved her. 

JERRY

No, you didn't. 

GEORGE

And she loved me. Hoo, ho, she really did. 

JERRY

No she didn't. 

GEORGE

What am I going to do now? I can't live without Susan. I gotta get her back. How? How, am I gonna get her back? 

ELAINE

[OC] Not only didn't you love her, you didn't even like her. 

GEORGE

Who says? 

ELAINE

You did. 

GEORGE

Ah, ...A beautiful successful intelligent woman's in love with me and I throw it all away. uh oh boy. Now I'll spend the rest of my life living alone. I'll sit in my disgusting little apartment watching basketball games, eating Chinese take out. Walking around with no underwear. Because I'm too lazy to do a laundry. 

JERRY

You walk around with no underwear? 

GEORGE

Yeah, what do you do when you run out of laundry? 

JERRY

I do a wash. 

GEORGE

Who am I going to meet who is better than her? No one, Jerry. No one's better than her. 

JERRY

When you were with her you said you couldn't stand her. 

GEORGE

I loved her! 

JERRY

You said goin up the steps of her apartment was like being taken to a cell. 

GEORGE

I would give anything to be going up those stairs again. 

GEORGE

I gotta call her. Should I call her? 

JERRY

George, I don't know if that is such a good idea? 

GEORGE

Whyie? 

JERRY

You need some professional advice. Why don't you go see Elaine's friend? She's a therapist. 

GEORGE

I'm not going to see that nut doctor she went to Europe with. 

JERRY

No, no no [Elaine enters, flossing teeth] Elaine what's the name of that friend of yours ... that's a therapist ... the woman. 

ELAINE

Dana Folley. 

JERRY

Right, Dana Folley. 

GEORGE

She any good? 

ELAINE

Yeah, she's terrific. Why? You thinking of going? 

GEORGE

Wa, uh, ... 

ELAINE

Tia? Who's that? 

JERRY

She's the model I met on the plane. 

ELAINE

She sent you a Christmas card? 

JERRY

Um uh. And we're going out Saturday night. 

GEORGE

My Darling Susan! My DARLING!!! 

JERRY

What are you doing? 

ELAINE

... date with Fred. 

JERRY

The religious guy? 

ELAINE

He's not THAT religious. 

JERRY

Let us pray. 

KRAMER

Hey, you got any Double Crunch? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

JERRY

Kramer, should I call Susan? 

KRAMER

Now what does the little man inside you say? See you gotta listen to the little man. 

GEORGE

My little man doesn't know. 

KRAMER

The little man knows all. 

GEORGE

My little man's an idiot. 

ELAINE

See, she was clever. You know she put her picture on a card. I should do that. I never do anything like that. 

KRAMER

You want a picture like that on a Christmas card? I can do that for you. ... 

GEORGE

She kept such a nice clean apartment. She was so sanitary. 

ELAINE

No, no, I was just thinking out loud I don't want my picture on a card. 

KRAMER

No, no, I'll take your picture. I'll take care of everything. 

GEORGE

She made a big breakfast every Sunday. I don't know what she put in those eggs. 

KRAMER

All right, ... now, you come on over. I'll have my cereal and I'll take your picture. 

ELAINE

Really? Can you really take a picture? 

JERRY

Yeah, he's good. He takes good pictures. He's got equipment over there. 

ELAINE

All right, ha ha 

KRAMER

I don't know about that outfit though. 

ELAINE

Why? What's wrong with it? 

KRAMER

Well, we'll have to improvise. 

GEORGE

(singing) Oh hey, if you happen to see the most beautiful girl who walked out on me. Tell her I'm sorry. Tell her I need my baby ... oh won't you tell her ... I love her. Oh hey, ... 

JERRY

George I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave. 

JERRY

So, I'm thinking of putting in na tropical fish tank right here. 

TIA

Are you sure you're ready for that kind of comitment? 

JERRY

Well, I figure if it doesn't work out I can always flush them down the toilet. 

TIA

That's horrible! 

JERRY

What's that perfume you're wearing? 

TIA

oh I completely forgot I want you to see this. The CALVIN KLEIN ad I was telling you about came out today. 

JERRY

What is that smell? 

TIA

It's here somewhere. 

JERRY

It smells like the beach. 

TIA

Exactly. 

JERRY

Oh my God is that the new perfume? 

TIA

Yeah. 

JERRY

I can't believe this. My next door neighbour had the idea for this exact perfume last year. He even met with an executive at CALVIN KLEIN. I can't believe they stole his idea. 

TIA

Are you sure? 

JERRY

And you're the model for this perfume? 

JERRY

Uh, that's him. He just came home. ... Uh, the door [Jerry pushes his door against Kramer's entrance] 

KRAMER

Hey 

JERRY

Hey. 

KRAMER

Hey, how ya' doing? [Trying to enter] 

JERRY

Yeah, uh, I'll see you later. 

KRAMER

I just wanted to borrow your Dust Buster. 

JERRY

All right come on in. ... Just wait over HERE! Just wait here and I'll get it for you. ... Kramer this is Tia. 

KRAMER

Hello. 

KRAMER

How tall are you? 

TIA

Five ten. 

KRAMER

Come on lets see - Back to Back. 

JERRY

NO! Kramer! 

KRAMER

What's the matter with you? I just wanted to see how tall she was. 

JERRY

Oh, you're tall - she's tall I'm tall. What's the difference who's tall. We're all tall. 

KRAMER

What's that? 

JERRY

What? 

KRAMER

That smell. What's that smell? 

JERRY

(starting the Dust Buster) What smell? 

KRAMER

It's very familiar. I can't put my finger on it. It's very familiar. 

JERRY

Oh, they're all the same. Here. [gives him Dust Buster] Now if you'll excuse us, .. 

KRAMER

Yeah, okay, So I'll see you tomorrow uh? 

JERRY

Okay. 

KRAMER

Yeah. Nice meeting you. 

TIA

Nice meeting you too. 

JERRY

I'll see you later. 

JERRY

Ooow, that was close. 

KRAMER

[OC] THE BEACH!!! 

KRAMER

You smell like the beach. What's the name of that perfume? you're wearing. 

TIA

It's Ocean by CALVIN KLEIN. 

KRAMER

CALVIN KLEIN? No, no. That's my idea. They, they stole my idea. Y' see I had the idea of a cologne that makes you smell like you just came from the beach. 

JERRY

I know look at this [shows ad] 

KRAMER

Whooo, ... That's you! What is going on here? The gyp(?) he laughs at me then he steals my idea. I could have been a millionaire. I could have been a fragrance millionaire, Jerry. ... They're not going to get away with this. 

DANA

Hello. George, come in. Come in I've heard an awful lot about you. Please sit down. 

GEORGE

Well hello. Um, ah, specifically the reason that I'm here, uh, I don't know uh what Elaine told you but uh I broke up with my girlfriend a couple of weeks ago. Actually she broke up with me [struggling with his coat zipper] and uh, well, I was the cause of it and uh, I just wanted to find out from you ... What's with this thing? 

DANA

So uh, she broke up with you? ... 

GEORGE

Yeah, and, ... Why won't this go down? 

DANA

It's all right don't worry about it. So, why did she break up with you? 

GEORGE

What is with this damn zipper? 

DANA

It doesn't matter. You'll fix it later. Tell me about your girlfriend. 

GEORGE

It's stuck on a piece of cloth here. I can't get the cloth out. 

DANA

It doesn't matter, so ... 

GEORGE

This is a brand new jacket. Boy this really burns me up, ... 

DANA

George, George, look at me. Okay, forget about the zipper. ... What's your girlfriend's name? 

GEORGE

... Susan. 

DANA

Okay, we're getting somewhere. 

GEORGE

UH, ha ha, ... It's just SO frustrating. It's a brand new jacket. 

ELAINE

Anyway so Fred and I are going to do some volunteer work for that Church on Amsterdam. 

JERRY

Oh, volunteer work!. See that's what I like about the holiday season. That's the true spirit of Christmas. People being helped by people other than me. That makes me feel good inside. Look at what we have here. (mail). A Christmas card from Laine. You didn't have to go to all that trouble. 

ELAINE

It was no trouble. My assistant did the whole thing. 

JERRY

I didn't even see the picture. How did it come out? 

ELAINE

Well, you know. It's a picture? 

JERRY

Oh yeah. Look at that. Looks good. Kramer did a good job. 

ELAINE

Yeah, well. How hard is it to take a picture? 

JERRY

... um ... 

ELAINE

What? 

JERRY

Did you look at look at this picture carefully? 

ELAINE

Carefully? 

JERRY

Because I'm not sure and and and correct me if I'm wrong but I think I see ... a nipple. 

ELAINE

What? 

JERRY

Here. Take a look. What, what is that? 

ELAINE

(gasps) Oh my God! That's my nipple. 

JERRY

That's what I thought. 

ELAINE

That's my nipple. My nipple's exposed. I sent this card to hundreds of people! My parents. My boss. Uh, Nana and Papa. 

JERRY

DIDN'T YOU LOOK AT THE PICTURE? 

ELAINE

Oh God I didn't notice. Oh, what am I going to do? You know your whole life you go through painstaking efforts to hide your nipple and then BOOM, suddenly hundreds of people get their own personal shot of it. 

KRAMER

Hey! 

ELAINE

Have you seen the card? 

KRAMER

What card? 

ELAINE

This car. 

KRAMER

Yeah, yeah. Of course. I took it. 

ELAINE

Well did you notice anything unusual about it? 

KRAMER

No. 

ELAINE

Well come here and take a look. 

KRAMER

Yeah, so? 

ELAINE

So, what's that? 

KRAMER

That's a nipple. 

ELAINE

Right!! 

KRAMER

Ooo! 

ELAINE

Aw, great!? Didn't you see that? 

KRAMER

Aw, no, no I didn't notice it. no, uh, 

ELAINE

It's because you made me wear that stupid shirt. 

JERRY

Well, maybe no one noticed it. You didn't notice it. Let me go get Newman. We'll see if he sees it. 

ELAINE

No. I don't want him looking. 

JERRY

Oh what's the difference. Everybody else you know has it. 

ELAINE

Oh my God. I sent one to the super in my building. My mailman. My ten year old little nephew. Sister Mary Catherine. Father Chelios. Oh my God Fred! I sent one to Fred. 

NEWMAN

Okay. What is it? 

JERRY

Take a look at this card. Tell me if you notice anything unusual about it. 

NEWMAN

Your nipple's showing. 

JERRY

Okay. Thanks. 

NEWMAN

Anything else? 

JERRY

No. 

NEWMAN

All right. See you later. 

JERRY

What? So what? It's a nipple. A little round circular protuberance. What's the big deal? See everybody's got them. See I got them. 

KRAMER

I got them too. 

JERRY

Everybody's got them. 

DANA

You see it's kind of got a little piece of cloth that's slipped underneath and it's ... 

GEORGE

Pull it up a little bit. 

DANA

Uhg. Well you hold it. Wait, uh, Damn It! I can't move it. God, I've never seen a zipper so stubborn. DAMN IT! I almost had it. 

GEORGE

Yeah, okey, wait wait. That will separate. 

DANA

No. Let me try... 

GEORGE

Take it right off the chest... 

DANA

Ugh, .. 

GEORGE

You're gonna rip it. You're gonna rip it. 

DANA

YEAH!! UGH!!! ARG!!! ... I am afraid we're going to have to stop. 

GEORGE

Okay. Uh, my mother is is going to pay for the sessions. ... Oh,Elaine? 

DANA

Yeah. 

GEORGE

(stares at card) 

JERRY

No, No, No, No, Oh, No. 

JERRY

Well every day for the past four days she hasn't returned one call. 

GEORGE

Was it a scratch or a pick? 

JERRY

It was a scratch. 

GEORGE

Hey. It's me. 

JERRY

Don't you think I know the difference between a pick and a scratch? 

JERRY

Yeah? 

ELAINE

(OC) It's me. 

JERRY

Come on up. 

GEORGE

Was there any nostril penetration? 

JERRY

There may have been some incidental penetration. But from her angle she was in no position to make the call. 

GEORGE

So let's say in her mind she witnessed a pick. Okay, so then what? 

JERRY

Is that so unforgivable? Is that like breaking a commandment? Did God say to Moses thou shalt not pick? 

GEORGE

I guarantee you that Moses was a picker. You wander throughh the desert for forty years with that dry air. ... You telling me you're not going to have occasion to clean house a little bit. 

JERRY

Let me ask you something. If you were going out with somebody and if she did that what would, would you do? Would you continue going out with her? 

GEORGE

No. That's disgusting! 

ELAINE

You cannot believe what I'm going through. That card is plastered all over the office. Everybody is calling me, Nip! ... Yeah. That's my new nickname at the office. Nip! These guys keep asking me out for drinks. Not only that, Fred, you know the guy I told you about? He hasn't called me in three days. ... [sees card] Oh please! 

GEORGE

Hey. How come I didn't get a Christmas card? Everybody else got one. Jerry got one, Kramer got one. I thought we were good friends. I don't get a Christmas card. I don't get it. 

ELAINE

You want a Christmas card? You want a Christmas card? All right here. [rubs George's head on her breasts] Here's your Christmas card. 

KRAMER

Got any Double Crunch? 

JERRY

yeah. I think I do. 

KRAMER

What's that perfume? 

ELAINE

What, Ocean. 

KRAMER

That's mine. That's my smell. Jerry you've got to get that model to get me an appointment with CALVIN KLEIN. 

JERRY

I can't She won't return my calls because she caught me in a pick at a light. 

KRAMER

I thought you said it was a scratch. 

JERRY

But that's not what she thinks. 

GEORGE

Why don't you call her agency. Maybe she's been out of town and she didn't get the calls. 

JERRY

All right. I'll call the agency. [Elaine grabs card from George] Hello. Yes, I'm trying to get in touch with Tia Van Camp. Do you know if she's been in town? She's been in town. Oh really. well thank you very much. [hangs up] She has been in town. She's at CALVIN KLEIN's right now. 

KRAMER

Let's go. 

GEORGE

It'll be different this time. 

SUSAN

I need someone a little more stable. 

GEORGE

I'm not stable? I'm like a rock. I take these glasses off, you can't tell the difference between me and a rock. I put these glasses on a rock. You know what jumps into most people's minds? Costanza! 

SUSAN

People don't change. 

GEORGE

I change I change. Two weeks ago I tried a soft boiled egg. Never liked it before. Now I'm dunkin a piece of toast in there and I'm loving it. 

SUSAN

I'm not a soft boiled egg. 

GEORGE

And I am not a piece of toast. 

SUSAN

I just don't think we have anything in common. 

GEORGE

That's okay. That's good. You think Louie Pasteur and his wife had anything in common? He was in the fields all day with the cows, you know with the milk, examining the milk, delving into milk, consummed with milk. Pasteurization, Homogenization, She was in the kitchen killing cockroaches with a boot on each hand. 

SUSAN

Why were there so many cockroaches? 

GEORGE

Because. There was a lot of cake lying around the house. Just sitting there going with all the excess milk from all the experiments [grins] 

SUSAN

And they got along? 

GEORGE

Yes! Yes. You know. She didn't know about Pasteurization. He didn't know anout Fumigation. But they made it work! 

KRAMER

I want to talk to Calvin. 

SECRETARY

You can't go in there. 

KRAMER

Let me talk to Calvin. 

TIA

Kramer? 

KRAMER

Yeah, uh. 

KLEIN

Who are you? 

KRAMER

I'm here to talk about the ocean. 

KLEIN

Oh, yes kramer. I uh, think I know something about this. Will you excuse us Tia? [Tia leaves] 

KRAMER

Now I don't want any trouble Calvin. 

KLEIN

Neither do I. 

JERRY

Hello there you are. 

TIA

What are you doing here? 

JERRY

Well, I had to talk to you - I noticed you haven't been returning my calls. 

TIA

Well, I've been busy. 

JERRY

Because I - I thought we had a good time the other night, an' the only explanation I can come up with is that you think that you caught me (flustered, he indicates a nose pick) 

TIA

(Waving him off) I'd rather not talk about this.. 

JERRY

But I was clearly on the outer edge of the nostril. 

TIA

I know what I saw. (Turns toward the elevators) 

JERRY

But there - but there was no pick! I - I did not pick! There ws no piick! 

TIA

I gotta go. (Quickly walks away from Jerry) 

JERRY

No! No pick! 

KRAMER

All right, now here's the scoop, Jockey. I, uh, I came in here last January to talk to one of your ffflunkies.. 

KLEIN

(Reflecting on Kramer) Interesting face.. 

KRAMER

Yeah.. And, um, when I told him my idea about the beach cologne, you know, he - he laughed at me. 

KLEIN

You're very lithe, aren't you? Very graceful. 

KRAMER

Well, yeah. 

KLEIN

Sit down, eh? (Kramer, misjudging one side of the couch, sits down uncomfortably) You're very lean, but muscular.. 

KRAMER

You know, I try to take care of myself. I - I watch what I eat. Ah, just recently I cut out fructose. 

KLEIN

You're spectacular. 

KRAMER

(Flattered) Oh? 

ELAINE

I told you, Fred - my friend's next door neighbor took it. 

FRED

(Incredulous) Soo - what happened?! 

ELAINE

Well, I-I-I must a missed a button. I forgot to button it. 

FRED

I really don't see how you could miss a button like that. 

ELAINE

Oh, you've never missed a button?! (Phone rings, she puts it on speakerphone) Yeah?.. 

RECEPTIONIST

Your sister, Gail. 

ELAINE

Oh, God - my nephew. (Picks up the phone and hits the button) Hi, Gail!.. Yu.. yu... Yes, Gail, I know how old he is. 

WORKER

(Pokes his head into the doorway) Hey, Nip, ya need that manuscript or can I take it home? 

ELAINE

Yeah, take it! Take it!.. An' stop calling me 'Nip'! (Co-worker takes it and quickly leaves. Elaine goes back to the phone) It was an accident! Well.. well.. it's gotta be somewhere. Look under his mattress. 

WOMAN

About the focus group? I had nothing to do with the focus group. What's your point? (She sees Kramer emerge from another room. He's wearing only dress shoes, socks, and his briefs) My.. he's sexual, athletic.. an' without a trace of self-consciousness! 

KLEIN

His buttocks are sublime! 

MAN

Of course, his pectorals could use a little work - I suppose we could get him into the weight room. 

WOMAN

(Mesmerized with Kramer's body) No, let's get him in the studio today. We can send these out immediately. 

MAN

You've done it again, C.K.! 

JERRY

An' what if I did do it? Even though I admit to nothing, and never will. What does that make me? And I'm not here just defending myself but all those Pickers out there who've been caught. (Elevator doors open) Each an' every one of them, who has to suffer the shame and humiliation because of people like you.. (Everyone but Jerry is now in the elevator. Jerry's still addressing them) Are we not human?! If we pick, do we not bleed?! (Elevator doors shut. A few people in the hallway are looking at him, he turns and addresses them) I am not an animal! 

ELAINE

I did not bare myself deliberately, but I tell you, I wish now that I had! (Fred, shocked by her speech, flees. She calls after him, still standing at the hallway) Because it is not me that has been exposed, but you! For I have seen the nipple on your soul! 

GX

So the minute I started up the steps to her apartment I knew I made a terrible mistake. Going back with her. So we're in her apartment she goes into the bathroom. I'm cursing myself; now how do I get out of this? Then it hits me like a bolt of lightening. The pick. 

JERRY

The pick? 

ELAINE

The pick? 

GEORGE

She comes out of the bathroom, I'm in up to my wrist. You should have seen the look on her face. 

JERRY

I think I've seen that look. 

KRAMER

I've got the magazine. The underwear ad came out. 

JERRY

Boy, they really worked on your pectorals. 

GEORGE

Your buttocks are spectacular. 

ELAINE

Oh my! 

KRAMER

What? 

ELAINE

I'm not sure but... I think I see your... 

JERRY

You don't understand. I got this all timed out. I got another spot across town at 9:50, I'm not gonna be able to make it! 

KERNIS

I hear you, guy. 

JERRY

And I'm doin' Letterman Monday. You know, I gotta work out the material! 

KERNIS

Why don't you come back and do the 11 o'clock spot? 

JERRY

No, I'm supposed to meet my friends to see this movie ``CheckMate'' at 10:30. 

BUCKLES

Hey, Jer! 

JERRY

[not losing a step] Heeeeyyyyyyyy..... [and out the door] 

GEORGE

Excuse me, do you have a ticket? 

MAN

No. 

GEORGE

Okay. Good. 

BUCKLES

Jerry! 

JERRY

What are <you> doing here? 

BUCKLES

Hey, do you think this is funny? ``Why do they call it athlete's foot? You don't have to be an athlete to get it. I mean, my father gets it all the time, and believe me, he's no athlete!'' 

ELAINE

I've been *dying* to see ``CheckMate''. 

GEORGE

Well, if it's as good as ``Ponce de Leon'', I'll be happy. 

ELAINE

``Ponce de Leon'', are you kidding me? I hated that movie! 

GEORGE

``Ponce de Leon''? But that was great! 

ELAINE

Oh, <come on>. That Fountain of Youth scene at the end, where they're all splashin' around, and then they go running over to the mirror to see if it really worked? I mean, come on! [laughing too hard to continue] That's stupid! 

GEORGE

Lemme tell you sum'in. When Ponce looked in that mirror and saw that he hadn't changed, and that tear started to roll down his cheek? ... I lost it. 

KRAMER

Listen, I'm gonna get a hot dog at Payapa King. 

ELAINE

No, wait! 

GEORGE

You're not going to get back here in time! 

KRAMER

I'm starvin', I haven't had any dinner! 

ELAINE

You can get a hot dog in the theater. 

KRAMER

I don't wanna get a movie hot dog! [in tears] I want a Papaya King hot dog! 

ELAINE

Kramer, Jerry is going to be here any second, and then this line is going to start moving, and we're going to end up in the front row. 

KRAMER

Well, just save me a seat. 

ELAINE

No! I don't want to save seats. Don't put me through that! I once had the fleece just ripped out of my winter coat in a seat-saving incident! 

GEORGE

I'm in line to buy. 

ELAINE

No, George, this is the ticket-<holders> line. 

GEORGE

No it's not, it's the ticket-<buyers> line. 

ELAINE

Then how come we're not moving? 

KRAMER

Good question. 

GEORGE

Is this the ticket holders line, or the buyers? 

MAN

Holders. 

GEORGE

But I asked you before if you had a ticket, and you said no! 

MAN

I didn't. My friend was getting it. 

GEORGE

[furious] Good. It's good to be accurate like that. 

ELAINE

Can you believe him? 

KRAMER

He's spaced out. 

ELAINE

How long would *you* have stood in the ticket-holders line? 

KRAMER

[thinks for a while] 

ELAINE

[gives up] Yeah, exactly... 

ELAINE

I don't wanna go to a... miniplex multi-theater! 

GEORGE

It's the same movie! What's the difference? 

ELAINE

It's not a theater, it's like a room where they bring in POWs to show them propaganda films. 

JERRY

[to taxi driver] Take the Park! 

BUCKLES

No no no, take 55th. 

BUCKLES

Jerry, I want you to do me a favor. No more fish! 

JERRY

[rubbing his eyes hoping the nightmare will end] Okay, I get your point! 

BUCKLES

I had a point? 

GEORGE

Hey, you know what else is playing here? ``Rochelle Rochelle''. 

ELAINE

Sigh/Ugh. 

GEORGE

I wouldn't mind seein' <that>. 

ELAINE

Yeah. You know, men can sit through the most boring movie if there's even the slightest possibility that a woman will take her top off. 

GEORGE

So what's your point? 

GEORGE

By the way, you owe me seven fifty. 

ELAINE

Oh, all right. Can you break a twenty? 

GEORGE

No, I don't have any change. 

ELAINE

Oh, well, then I'll pay you later. 

GEORGE

Or, I could take the twenty, then I could pay *you* later. 

ELAINE

Yeah, you *could*... 

GEORGE

Might be easier. 

ELAINE

I mean, how is that easier? I mean, then you would owe me twelve fifty instead of me owing you seven fifty. 

GEORGE

[trying to act as if he doesn't care one way or the other, but we know better] Either way. 

ELAINE

Yeah. 

GEORGE

So... Can I have it? 

ELAINE

I tell you what, I'll get the popcorn and the soda. 

GEORGE

Whaddya mean, you'll ``get'' the popcorn and the soda? 

ELAINE

I will buy your popcorn and soda. We'll call it even. 

GEORGE

I tell you what, you give me the twenty, and I will buy *you* a popcorn and soda, and I'll throw in a bon-bons. 

ELAINE

[exasperated] George, you're sappin' my strength. 

GEORGE

You go in and save seats. 

ELAINE

[in a panic] Me!? But that's three seats! I can't save three seats! I told you about that guy who tore up my winter coat! 

BUCKLES

Jerry, I want you to have this piece of material. 

JERRY

That's very nice of you, but I can't do the voices. 

BUCKLES

Jerry! Don't start up with me! 

JERRY

I gotta get out of this cab... 

BUCKLES

But Jerry, quit riffing! 

JERRY

No, I'm not riffing. I'm ignoring! Do you understand the difference? 

BUCKLES

[pause] Can you help me get on The Tonight Show? 

ELAINE

No, these are saved. 

MAN

All of them? C'mon, you can't take *four* seats. 

ELAINE

What, is that a rule? 

GEORGE

Well, why don't *you* go, and I could save the seats. You said you didn't like saving anyway. 

ELAINE

[stopping someone from sitting in the seat next to her] No, *TAKEN*, Taken, taken. [to George] [shrugs] I'm getting the hang of it. 

GEORGE

Why don't you give me the twenty, and I'll stop and get change, and then you and I can... uh... you-know, settle. 

ELAINE

Can we do this later, George? 

GEORGE

Psh. What's the point of even discussing it? [condescendingly takes her hand and pats it] You'll give me the money when you have it. [takes two steps, then reconsiders, then re-reconsiders] I, I trust you. 

KRAMER

Could you do me a favor? If you see a guy that's five foot eleven, he's got uh a big head and flared nostrils, tell him his friend's going to be right back, okay? 

ELAINE

No, I'm sorry, these are taken. ... They're in the lobby buying popcorn. ... What are you doing? These are taken, these are taken! 

WOMAN

Which one? 

ELAINE

These two and this one. ... No! Don't come over here! These are taken. Go! Go! These are taken! They're taken! THEY'RE TAKEN!!! 

ELAINE

Oh, take 'em. 

GEORGE

Um, excuse me, have you see a guy with like a horse face, big teeth, and a, and a pointed nose? 

CLERK

... flared nostrils? 

GEORGE

Yeah. 

CLERK

Nope, haven't seen him. 

BUCKLES

Jerry, could you do me a personal favor? And if I'm out of line, *please*, let me know. Could I keep my trench coat in your closet for a few months? 

JERRY

Your trench coat in my closet? 

BUCKLES

Jerry, my closet is packed to the gills, I'm afraid to open the door. Just for a few months. It'll make all the difference in the world. 

BUCKLES

We should see ``Rochelle Rochelle''. I hear it's really hot. 

JERRY

No thanks, maybe some other time. 

BUCKLES

Really? Do you really mean that? 

JERRY

No, I don't. 

BUCKLES

You liked the athlete's foot bit, right? 

JERRY

No. No. I was kidding. It's terrible. 

JERRY

Hi, I got some friends inside, I gotta get a message to 'em. Mind if I walk through real quick? 

USHER

[indicates ``okay''] 

KRAMER

Hey, did that guy show up? 

CLERK

The guy with the... horse face... and the big teeth... 

KRAMER

No, the guy with the big head and the flared nostrils. 

CLERK

Haven't seen him. There was a short guy with glasses... Looked like Humpty-Dumpty with a melon hat. But he left. 

WOMAN

So I got home, and he was vacuuming! I mean, he's twelve years old! Who else but my Alan would do something like that? 

WOMAN

And then last night, he put on my high heels. Oh, he put on such a show for us! He was dancing around, lip-sync'ing to ``A Chorus Line'', I mean you can see he's got talent. 

ELAINE

[annoyed] Excuse me, excuse me. 

WOMAN

What's the problem? 

ELAINE

[momentarily shocked, as if the answer were self-evident] You're talking. 

WOMAN

It's the ``Coming Attractions''. 

WOMAN

So anyway, he sings, he dances. And do you know what he's gotten into now? He is cooking! He does a crepe... 

USHER

Ticket, sir? 

GEORGE

Uh, I just went out, I went to look for my friend? 

USHER

Do you have your stub? 

GEORGE

[as if the word were totally foreign] My `stub'? 

USHER

Mm hm. 

GEORGE

You don't remember me? 

USHER

It's a big city, sir. 

GEORGE

I went in with a pretty woman? You know, kinda short, big wall o' hair, face like a frying pan? 

GEORGE

[whispering] Elaine? [loud whisper] Elaine! [louder whisper] Elaine! 

GEORGE

[quite out loud, not even pretending to whisper] Elaine! 

NARRATOR

The Village Voice calls it a masterpiece. A young woman's strange, erotic journey from Milan to Minsk. 

NARRATOR

It's a story about life. And love. And becoming a woman. ``Rochelle Rochelle'', now playing at Paradise 2. 

ELAINE

Uh, could I have a medium Diet Coke? 

CLERK

Do you want the Medium size or the middle size? 

ELAINE

What's the difference? 

CLERK

Well, we have three sizes. Medium, Large, and Jumbo. 

ELAINE

[momentarily perplexed] What happened to the small? 

CLERK

There is no small. Small is Medium. 

ELAINE

What's... medium? 

CLERK

Medium is Large, and large is Jumbo. 

ELAINE

Oh-kay. Gimme the large. 

CLERK

That's medium. 

ELAINE

Right. Yeah. [fearing the answer] Could I have a small popcorn? 

CLERK

There is no small. [flash of perky inspiration] Child-size is small. 

ELAINE

What's `medium'? 

CLERK

Adult. 

ELAINE

Do adults ever order the child-size? 

CLERK

[chuckling] Not usually. 

ELAINE

[laughs appreciably] Okay, gimme the `adult'. 

CLERK

Do you want butter? 

ELAINE

Is it *real* butter? 

CLERK

[perkily] It's butter-*flavored*! 

ELAINE

[exasperated] What is it made of? 

CLERK

[perkily] It's yellow! 

JERRY

44th and 9th. 

DRIVER

Have you got a cigarette? 

JERRY

No. 

USHER

Ticket, sir? 

GEORGE

We've just been through this! You don't remember? We just had this exact same conversation a minute ago! 

USHER

I need to see your stub. 

GEORGE

[realizing the only way out is to show the stub] I've got the stub. 

GEORGE

There you go, okay? That's my *other* friend's ticket. You happy now? You got two tickets. 

USHER

Ticket, sir? 

KRAMER

Uh, no, see, my friend already bought me a ticket. I'm late, and she's inside. 

USHER

Go ahead. 

KRAMER

Is that seat taken? 

ELAINE

It's all yours. 

JERRY

Gasoline? Can't you get it after you drop me off? 

DRIVER

[taken aback] No! Impossible! It is on `Empty'! 

MAN

You're soaking wet. Who are you? 

ROCHELLE

My name is Rochelle, I'm from Milan. I'm supposed to visit my relatives in Minsk. 

MAN

Here, stand by the fire. Take off those wet clothes, you'll catch cold. 

ROCHELLE

Oh, my hand's so cold, I can barely get these buttons open. 

ROCHELLE

Oh, that's much better. Much... 

ELAINE

I just went to get popcorn... Ugh... [shakes more popcorn] I just went to get popcorn, okay? And and and somebody took my seat, and my coat is in there! 

USHER

There's a seat in the front row. 

ELAINE

No no, I can't sit in the front row. 

USHER

Well, you're going to have to wait, then. 

ELAINE

I can't stand around here for *two hours*! 

USHER

I could let you see ``Rochelle Rochelle''. 

ELAINE

[heavy sarcasm] Oh. Thanks. 

ELAINE

Oh, hey, listen, by the way, have you seen a tall... lanky... doofus, with a, with a bird-face and hair like the Bride of Frankenstein? 

USHER

Haven't seen him. 

JERRY

Hey, did I make it? 

KERNIS

Sorry. 

JERRY

Oh, great. That's great. What a night. 

ANNOUNCER

Pat Buckles, ladies and gentlemen. Another round of applause for Pat Buckles! 

JERRY

You got my spot? 

BUCKLES

That athlete's foot bit killed! 

JERRY

Really... 

BUCKLES

Do you think I need to lose some weight? 

JERRY

Weight? Naw. Just need some more height. 

JERRY

My whole night's ruined. I didn't do any sets, didn't do any movies... 

BUCKLES

Come on, we can still catch most of ``Rochelle Rochelle''. 

JERRY

``Rochelle Rochelle'', huh? 

BUCKLES

A young girl's strange, erotic journey from Milan to Minsk. 

JERRY

[his interest piqued] Minsk? 

ELAINE

Oh, gimme a break! 

JERRY

Elaine? 

ELAINE

Jerry! 

JERRY

Elaine! 

VOICE

[whispered] Shut up. 

GEORGE

Jerry? 

JERRY

George? 

GEORGE

Elaine? 

ELAINE

George! [waves hi] 

JERRY

Hey, where's Kramer? 

VOICE

[whispered] Will you shut up? 

ELAINE

I don't know. Does this movie stink or what! 

JERRY

Let's get outta here. [to Buckles] I'll see ya. 

BUCKLES

You're leaving? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

BUCKLES

[holding out his coat] Jerry, take the coat. Please. One month. 

JERRY

I don't want the coat. 

BUCKLES

Jerry! Call me when you get home so I know you're okay! 

GEORGE

[studying his jacket] Oh man! Look at this! I sat in gum. Oh, by the way, you owe me seven fifty. 

JERRY

I didn't even use the ticket! 

GEORGE

I still paid for it! 

JERRY

I only have a twenty. 

ELAINE

That's my coat! Gimme that. Where did you get that? 

KRAMER

It was on the seat... 

ELAINE

*YOU* took my seat!? 

GEORGE

You uh owe me for the ticket. 

KRAMER

Yeah, right... 

ELAINE

What is that stain [on my coat]? 

KRAMER

It's yellow mustard. [To George] Can you break a twenty? 

GEORGE

So you're a lawyer. What kind of cases do you handle? 

CHERYL

Oh, everything. Divorce, patents, immigration and naturalization. 

GEORGE

What is that, immigrants come over, you show them how to act natural? 

GEORGE

No, they're not funny at all. No, I have no funny friends. I'm the funny one. El Clowno. 

ELAINE

Look, I was nice enough to pick it up for you 

JERRY

Hey, I've been back four days, I want my mail. 

ELAINE

It's mostly bills, magazines and junk mail anyway. 

JERRY

Elaine, that's what mail is. Without bills, magazines and junk mail, there is no mail. 

CHERYL

Here's my card. 

GEORGE

Oh, ok. Thank you. It was good talking to you. 

CHERYL

Nice meeting you. 

GEORGE

Yeah. 

ELAINE

Hi! 

JERRY

Hey, how ya doin? 

GEORGE

You would not believe what just happened. I was waiting for you and this woman was sitting at the counter. 

ELAINE

What, the one who just left? 

GEORGE

Yeah, yeah, and we started talking, and she's this lawyer who's incredible! Everything I said was funny! You know, she laughed at everything I said, she thinks I'm hilarious. You know in a way, it was almost too good. I started so good, I can't go any place but down now, ya know? I got no place to go. 

ELAINE

Yeah, well, I guess it's all over. 

JERRY

(looking behind the counter) Hey, is that Babu? It is! (walking over) Hey, Babu! 

BABU

Jerry! 

JERRY

Look at you, you got the job. 

BABU

Yes, yes, they give me job thanks to you. 

JERRY

Oh, I didn't do anything. 

BABU

Yes, you do everything, get me job, you get me a place to live in your building. 

JERRY

Come on. 

BABU

You very very good man, you do everything for me. My family and I can never thank you enough for everything you do. 

GEORGE

You see, this is what I do with women. I start out too strong, now I have to become real, that's when it all falls apart. What good is real? They don't want real, they want funny. 

ELAINE

No they don't. 

GEORGE

Ooooh, yes they do. 

ELAINE

Nooo. 

GEORGE

Ya gotta put on a show, ya always gotta give them a big show. You always have to be 'on' otherwise why would they like me? They'd just go for a better looking guy with more money. 

GEORGE

You mean that's true, I'm right?! 

JERRY

Ok, great, well, I'm glad everything worked out, Babu. 

BABU

Oh, yes, yes, everything wonderful. 

JERRY

Ok, I'll see you around the building. 

BABU

I'll see you *in* the building. 

JERRY

(returning to the table) Remember Babu Bhatt? 

GEORGE

Who's he? 

JERRY

Remember that guy who opened the restaurant across the street from the building last year and he wasn't doing so well and I told him he should make it into all Pakistani and that drove him right out of business? So, you uh, going with me to the auto show with me Saturday? 

ELAINE

Yeah, yeah. 

JERRY

Can you bring my mail then? 

GEORGE

What mail? 

ELAINE

I picked up his mail while he was on the road 

GEORGE

Why didn't Kramer pick it up? 

JERRY

Cause he's at that baseball fantasy camp in Florida. 

GEORGE

Oh yeah, right. When's he coming back? 

JERRY

Monday, I think. 

GEORGE

Kramer goes to a fantasy camp. His whole life is a fantasy camp. People should plunk down two-thousand dollars to live like him for a week. Do nothing, fall ass-backwards into money, mooch food off your neighbors and have sex without dating; that's a fantasy camp. 

JERRY

Hey listen, if you're gonna go out with this lawyer, why don't you have dinner with us and then maybe you can go to the auto show with her if you want, you know, have a little company, take the pressure off. 

JERRY

...he never heard of corduroy! 

CHERYL

(howling with laughter) Stop it, you're killing me!! 

JERRY

He never heard of corduroy! True story, true story. 

GEORGE

No, no I don't think so. 

ELAINE

Why? 

GEORGE

Well I think I'm better off going one-on-one. 

JERRY

I don't know why you want to play man-to-man when you could play a zone. 

GEORGE

She might not be comfortable. 

ELAINE

Why? We're all very nice, we're very friendly. 

JERRY

We'll be funny. 

GEORGE

No! No. It's not good, I don't think so. 

ELAINE

Alright, well if you change your mind, we'll wind up as Isabella's probably around seven. 

JERRY

No, no Isabella's, I don't want to go to Isabella's. 

ELAINE

Why? 

JERRY

No, it's too trendy, no Isabella's. 

GEORGE

(tasting the wine) Excellent. Like I really know what I'm talking about. 

GEORGE

Toasting makes me uncomfortable. But toast, I love. Never start the day without a good piece of toast. In fact, let's toast to toast. 

JERRY

Look who's here! Georgie-boy! 

GEORGE

What are you doing here? I thought you said you hated Isabella's? 

ELAINE

No, I talked him into it. 

GEORGE

What happened to the auto show? 

JERRY

Oh, we're still going, we're still going. Elaine, do the spokes model. 

ELAINE

The turbo quadramatic transmission offers you the power and prestige to propel you well into the 21st century. 

GEORGE

Cheryl, Elaine, and uh, Jerry. 

CHERYL

Would you like to join us? 

GEORGE

Oh no no no, they don't want to join us. 

CHERYL

Oh no, it's ok, don't be silly. 

ELAINE

Ok, well why don't we just put these two tables together? 

GEORGE

(as the others are repositioning the tables) No, no, you can't do that, they're round, it makes an 'eight' and, yeah, well alright. 

ELAINE

Jerry? Jerry, tell them that funny story you were telling me-- 

GEORGE

No! No. 

ELAINE

No George, it's so funny. We saw this cab driver's picture, right? 

GEORGE

(interrupting) You know we should really order, the service is so slow here, by the time you get anything... 

ELAINE

Oh, Cheryl, can I ask you a legal question? Um, I'm being sued. 

CHERYL

Oh? What happened? 

ELAINE

Well, I ran out to apologize to a virgin and I crossed against the light and I knocked over the delivery boy. 

CHERYL

Was he Chinese? 

ELAINE

Yeah. 

CHERYL

Is your last name Benes? 

JERRY

How did you know? 

CHERYL

Ping is my cousin! 

ELAINE

No! 

JERRY

That's so funny! 

CHERYL

I'm handling his case! 

ELAINE

What? You're Cheryl Fong? 

CHERYL

That's right! 

ELAINE

Oh my god, I can't believe it! That is such a coincidence! 

CHERYL

Yeah, I know! 

ELAINE

Wow, well, I guess you don't have any advice for me on how to win the case? 

CHERYL

Will you excuse me? I have to make a call. 

ELAINE

Tell Ping I said hello. 

JERRY

Tell him you think you may have broken the case wide open. 

JERRY

What? 

GEORGE

This is not good. This is not good. 

JERRY

What's the matter? 

GEORGE

I just don't think it's such a great idea for you to sit here. 

JERRY

Why not? 

ELAINE

He thinks that if you're too funny, he might not look so funny. 

JERRY

Biff? 

GEORGE

What? 

JERRY

You're not worried about that? 

GEORGE

No, of course not. 

JERRY

I mean, so what if I'm funny? Who cares? 

ELAINE

He thinks that if a woman sees a guy put on a better show, she'll walk out on his show, go see the other show. 

JERRY

Well, should we leave? 

GEORGE

Maybe you don't have to be so funny. I mean, would it kill you not to be so funny all the time? That's all I'm asking. This woman thinks I'm very funny. Now you're gonna be funny, so what am I gonna be? I'm gonna be a short bald guy with glasses who suddenly doesn't seem so funny. 

ELAINE

This is so ridiculous. Can we just go over there? 

JERRY

I don't have to be funny, I don't care. 

GEORGE

You don't? 

JERRY

No way! It's completely under my control. 

ELAINE

No, it's not. You cannot not be funny. 

JERRY

Of course I can, am I being funny now? 

ELAINE

A little. 

JERRY

Oh, this is funny? I'm being funny? 

ELAINE

Yeah. 

JERRY

George, is this funny? 

GEORGE

It's funny! (To Elaine) and it wouldn't kill you to not be so funny either. 

ELAINE

What? What did I do? 

GEORGE

Hi. 

JERRY

(subdued, almost somber) Hello. Welcome back. 

CHERYL

Sorry, it was my aunt's birthday and she makes such a big deal about it. 

ELAINE

Well, nobody likes to get old, right? 

JERRY

Well, birthdays are merely symbolic of how another year has gone by and how little we've grown. No matter how desperate we are that someday a better self will emerge, with each flicker of the candles on the cake, we know it's not to be, that for the rest of our sad, wretched pathetic lives, this is who we are to the bitter end. Inevitably, irrevocably; happy birthday? No such thing. 

GEORGE

Funny guy, huh? 

ELAINE

Here, take it. I was glad to get rid of it. 

JERRY

Well thank you very much, it's about time. 

ELAINE

Oh listen, guess what? Cheryl convinced Ping to drop the case against me. 

JERRY

Drop the case? Well, congratulations, that'll save you some money. 

ELAINE

Yeah, no kidding. That lawyer was gonna charge me a fortune. 

JERRY

(leafing through his mail) Oh great, a birth announcement from Arnie and Joy Harris. 

JERRY

Hear that? Guess who's back. (Opening the door) Hey! 

KRAMER

Hey. 

JERRY

I thought you weren't coming back till Monday. 

KRAMER

Well, the camp ended a few days early. 

JERRY

Why? 

KRAMER

Uh, well there was an incident. 

JERRY

What happened? 

KRAMER

I punched Mickey Mantle in the mouth. 

JERRY

What? 

KRAMER

Yeah, I punched him and they took him to the hospital and then they canceled the rest of the week. 

ELAINE

You punched who in the mouth? 

KRAMER

Mickey Mantle. 

JERRY

What happened? 

KRAMER

Well, you know, we were playing a game and, you know, I was pitching, and I was really throwing some smoke. And Joe Pepitone, he was up, and man that guy, you know, he was crowding the plate. 

JERRY

Wow! Joe Pepitone! 

KRAMER

Yeah, well, Joe Pepitone or not, I own the inside of that plate. So I throw one, you know, inside, you know, a little chin music, put him right on his pants. Cause I gotta intimidate when I'm on the mound. Well the next pitch, he's right back in the same place. So, I had to plunk him. 

JERRY

You plunked him. 

KRAMER

Oh yeah. Well, he throws down his bat, he comes racing up to the mound. Next thing, both benches are cleared, you know? A brouhaha breaks out between the guys in the camp, you know, and the old Yankee players, and as I'm trying to get Moose Skowron off of one of my teammates, you know, somebody pulls me from behind, you know, and I turned around and I popped him. I looked down, and woah man, it's Mickey. I punched his lights out. 

JERRY

Wow, this is incredible! 

BABU

Leave me alone! You can't do this to me! 

JERRY

What's going on out there? 

BABU

What are you doing? This is not right, people. You're making a very bad mistake, very bad. 

JERRY

Babu? (leaving) I'll be right back. 

ELAINE

(to Kramer) Yeah, so? 

KRAMER

Then Hank Bauer, you know, he's screaming, 'Mickey! Mickey! What have you done with Mickey? You killed Mickey!' 

ELAINE

So what'd you do? 

KRAMER

Well, I got the hell out of there. 

ELAINE

They took Babu away?! 

JERRY

Yeah, the Immigration guy said his Visa was expired. Poor Babu, everything was going so well for him. He had an apartment, he had a job. What a shame. 

JERRY

I will, Babu! I will help you, Babu, don't worry! 

KRAMER

Then Hank Bauer, you know, he's chasing me around, he trips over third base and knocks over Clete Boyer. 

JERRY

(thumbing through his mail) Uh oh. 

ELAINE

What? 

JERRY

Well this is interesting. 

ELAINE

What is it? 

JERRY

It's a letter from the Immigration Bureau, it's Babu's Visa renewal application form. They must have put it in my mailbox by mistake. 

KRAMER

Well, doesn't he need that? 

JERRY

If you had given me my mail last week when I got home, this whole thing never would have happened. 

ELAINE

Well, you should have come to my house to pick it up. 

JERRY

Yeah, so am I being funny now? 

ELAINE

No, actually, you're not being funny now. 

JERRY

See, I told you I wasn't funny all the time. (George enters) Hey George, look, I'm not funny now. 

GEORGE

No, and you weren't funny last night either. In fact, you got us both so depressed, she asked me to drive her home after dinner. 

JERRY

Oh look, I need to get in touch with Cheryl. Babu needs a lawyer, his Visa's expired. 

GEORGE

What do you need her for? There's a million lawyers. 

JERRY

Yeah, but you said this is one of the things that her firm does. 

GEORGE

Alright, alright, but no funny business, same deal as last night. 

JERRY

Ah, will you stop it already? 

GEORGE

Jerry, please? 

JERRY

How long is this gonna go on? 

GEORGE

Till I'm comfortable. 

JERRY

Well, when is that gonna be? 

GEORGE

After consummation. 

JERRY

Consummation? I don't think you have enough material. 

CHERYL

I actually have a friend in the Immigration Department who owes me a big favor. You're very lucky. 

JERRY

(somber) That's wonderful news. Thank you. 

CHERYL

You're a very serious person, aren't you? 

JERRY

Well, with so many people in the world deprived and unhappy, it doesn't seem like it would be fair to be cheerful. 

CHERYL

I understand. 

CHERYL

I think it's curdled. 

JERRY

I don't care. 

CHERYL

Do you ever laugh? 

JERRY

Not really. Sometimes, when I'm in the tub. 

CHERYL

That's so sad. What do you do? 

JERRY

I'm a comedian. Oh, let me get that. (reaching for the check) You've been so helpful. 

ELAINE

(entering as Jerry heads to the register) Hey, we're gonna go see Babu now, right? 

JERRY

Yeah, I'll just pay for this. 

ELAINE

Oh, I'm just gonna go say hi to Cheryl. (walking over to the booth) Hi. 

CHERYL

Hi. 

ELAINE

Listen, gosh, I wanted to thank you so much for convincing Ping to drop the case. 

CHERYL

Well, after we met, you were all so nice. I just couldn't go through with it. But between you and me, you would have paid through the nose. 

JERRY

Babu! 

BABU

Jerry! Jerry, hello Jerry! 

JERRY

You remember Elaine. 

BABU

Yes, yes of course! 

ELAINE

Nice to meet you. 

BABU

So nice of you both to come. 

JERRY

Oh, Babu. 

BABU

No no, you're both very kind, very kind. 

ELAINE

We try. 

JERRY

We do what we can. 

ELAINE

We do what we can. 

BABU

The problem is I never got my Visa renewal form in the mail. I was expecting it. 

JERRY

Yes, well, see, here's the thing, Babu. Um, what happened was I was away for a couple of weeks doing some comedy shows. 

BABU

Comedy shows! You're a very funny man. 

JERRY

Well, Elaine here was picking up my mail while I was away, because you know that little box can get very full. 

BABU

Oh yes, of course. TV Guide, magazines, everything. You know, I would have picked up your mail, your box is right next to mine. 

JERRY

Oh, I don't want to bother you. 

BABU

No bother! You get me job, you get me apartment, you very very good man. 

JERRY

So yesterday, after they took you away, I looked in my mail and I noticed that the mailman accidentally put your Visa renewal in my mail box. 

BABU

Come again? 

JERRY

You see, I've been home for a week and Elaine didn't give me my mail until yesterday, even though I asked her repeatedly for it. 

ELAINE

Yeah, but Babu, he could have come to my house to pick it up. 

BABU

You had my Visa application?! 

JERRY

Well not technically. 

BABU

(extremely and suddenly agitated) I kill you!! 

JERRY

Well what about her? 

BABU

I kill both of you!! 

JERRY

Babu?! 

BABU

No Babu! No Babu! You bad man! You very bad man! You very lazy bad man! 

JERRY

Babu, I'm gonna fix everything! I have a lawyer who knows someone in the Immigration Department, they're gonna straighten the whole thing out, the wheels are in motion, things are happening even as we speak! 

BABU

The wheels are in motion? 

JERRY

The wheels are in motion, things are happening! 

GEORGE

Jerry? 

CHERYL

I'm very attracted to him. 

GEORGE

You think the person you were talking to is him? That's not even close to him. He's funny, Jerry's funny. 

CHERYL

He never said anything funny. 

GEORGE

He can't not be funny. 

CHERYL

No no no, he's dark. And disturbed. 

GEORGE

Dark and disturbed? His whole life revolves around Superman and cereal. I convinced him to act like that so that you would think I was funnier. That's how disturbed I am! If you want disturbed, that's disturbed. You can't find sickness like that anywhere, you think sickness like that grows on trees? Nobody is sicker than me, nobody. He's pretending, I'm the genuine article. 

CHERYL

So you're telling me Jerry's whole thing was an act? 

GEORGE

Yes! And I put him up to it, because I'm sick! I'm the one that needs help. 

CHERYL

I gotta go. 

GEORGE

Well, should I call you later? 

CHERYL

Please don't. 

GEORGE

But, but I'm disturbed! I'm depressed! I'm inadequate! I got it all!! 

ELAINE

So, what's up with Babu? How come he's not back? 

JERRY

I don't know, I don't understand it. Cheryl was supposed to take care 

GEORGE

It's George. 

JERRY

C'mon up. 

JERRY

Babu must be back. 

BROTHER

Babu, my goodness, what has happened to you? 

JERRY

Where's Babu? 

BROTHER

He is in Pakistan! 

JERRY

Who are you? 

BROTHER

I am his brother. He knew a lawyer, it was all going to be fixed. 

JERRY

I'm sure the lawyer did everything they could. 

BROTHER

Then where is Babu? What happened to Babu? Show me Babu! 

ELAINE

(offering a drink) Snapple? 

BROTHER

No, too fruity. 

JERRY

Hey, what happened? I thought Cheryl was gonna help Babu get his Visa. 

GEORGE

She didn't help him? 

JERRY

No. 

GEORGE

Where is he? 

JERRY

He's in Pakistan. 

GEORGE

Oh boy. 

JERRY

What do you mean, oh boy? 

GEORGE

Well, last night she told me that she liked you. Not you, the disturbed you, so I had to tell her the truth. 

JERRY

Told her the truth? Well, you got Babu deported. 

GEORGE

What do you mean, I got? You didn't give him his Visa application. 

JERRY

That's because she had my mail. 

ELAINE

Yeah, well I wouldn't have had to get your mail if he hadn't gone to that fantasy camp. 

KRAMER

Well, I just came back from Mickey Mantle's restaurant. 

JERRY

How could you go in there? 

KRAMER

Well, I had to. I had to apologize. I mean, I punched Mickey Mantle, my idol. It was eating me up inside! 

JERRY

Well, what happened? 

KRAMER

I got down in my knees and went, 'Go ahead, Mickey. Hit me. I'm begging you, Mickey, please hit me. C'mon, hit me. I love you, Mickey, I love you!' 

ELAINE

So, what did he do? 

KRAMER

Well, the four of them, they picked me up by my pants and they threw me outside, right into a horse. 

VOICE

Kramer? 

KRAMER

Yeah? It's my Chinese food. 

ELAINE

Oh! Ping! Hi! Listen, thank you so much for dropping that lawsuit against me. 

PING

Not anymore. 

ELAINE

What? 

PING

Cheryl call me last night, lawsuit back on. 

ELAINE

Why? 

PING

She call you and your friends big liars. You think she nice girl? Wait till you see her in court. She's a shark! They call her the Terminator. She never lose a case. Now you make her mad. She double the damages. Hasta la vista, baby. 

BABU

So his friend got the mail but she did not give it to him. And then he came to visit me. Said the lawyer was called to help, he said the wheels were in motion, but there was no motion. There was nothing. And so they sent me back here. 

FRIEND

This is a terrible story, Babu. What are you going to do? 

BABU

I'm going to save up every rupee. Someday, I will get back to America, and when I do I will exact vengeance on this man. I cannot forget him. He haunts me. He is a very bad man. He is a very very bad man. 

GEORGE

Wait a second, wait a second...and then the butler says, 'I'm not cleanin' it up! I'm sick of cleaning!' 

JERRY

That's funny, that's funny! 'I'm sick of cleaning.' That's very funny. 

GEORGE

I'll tell you something, I've never seen a pilot script as funny as this! 

JERRY

Yeah, it's funny! 

GEORGE

I mean, how funny is this? 

JERRY

It's funny. 

GEORGE

I mean, we're not stupid, right? We know when something's funny! 

JERRY

It cannot not be funny! Now come on, let's stay with it, we gotta finish this today. 

GEORGE

Okay. Hey, you know what, maybe I should give it to my therapist to read. She's smart, I trust her. 

JERRY

Yeah, maybe I'll give it to Elaine. 

GEORGE

Hey, you know, we haven't brought the Elaine character into the show yet. Umm, We should try and get her into this scene. 

JERRY

Right, right. Okay. (Writing) Elaine enters. 

GEORGE

Right 

JERRY

(Thinks) What does she say...? 

GEORGE

I don't know, what do women say? 

JERRY

I don't know. 

GEORGE

I don't even know what they think. That's why I'm in therapy. 

JERRY

You know, if we bring Elaine in, it's going to be so many people to keep track of. It's gonna be too hard, I'll forget where everybody's standing, you, me, Kramer, the butler, it's too much. 

GEORGE

Alright, forget Elaine. 

JERRY

Alright. (They tear the pages out of their notepads. Kramer enters.) 

KRAMER

Hey. 

GEORGE

Hey. 

JERRY

Hey. 

KRAMER

You are never gonna believe who I just ran into today. 

JERRY

Who? 

KRAMER

Your old flame. Gail Cunningham. 

JERRY

Did you talk to her? 

KRAMER

Well, I was on my way to the Y, and I saw her coming towards me? I didn't know what to do! Because I remembered you had three dates with her and she wouldn't kiss you goodnight. So now I'm thinking you know, what is my duty to my friend? Do I acknowledge her? Do I you know ignore her? I mean, what is my responsibility here? 

JERRY

So what happened? 

KRAMER

Yeah, yeah, so she sees me and she goes, (imitates Gail) 'Oh, hi! Kramer!' You know? Like nothing happened! Like she never you know went three dates with you and refused to kiss you goodnight. 

JERRY

Yeah, I know about the three dates. 

KRAMER

You know what I did? I snubbed her. 

JERRY

What do you mean, you snubbed her? 

KRAMER

I walked right by her - bffffft - never said a word. 

JERRY

Right by her? 

KRAMER

Right by her! 

JERRY

What you do say about a guy like this, huh! (George applauds.) You are some great friend, I tell ya, snubbed her! (seriously) Not that I condone it. I've never condoned snubbing in my administration. But your loyalty is beyond question. 

KRAMER

Yeah. Well, you know, she was lucky I was in a good mood - coulda been a lot worse. 

ELAINE

I'm not even in here! 

JERRY

Yeah, I know. 

ELAINE

Well, I thought there was going to be a character named Elaine Benes. 

JERRY

Well, there were too many people in the room, we couldn't keep track of everybody. George, and the butler, and... 

ELAINE

You couldn't 'keep track' of everybody? 

JERRY

Well, we tried. We couldn't. We didn't know how to, uh...(confessing) ...we couldn't write for a woman. We didn't know what you would say. Even right now, I'm sitting here, I know you're going to say something, I have no idea what it is. 

ELAINE

You have no idea? 

JERRY

Something derogatory? (Gail enters the coffee shop and walks over to the booth.) 

GAIL

I thought I'd find you here. 

JERRY

Well, Gail Cunningham. 

ELAINE

Hi, Gail. 

GAIL

Hi, Elaine. (To Jerry) Hey, what is with your friend Kramer? 

JERRY

Why? 

GAIL

He snubbed me. 

JERRY

Are you sure? 

GAIL

Yeah, I'm sure. What did you tell him? 

JERRY

Nothing. (Elaine grabs Jerry's sandwich and is about to take a bite.) Hey, where you goin' with that? Gimme that. (Takes back the sandwich.) 

ELAINE

I thought you were finished. 

JERRY

I took two bites, how am I finished? (Elaine coughs.) Plus you're coming down with something? You want me to get sick? (Offers Gail the sandwich) Bite? 

GAIL

So, how come? Why did Kramer do that? 

JERRY

I don't know. Once he leaves the building, he's out of my jurisdiction. 

GAIL

Well, tell him that I am mad at him. 

JERRY

Alright. So, where ya cookin' now? 

GAIL

Pfeiffer's. 

JERRY

Ah, the power lunch crowd. 

GAIL

Nice shoes! 

ELAINE

Oh. Thank you. 

GAIL

Where'd you get 'em? 

ELAINE

They're um, Botticelli's. 

GAIL

Ooh, Botticelli's! Look at you! I'm afraid to go in there. 

ELAINE

Really. 

JERRY

Would you care to join us? 

GAIL

No, no, I gotta get to the restaurant. (Looks at her watch.) Oh! See ya. (Exits.) 

JERRY

See ya. 

ELAINE

'Oh, look at you, the Botticelli's.' 

JERRY

That bothered you? 

ELAINE

Yes, it bothered me. So I bought a pair of shoes at Botticelli's, I'm not allowed to shop there? That really embarrassed me. 

JERRY

It did? 

ELAINE

Yes! Couldn't you see that? 

JERRY

No. This is why you're not in the pilot. 

DANA

Well, George, I think you're beginning to get some perspective on things. I think we're making progress. 

GEORGE

Yeah, I feel like I've grown. 

DANA

Good. So, let's pick up on this next week. 

GEORGE

Great. (They both stand.) Oh, by the way, did you get a chance to read the script? 

DANA

Yes, yes I did. 

GEORGE

Well, what'd you think? 

DANA

Uh...it was...good. 

GEORGE

You didn't like it? 

DANA

Well, no, I - 

GEORGE

I can't believe this! What was wrong with it? What didn't you like about it? 

DANA

It wasn't funny. 

GEORGE

It wasn't funny? What, are you kidding? 

DANA

No, I didn't find it funny. 

GEORGE

You didn't find it funny?! This is what I'm paying for? 

DANA

Well, that whole storyline about a guy who gets into a car accident, doesn't have any insurance, so the judge sentences him to be a butler? I didn't really buy that. 

GEORGE

Let me tell you who did, uh, buy it...um we pitched this story to Russell Dalrymple, the president of NBC, and he ate it up with a spoon. 

DANA

George, if you're going to be in a creative field, you're going to have to learn how to deal with criticism. 

GEORGE

How's this for criticism? Um...you stink. How do like that criticism? You know what's funny to me? That diploma up on the wall. That is my idea of 'com-med-dee'! You sitting here, telling people what to do. 

DANA

I think you'd better go. 

GEORGE

Oh, I'm goin' baby. I'm goin.' (Heads for the door, then stops.) It's Jerry's fault. He took out all my good lines. He's such a control freak! 

GEORGE

So, you send me to this therapist to help me with my emotional disorders, and she criticizes our script. (Tosses the script to Jerry.) What kind of a therapist is that? 

ELAINE

I guess she didn't think it was funny. 

GEORGE

Oh, she didn't think it was funny. What is she, Rowan & Martin? We're supposed to meet with NBC tomorrow! She completely shattered my confidence. And I'm paying for this, she's my employee! 

JERRY

I thought your mother's paying for it. 

GEORGE

And she slaves to earn every penny. So that someday, I might be able to walk up to a woman and say, 'Yes, I'm bald, but I'm still a good person.' 

JERRY

You know, he's right. It's not her place to criticize the script, which reminds me - what did you think of it? You never told me. 

ELAINE

What did I think of it? (Manufactures a cough instead of answering. Kramer enters.) 

KRAMER

Hey, buddy, I got something to tell ya. (Elaine runs towards to the bathroom in lieu of answering Jerry's question.) 

JERRY

Hey, one second, you don't get off that easy. C'mon, tell me what you thought. 

ELAINE

Well, you know, I... 

KRAMER

I just kissed Gail Cunningham. (Jerry turns and looks at Kramer, shocked. Elaine grins and heads to the bathroom.) 

JERRY

You what? 

KRAMER

Yeah, I kissed her. 

JERRY

You kissed her? 

KRAMER

Right on the mouth. 

JERRY

What kinda great friend are you? How do you go from snubbing to kissing? 

KRAMER

Well, I saw her outside the Y, you know, she came up to me, she started yelling because I snubbed her, and then we started talking a little bit, and I walked her to her building. And just before I left, I put my arm around her waist, I pulled her to me, and I - mmm - I planted one! (Laughs.) 

JERRY

And what did she do? 

KRAMER

She kissed me back. 

JERRY

I don't get this. I go out with this girl three times, she doesn't want to shake my hand - why's she kissing you? 

KRAMER

Because I snubbed her. You see? Women, they like that! Yes! I understand women. The snub is good, they love the snub! 

GEORGE

No they don't. I tried that once. I snubbed for a year. Nothing. Every woman I saw, I snubbed. You never saw people so pleased. (Elaine returns from the bathroom.) 

KRAMER

Ooh, so...I understand you're buying your shoes now at Botticelli's. 

ELAINE

What? Who told you that? 

KRAMER

Gail Cunningham. 

ELAINE

I don't understand, why is this woman talking about my shoes? Why are my shoes a topic of conversation? 

KRAMER

Well, you know, we were just talking, and uh she mentioned how you're buying your shoes now at Botticelli's. 

ELAINE

'How I'm buying my shoes now at Botticelli's!' Did you hear this? (Shoves Jerry and Kramer.) 

JERRY

So what? 

ELAINE

So what?! She is talking about my shoes! She is discussing my shoes! It is nobody's business where I buy my shoes! (Storms over to the couch and angrily sits down. Jerry, Kramer and George look at Elaine from the kitchen, comically puzzled by her outburst...) 

ELAINE

Hey! Gail! 

GAIL

Ya. (noticing it's Elaine) Elaine...! 

ELAINE

Why are you talking about my shoes? 

GAIL

What? 

ELAINE

My Botticelli shoes. You've been talking about my Botticelli shoes. 

GAIL

What are you talking about? 

ELAINE

Did you or did you not tell Kramer that I got my shoes at Botticelli's? (A waiter comes over and puts a plate of food on Gail's cutting board.) 

WAITER

Too spicy. He wants another one. You got that pasta primavera? 

GAIL

Look Elaine, I am very busy here. 

ELAINE

Who else have you mentioned my shoes to, huh? I wanna know why my footwear is your conversation! 

GAIL

I am not discussing this. This is insane. 

WAITER

You got that pasta primavera? Let's go! 

GAIL

Ya ya ya, here. 

WAITER

Here you are, Mr. Dalrymple. 

RUSSELL

Thank you. 

WAITER

Sorry for the delay. Enjoy your lunch. 

RUSSELL

Well, come in. (They shake hands.) 

GEORGE

Hi. 

RUSSELL

Awfully sorry to make you come up here, but I really wasn't feeling well enough to go back to the office, and well, it's the only chance I have to meet with you this week. 

JERRY

Are you alright? 

RUSSELL

Well, it's my stomach. I think there must have been something in the pasta primavera I had for lunch. 

JERRY

Oh, Where did you eat? 

RUSSELL

Pfeiffer's. 

JERRY

Ah. I know the chef there. 

RUSSELL

Yeah. The food's usually terrific. 

GEORGE

My cousin worked for Bouchard's. They used to use the bouilla-base for a toilet. (Jerry and Russell are shocked.) 

RUSSELL

What are you saying? 

GEORGE

Well, you didn't hear it from me, but needless to say, if you go in there - stick with the consumee. 

RUSSELL

Well, we'd better get started, my daughter's going to be here soon. 

JERRY

Oh, you have a daughter? 

RUSSELL

Yeah, she just turned fifteen last week. 

GEORGE

Aw, that's a fun age. (Jerry looks at George distastefully.) 

RUSSELL

Alright. The script. Now, I've read this thing three times...and everytime I read it...(looks nauseous, struggles not to vomit.) 

JERRY

What? 

RUSSELL

Excuse me for a second. (Gets up and runs to the bathroom.) 

JERRY

What? 

GEORGE

Would you like a Pepto-Bismol? I keep them in my wallet...! (Russell goes into the bathroom and shuts the door.) (To Jerry) Do you think he liked it? (From the bathroom, we hear Russell violently heaving his guts.) 

JERRY

I'm not sure. (The sounds of Russell vomiting emanate from the bathroom. Jerry and George sit there uncomfortably.) What was that dish he said he had...? 

GEORGE

Pasta primavera. 

JERRY

Ah. You know, 'primavera' is Italian for 'spring.' 

GEORGE

No! 

JERRY

Yeah. 

RUSSELL

Really, I'm terribly sorry, it just, uh...all of a sudden it just hit me. 

GEORGE

So, you were saying how, um...about the script... 

RUSSELL

Right. The script. Your script needs some...it needs, um...(looks nauseous again. Gets up and runs to the bathroom a second time.) 

GEORGE

More jokes? 

JERRY

Another ending? 

GEORGE

A different name for the butler? (Russell throws up again.) 

JERRY

Maybe we should go. 

GEORGE

We haven't heard his notes yet, we don't know how he feels about our work. (Russell throws up yet again.) 

RUSSELL

Oh God. Oh my god. 

JERRY

I can't listen to anymore of this, the guy's losing a lung in there. (Russell's daughter Molly enters.) 

MOLLY

Hello. 

JERRY

Hi. 

GEORGE

Hi. 

MOLLY

I'm Molly. 

JERRY

Oh, I'm Jerry. 

GEORGE

George. 

JERRY

We're here discussing our script with your father. 

GEORGE

He just read it. (Russell vomits again. Jerry and George look ashamed.) 

MOLLY

Daddy? Are you okay? 

RUSSELL

Yeah, yeah sweetie. I'm fine. (Molly sits on the back of the chair.) 

GEORGE

So, you live with your mother, huh? 

MOLLY

Uh, yeah. 

GEORGE

Divorce is very difficult. Especially on a kid. 

JERRY

Uh huh. 

GEORGE

Of course, I'm the result of my parents having stayed together, so you never know. (Russell comes out of the bathroom.) 

MOLLY

Daddy, are you alright? What's the matter? 

RUSSELL

It's just a stomach thing. 

MOLLY

Yuck. 

RUSSELL

We're going to have to do this some other time, so if you'll give me your number, I'll call you later. (Jerry and George nod. Molly takes her jacket off.) 

GEORGE

You know, suddenly I'm in the mood for pasta primavera myself. (Jerry nudges George to sneak a peek at Molly's cleavage as she bends over and looks in her backpack. Jerry has a quick look, but George stares, hypnotized. Russell comes up behind George.) 

RUSSELL

Get a good look, Costanza? 

JERRY

What were you doing? 

GEORGE

Well, it's not my fault. You poked me! 

JERRY

You're supposed to just take a peek after a poke. You were like you just put a quarter into one of those big metal things on top of the Empire State Building. 

GEORGE

It's cleavage. I couldn't look away. What am I, waiting to win an Oscar here? This is all I have in my life. 

JERRY

Looking at cleavage is like looking at the sun, you don't stare at it. It's too risky. You get a sense of it and then you look away. 

GEORGE

All right. So, he caught me in a cleavage peek, so big deal. Who wouldn't look at his daughter's cleavage? She's got nice cleavage. 

JERRY

That's why I poked. 

GEORGE

That's why I peeked. (Jerry opens the door to take some trash out, and meets Kramer and Gail in the hallway.) 

GAIL

Hey! What is with your friend Elaine? 

JERRY

What? 

GAIL

She comes to my restaurant, comes right in my kitchen, and starts complaining that I'm talking about her shoes. 

JERRY

She did? 

KRAMER

Right in the kitchen. Disgraceful. 

GAIL

So, I don't want people coming into my kitchen. I think she might have sneezed all over someone's pasta primavera. Someone might have gotten sick because of her. (Kramer and Gail exit.) 

GEORGE

Pasta primavera? 

JERRY

Is that what she said? (Kramer pokes his head back in the door.) 

KRAMER

She's somethin', huh? She's a wild one. She's wearin' me out. 

JERRY

She is? 

KRAMER

She's sensual. You know, with the...cooking and all. (Kramer grins happily at Jerry and leaves. The phone rings. Jerry tosses the trashbag to George.) 

JERRY

Hello? Oh, hi Stu. 

GEORGE

From NBC? 

JERRY

(to George) Yeah. (oh the phone) What's goin' on? What? Really? Oh my god....did he give you a reason?...Oh boy. Okay. Alright. Thanks. (hangs up.) Dalrymple just cancelled the pilot. (George drops the bag, shocked.) 

JERRY

If you hadn't gone into her restaurant, this never would have happened. 

ELAINE

Look, I don't like people talking about my shoes behind my back, okay? My shoes are my business. The two of you shouldn't have been looking at some fifteen year-old's cleavage anyway! 

GEORGE

He poked me! 

JERRY

There was cleavage in the area. That's a reflex - (mimics nudging someone with an elbow) - cleavage-poke, cleavage-poke... 

ELAINE

But she was fifteen. 

JERRY

You don't consider age in the face of cleavage. This occurs on a molecular level, you can't control it! We're like some kind of weird fish where the eyes operate independently of the head. 

GEORGE

Alright, what's the difference. What are we gonna do now? He won't take our calls, we can't get into his office... 

JERRY

You know what we could do? He eats at that restaurant, Pfeiffer's? We could have Gail call us, tell us the next time he's there, go there and talk to him. 

GEORGE

Hey, now you're onto something. 

JERRY

The whole thing is so stupid. Like he wouldn't do the same thing if Elaine walked by in a low-cut dress. 

GEORGE

Yeah. Well, maybe not Elaine. 

JERRY

No. 

GEORGE

But...somebody like Gail, though. 

JERRY

Ya. 

ELAINE

What? What do you mean, Gail? (Kramer enters.) 

KRAMER

Yah-hey. 

JERRY

Kramer, listen, I want you to ask Gail to do me a favor. The next time Russell Dalrymple comes in the restaurant, ask her if she would call me. 

KRAMER

Alright, I'll call her right now. 

JERRY

Ok. (Kramer goes back to his apartment.) 

ELAINE

What do you mean, Gail? You don't think I can attract attention? You don't think I can put asses in the seats? 

JERRY

Look, sweetheart, you know you've got it all. But let's face it... (Kramer comes back.) 

KRAMER

She said she'll do it. 

GEORGE

Beautiful. 

JERRY

Beautiful. 

KRAMER

But she wants the shoes. 

ELAINE

What? 

KRAMER

She says she wants those shoes. 

ELAINE

She wants my shoes? What kind of person is this? Alright! She is not getting 'em! 

JERRY

No, come on! I'll buy you another pair! 

ELAINE

No, these were the last pair of these that they had! 

JERRY

I'll get you another one just like it! 

ELAINE

No, but these were the only really cool ones like this! Don't you see how everybody likes 'em and how everybody talks about 'em? (Jerry, realizing Elaine's motivation, sits at the counter unbelievingly.) 

GEORGE

Elaine, this pilot...it doesn't matter to me, it's not me I'm concerned about...it's my mother. I've been over to the hospital to see her... 

ELAINE

Oh yeah, because she caught you jer - 

GEORGE

Never mind! 

ELAINE

Oh, come on, wait a second, this whole thing is ridiculous. How do I even know she wears the same size? 

KRAMER

Alright, what size are you? 

ELAINE

Seven-and-a-half. 

KRAMER

Eh! Bingo. 

GAIL

Sauce this. (Goes to the telephone and dials.) Yeah, he's here. Oh, and one more thing...bring the shoes. (Hangs up.) 

JERRY

Hey! Whattaya know! 

GEORGE

Look who's here! 

JERRY

Fancy meeting you here! 

RUSSELL

Oh. Hello. 

GEORGE

Pasta primavera! Back on the horse. 

JERRY

You know, it's a funny thing, because after the pilot got cancelled, we hadn't heard from you. 

GEORGE

Didn't hear anything... 

JERRY

Didn't know...we were wondering...what happened. 

RUSSELL

Well, it just didn't seem to be the right project for us right now. (Elaine walks by in a low-cut dress. Jerry and George look at her as she moves to the table opposite Russell.) So, what were you saying? 

GEORGE

Oh...uh, because if it had anything at all to do with what you perceived as me leering at your daughter, I really have to take issue with that. I did not leer. (To Jerry) Did I leer? 

JERRY

No leer. (Elaine comes over to Russell's table.) 

ELAINE

Uh, excuse me, are you using that ketchup? 

RUSSELL

Uh, no. (Elaine takes the ketchup and goes back to her table.) 

GEORGE

Because, if I'm looking straight ahead, and something enters my field of vision, that's merely a happenstance. (Elaine loudly snaps and unfolds her napkin at the next table to get Russell's attention.) 

RUSSELL

Under the circumstances, I don't really feel that we should be in business together. (Elaine comes back over.) 

ELAINE

Here's your ketchup back. You know, I had the hardest time trying to get some out. I mean, I just kept pounding and pounding on the bottom of it. Do you have any trouble? 

RUSSELL

No. 

ELAINE

Do you have a...ketchup secret? 

RUSSELL

No, I... (finally notices Elaine)...don't have a ketchup secret. (Smiles.) 

ELAINE

Because if you do have a ketchup secret, I would really, really like to know what it is. (Russell is pleased, and smiles at Elaine. Elaine goes back to her table, sits down, and waves at Russell.) 

RUSSELL

Field of vision, huh? 

GAIL

How's everything? 

ELAINE

Mmmm. 

JERRY

Really good. 

GEORGE

This pasta primavera is fabulous. 

JERRY

Very tasty. 

GAIL

How'd everything go with that NBC guy? 

GEORGE

Great. 

JERRY

The pilot's back on. In fact, Elaine's going out with him tomorrow night. (Gail nods and walks away.) Listen, Elaine, you know if Russell mentions anything about the pilot, you'll of course tell him how much you liked it...? 

ELAINE

You know, I happen to have the script right here with me and, uh...on page 3, for example, suppose the Elaine character comes in wearing a...a low-cut dress. And the butler is very distracted, and can't work. 

JERRY

Uh...that kind of comedy, that's a little broad for us. 

ELAINE

Well, I'm sure it's right up Russell's alley. 

GEORGE

Well, it's a funny idea. 

JERRY

It's funny! 

GEORGE

C'mon, funny is funny. 

JERRY

Funny is funny, we're here to entertain, right? 

ELAINE

Alright, well, maybe I'll mention it to Russell tomorrow night. 

JERRY

If you can. 

GEORGE

Yeah. Where's he taking you, by the way? 

ELAINE

Bouchard's, on 53rd. (George starts choking on his wine, and attempts to tell Elaine something.) 

JERRY

I think what he's trying to say is, 'get the bouilla-base.' (George nods 'yes' and continues to choke.) 

ALLISON

I don't want to *live*! I don't want to *live*! 

GEORGE

Because of me? You must be joking! Who wouldn't want to live because of me? I'm nothing! 

ALLISON

No... You're *something*. 

GEORGE

You can do better than me. You could throw a dart out the window and hit someone better than me. I'm no good! 

ALLISON

You're good. You're *good*! 

GEORGE

I'm bad. I'm *bad*! 

ALLISON

You're *killing* me! 

GEORGE

So what could I do? I couldn't go through with it. She threatened to kill herself. 

ELAINE

Over you? 

GEORGE

Yes. Why, is that so inconceivable? 

GEORGE

I got two tickets to see 'Guys And Dolls'. 

ELAINE

I got him a two-line phone. 

JERRY

Unbelievable! She's not there. 

GEORGE

What paper does she write for? 

JERRY

The works for the NYU school newspaper. She's a grad student in journalism. Never been to a comedy club. Never even seen me, has no idea who I am. 

ELAINE

Never even seen you? Gotta kinda envy that... 

JERRY

Y'know, you've been developing quite the acid-tongue lately... 

ELAINE

[Proudly] Really? 

ELAINE

Hey, who do you think is the most unattractive world leader? 

JERRY

Living or all time? 

ELAINE

All time. 

JERRY

Well, if it's all time, then there's no contest. It begins and ends with Brezhnev. 

ELAINE

I dunno. You ever get a good look at DeGaulle? 

GEORGE

Lyndon Johnson was uglier than Degaulle. 

ELAINE

I got news for you. Golda Meir could make 'em all run up a tree. 

ELAINE

Y'know, just because you two are homosexuals, so what? I mean you should just come out of the closet and be openly gay already. 

GEORGE

So, whaddya say? You know you'll always be the only man I'll ever love. 

JERRY

[indignantly] What's the matter with you? 

GEORGE

[quietly] C'mon, go along... 

JERRY

I'm not goin' along. I can just see you in Berlin in 1939 goose- stepping past me: 'C'mon Jerry, go along, go along...' 

JERRY

Y'know I hear that all the time. 

ELAINE

Hear what? 

JERRY

That I'm gay. People think I'm gay. 

ELAINE

Yeah, you know people ask me that about you, too. 

JERRY

Yeah, 'cuz I'm single, I'm thin and I'm neat. 

ELAINE

And you get along well with women. 

GEORGE

I guess that leaves me in the clear... 

GEORGE

I just thought of a great name for myself, if I ever become a porno actor. 

JERRY

Oh yeah, what? 'Buck Naked'? 

GEORGE

Yeah, how did you know that? 

JERRY

You told me that already like two months ago. 

GEORGE

Allison bought it for me. 

JERRY

How you gonna get out of *that* one? 

GEORGE

I dunno. I guess I have to wait for her to die. 

JERRY

He's gonna hang around if that's alright with you? 

SHARON

Sure, I'd like to talk to him, too. 

GEORGE

Jerry did you wash this pear? 

JERRY

Yeah, I washed it. 

GEORGE

It looks like it hasn't been washed. 

JERRY

So *wash* *it*. 

GEORGE

You hear the way he talks to me? 

SHARON

You should hear how *my* boyfriend talks to me... 

GEORGE

Let me ask you something. What do you think of this shirt? 

SHARON

It's nice. 

GEORGE

Jerry said he didn't like it. 

JERRY

I didn't say I didn't like it. I said it was O.K... 

GEORGE

No, you said you didn't like it... 

JERRY

Oh, so what if I don't like it. Is that like the end of the world, or something? 

SHARON

So how did you two meet? 

JERRY

Actually, we met in the gym locker room. 

GEORGE

Yeah. Actually it was in gym class. I was trying to climb the ropes and Jerry was spotting me. I kept slipping and burning my thighs and then finally I slipped and fell on Jerry's head. We've been close ever since. 

SHARON

Do you guys live together? 

JERRY

[quizzically] Live together? 

GEORGE

No, I got my own place. 

SHARON

And do your parents know? 

JERRY

Know *what*? 

GEORGE

My parents? They don't know *what's* goin' on... 

JERRY

Oh God, you're that girl in the coffee shop that was eavesdropping on us. I *knew* you looked familiar! 

JERRY

There's been a big misunderstanding here! We did that whole thing for your benefit. We knew you were eavesdropping. That's why my friend said all that. It was on purpose! We're not gay! Not that there's anything wrong with that... 

GEORGE

No, of course not... 

JERRY

I mean that's fine if that's who you are... 

GEORGE

Absolutely... 

JERRY

I mean I have many gay friends... 

GEORGE

My *father* is gay... 

SHARON

Look, I know what I heard. 

JERRY

It was a *joke*... 

GEORGE

Look, you wanna have sex right now? Do want to have sex with me right now? Let's go! C'mon, let's go baby! C'mon! 

KRAMER

Hey, C'mon! Let's go! I thought we were going to take a steam! 

GEORGE

No! 

JERRY

No steam! 

KRAMER

Well I don't want to sit there naked all by myself! 

KRAMER

Happy birthday paruba! 

JERRY

Today's not my birthday. 

KRAMER

Well, I beg to differ... 

JERRY

Look at this! A phone! A two-line phone! 

JERRY

Hey, where you going? 

ELAINE

I gotta go return something... 

SHARON

Jerry, it's Sharon from NYU. I'm just calling to tell you that I'm not going to play up that angle we talked about and I'm sorry. 

JERRY

Thank you very much, that's great- >click< Oh! Hold on a sec, I got a call on the other line. >click click< Hello? 

GEORGE

Hey. 

JERRY

Hey, how ya doin'? Y'know I got that reporter from the newspaper on the other line. 

GEORGE

So, what did she say? 

JERRY

She says she's not going to play up that angle of the story. She thinks we're heterosexual. [sarcastically] I guess we *fooled* her. I'll get rid of her, hold on... >click click< Sharon? Hello? Sharon, are you there? >click click< I'm back... 

GEORGE

Y'know... I could hear you on the other line... 

JERRY

What are you talkin' about? 

GEORGE

I heard what you said: 'Sharon, are you there?'. 

JERRY

You heard me talkin' on the other line, are you sure? 

GEORGE

Yes, I heard you! 

JERRY

Well, maybe she was disconnected. 

GEORGE

Maybe she wasn't! Maybe she heard the whole conversation! 

JERRY

Alright, hang on. Let me call Kramer and see if you can hear anything, hold on. >click click click<... 

KRAMER

Yello? 

JERRY

Kramer, there may be a problem with the phone, hold on. >click click< 

GEORGE

'There may be a problem with the phone, hold on'! 

JERRY

Oh no! >click click< Kramer, this phone's a piece of junk, goodbye! 

GEORGE

'The phone's a piece of junk, goodbye'! 

JERRY

Oh no! Now she's heard everything! What are we gonna do?!? 

GEORGE

Now she thinks we're gay, not that there's anything wrong with it... 

JERRY

No, no, of course not! People's personal sexual preferences are nobody's business but their own! 

SHARON

Why don't you take a seat? 

ELAINE

Thank-you. 

SHARON

Why don't you take your coat off? 

ELAINE

So she kept insisting I take off my coat. I refused, and then she forcibly tried to get me to remove it. 

JERRY

She wouldn't take her coat off at my house, either. 

GEORGE

Y'know there are tribes in Indonesia where if you keep your coat on in somebody's house, the families go to war! 

JERRY

So you don't take your coat off, and now everyone at NYU thinks I'm gay. Not that there's anything wrong with that... 

GEORGE

Not at all. 

GEORGE

Two tickets to 'Guys And Dolls'! I'm gonna go with you! 

JERRY

'Guys And Dolls'? Isn't that a lavish, Broadway musical? 

GEORGE

It's 'Guys And *Dolls*', not 'Guys And *Guys*'. 

JERRY

'The Collected Works Of Bette Midler'. 

JERRY

What do you got there? 

JERRY

'Although they maintain separate residences, the comedian and his long-time *companion* seem to be inseparable...' Oh no! The Associated Press picked up the NYU story. That's going to be in every paper! I've been 'outed'! I wasn't even 'in'! 

GEORGE

Now everyone's going to think we're gay! 

JERRY

Not that there's anything wrong with that... 

GEORGE

No, not at all... 

JERRY

'Within the confines of his fastidious bachelor *pad*, Seinfeld and Costanza bicker over the cleanliness of a piece of *fruit* like an old married couple--' *I told you that pear was washed*! 

KRAMER

I thought we were friends... 

JERRY

Here we go... 

KRAMER

I mean, how could you two keep this a secret from me? 

JERRY

It's not true! 

KRAMER

Aaaah! Enough lying! The lying is through! C'mon, Jerry, the masquerade is over. You're thin, late thirties, single... 

JERRY

So are you... 

KRAMER

Yeah-- 

GEORGE

Hello? 

S

George? 

GEORGE

Mrs. Seinfeld?!? 

S

Oh, my God... 

JERRY

Oh, my God! [takes the phone] Ma? 

S

Jerry? 

JERRY

Ma! 

GEORGE

Oh, my God! My *MOTHER*!!! 

S

Jerry? 

JERRY

Ma, it's not true! 

S

It's those damn culottes you made him wear when he was five! 

S

They weren't culottes, they were shorts. 

S

They were culottes! You bought them in the girl's department. 

S

By mistake! By mistake, Jerry! I'm sorry! 

S

It looked like he was wearing a skirt, for crying out loud! 

JERRY

Ma, it has nothing to do with the culottes! 

S

Not that there's anything wrong with that, Jerry. 

C

I open up the paper, and *this* is what I have to read about? I fell right off the toilet. My back went out again, I couldn't move... The super had to come and get help me up. I was half naked! 

GEORGE

It's *not* *true*! 

C

Every *day* it's something else with you. I don't know anything about you any more. Who are you? What kind of life are you leading? Who knows *what* you're doing? Maybe you're making porno films. 

GEORGE

Yeah. I'm Buck Naked. 

C

Jerry, I can see. He's so neat and thin. Not that there's anything wrong with it. 

GEORGE

Of course not... 

NURSE

6:30, Scott. Time for your sponge bath. 

GEORGE

Alright, now the play is tomorrow night. So do you want to have dinner first, or do you just want to meet at the theatre? 

SAILOR

Excuse me, sir? I don't mean to bother you. I just wanted you to know that it took a lot of guts to come out the way you did, and that you've inspired me to do the same, even though that may mean a discharge from the service. Thanks. 

JERRY

Y'know, I think I'll pass on the 'Guys And Dolls'... 

GEORGE

No. Just imagine her reaction. 

ELAINE

Yeah... 

GEORGE

Oh, my God... 

JERRY

What? 

GEORGE

She hasn't seen the article! When she sees it, she's gonna think-- *I'm out baby*!! I'm out!!!!! 

ALLISON

Yeah? So? 

GEORGE

Yeah so?? 

ALLISON

Well this is nice. They mention your name. 

GEORGE

Don't you see what it says here? Don't you understand what that's implying? 

ALLISON

No, what? 

GEORGE

I'm gay! I'm a gay man! I'm very, very gay. 

ALLISON

You're *gay*? 

GEORGE

Extraordinarily gay. Steeped in gayness. 

ALLISON

[matter-of-factly] I don't believe it. 

GEORGE

You don't believe me? Ask Jerry. 

ALLISON

I will. 

GEORGE

What do you mean you will? That's a bad idea. Jerry is a very private person. 

ALLISON

[Grabs George's lapels] I want to hear it from *Jerry*... 

SHARON

Oh, can you ever forgive me? 

JERRY

I dunno... [they kiss again] *Alright*, I forgive you... 

SHARON

Y'know the funny thing is, I was attracted to you immediately. 

JERRY

I was attracted to you, too. You remind me of Lois Lane. 

GEORGE

Jerry! Oh, my God! What are you doing!?! 

JERRY

What!? 

GEORGE

You're with a *woman*! 

JERRY

I know! What are you doin' here?!? 

GEORGE

I leave you alone for two seconds, and this is what you do! I trusted you! 

JERRY

[forcibly removing G. from the apt] Would you get the Hell out of here! 

SHARON

What's going on? 

ALLISON

Yeah, what's going on? 

GEORGE

Alright, tell her. Go ahead. 

JERRY

Tell her what? 

GEORGE

Y'know. About *us*. 

GEORGE

Alright, I'll tell you the truth. I'm not gay. My name's Buck Naked, I'm a porno actor. 

ALLISON

*Really*? 

KRAMER

We'll see you later... 

KRAMER

He's the *phone* man! 

KRAMER

Not that there's anything wrong with that... 

GEORGE

Oh, what's the point? When I like them, they don't like me, when they like me, I don't like them. Why can't I act with the ones I like the same way I do with the ones I don't like? 

JERRY

Well, you've only got another fifty years or so to go before it'll *all* be over... 

GEORGE

Maybe I need someone who doesn't speak English. 

JERRY

Yeah, how about a mute? 

GEORGE

A mute would be good. 

JERRY

Ah, where you gonna meet a mute? 

GEORGE

This is what my life has come to... Tryin to meet a mute. 

GEORGE

I dunno, Jerry somethin's missing. There's a void, Jerry, there's a void... 

JERRY

A deep, yawning chasm... 

GEORGE

There's gotta be more to life than this. What gives you pleasure? 

JERRY

Listening to you. I listen to this for fifteen minutes and I'm on top of the world. Your misery is my pleasure. 

ELAINE

Hey boys! 

JERRY

Hey! How you doin'? 

ELAINE

Good. Okay, well, it's all set. I start tomorrow. 

GEORGE

Start what? 

ELAINE

I signed up to do volunteer work with senior citizens. 

GEORGE

*Really*. 

ELAINE

Yeah. God, I can't tell you how I feel! I mean, I feel *so* *good*! I *really* feel good. The strange thing is, I mean, I haven't even met the woman yet. 

GEORGE

Volunteer work, huh? 

JERRY

What're you gonna do down there? 

ELAINE

Well, they say all it is is that you go over to their apartment and, I dunno, you take them for a walk and you get a cup of coffee and it's supposed to make them feel good. 

JERRY

That's what I do with him [points at George] 

GEORGE

When did you get this idea? 

ELAINE

Last time I had lunch with you here. You were going *on* and *on* and *on* about how you wanted to meet somebody who didn't speak English. 

JERRY

What, do you break it in with her, then you try it out on me? 

GEORGE

And... and anybody can do this? 

ELAINE

Yup. 

GEORGE

Helping people... Of course. Of course! It makes perfect sense! How could I *not* be doing this!? I am gonna help somebody, Dammit! 

ELAINE

[To Jerry] What about you? 

JERRY

Nah, it's not for me. 

ELAINE

Jerry, if anybody should be doing this, it's you. 

GEORGE

What *kind* of a person are you? 

JERRY

I think I'm pretty much like you-- only successful. 

REP

This is a wonderful thing you're doing. They're so grateful just to have someone to talk to. And I can tell you that everyone who participates finds the experience extremely rewarding. 

GEORGE

Well, I feel better already. I'm feelin' like a good person. 

REP

Good luck. 

JERRY

Thank you. 

GEORGE

Hey, what's your guy's name again? 

JERRY

Fields. Sidney Fields. *87* years old. *87*. How about your guy? 

GEORGE

Ben Cantwell. 85. Huh... You think we'll make it to that age? 

JERRY

*We*? No. 

KRAMER

So what's up, Diggity Dog? 

JERRY

George and I just signed up with the Senior Citizen's Volunteer Agency. Same thing Elaine's doing. 

KRAMER

Oh, that's too bad. Now don't say I didn't try to warn you. 

JERRY

What're you talkin' about? 

KRAMER

Oh, Jerry, I'm *surprised* at you! 

JERRY

What? 

KRAMER

It's a *con*. These agencies are usually a front for some money laundering scheme. Or they're bunko artists; bilkin' people out of their life savings, oh *yeah*. 

JERRY

Where do you *get* this? 

KRAMER

The alternative media, Jerry. That's where you hear the truth. 

NEWMAN

Kramer?! Kramer!? Where are you? Kramer!?! Kramer!!? 

KRAMER

I'm in here. C'mon... 

JERRY

Hello, *Newman*... 

NEWMAN

Jerry, George. [To Kramer] So, did you ask him about the records? 

KRAMER

Well-- 

JERRY

What records? 

KRAMER

Well, Newman and I are going partners selling used records. 

NEWMAN

You know Ron's Records down on Bleeker? They pay big cash for used records! 

KRAMER

Yeah, so we thought if you had any of those big, y'know, old-fashioned useless records, y'know, just... lyin' around-- 

KRAMER

Y'know, we'd take them off your hands, free of charge. 

GEORGE

Let me ask you something. What do you do for a living, Newman? 

NEWMAN

I'm a United States postal worker. 

GEORGE

Aren't those the guys that always go crazy and come back with a gun and shoot everybody? 

NEWMAN

Sometimes... 

JERRY

Why *is* that? 

NEWMAN

Because the mail never stops. It just keeps coming and coming and coming, there's never a let-up. It's relentless. Every day it piles up more and more and more! And you gotta get it out but the more you get it out the more it keeps coming in. And then the bar code reader breaks and it's *Publisher's Clearing House* day!!! 

RON

I'll give you five bucks. 

KRAMER

Five bucks??? 

NEWMAN

Well, you know how much those records are worth!? 

RON

Yeah, I do... Fi' dollars. 

NEWMAN

Those records are worth more than five dollars! 

KRAMER

[In Newman's ear] He's gyppin' us... 

NEWMAN

You're gyppin' us! 

RON

Well, whattya got here, y'know, you got 'Don Ho: Live At Honolulu', you got 'Jerry Vale Sings Italian Love Songs' you got Sergio Mendes, now come on... 

KRAMER

Wait, wait, wait... Sergio Mendes has a cult following. 

NEWMAN

They follow him like a cult. 

KRAMER

He can't even walk down the street in South America... 

RON

Look, that's his problem, alright? Now you don't like it, too bad. 

KRAMER

[In Newman's ear] I don't like it... 

NEWMAN

I don't like it. 

RON

Well, then get the Hell out of my store, alright? You bring me something decent, I'll give you some money. 

KRAMER

[In Newman's ear] Alright, well be back, jack. 

NEWMAN

Alright, well be back... *jack*! 

JERRY

Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld, the agency sent me. 

HOUSEKEEPER

Agency? 

JERRY

Yeah, is this Sid Field's residence? 

HOUSEKEEPER

Sid Fields. 

SID

What the *Hell* is it? 

JERRY

Mr. Fields? 

SID

What!?! 

JERRY

Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld, the agency sent me. 

SID

Agency? What agency? The *CIA*? 

JERRY

No, no, the-- 

SID

Who let you in here? 

JERRY

The woman, she-- 

SID

Oh *her*. She *steals* from me. Steals my money. She says she doesn't speak English. My *ass* she doesn't speak English. Plays that freakin' 'voo-doo' music, tries to hypnotize me. She thinks she's gonna turn me into a zombie and then rob me blind. Well, I wasn't born yesterday. I may drop dead today, but I sure as Hell wasn't born yesterday. Now get the Hell out of my house... 

JERRY

Mr. Fields, I'm here to spend some time with you. 

SID

Oh, really. Are you the boyfriend? I know she's got a boyfriend. Are you going to *kill* me? I'm an old man for crying out loud, you gonna kill an old man, you coward?!? [Jerry gets out card] 

JERRY

No, Mr. Field, look, really I'm-- 

SID

I can't read that you fool... 

JERRY

What's all this stuff? 

SID

Trash. Garbage. 

JERRY

You're throwin' this out?? 

SID

I believe that's what you do with garbage, you idiot. 

JERRY

You don't want any of this? 

SID

Well if I wanted it I wouldn't be throwing it away, *Ein-stein*. 

JERRY

You know I have some friends who would really like to have these. 

SID

Well, take it. I'm sure as Hell not going to give it to my family. 

JERRY

Well, do you want to go out for a walk, get a cup of coffee... 

SID

With you? I'd rather be dead. 

JERRY

Well, maybe I'll get goin' then. I just remembered I got an appointment to get my, um, tonsils out. 

SID

Good. Thank God. Good riddance. [pause] Oh listen, before you go, would you mind changing my diaper? HAA!! 

BEN

No, I feel great for 85. 

GEORGE

Y'know the average life span for an American male is like, 72. You're really... kinda pushin' the envelope there. 

BEN

I'm not afraid of dyin'. I never think about it. 

GEORGE

You don't? Boy, I think about it a lot. I think about it at my age. Imagine how much I'll be thinkin' about it at your age. All I'll do is keep thinkin' about it until it drives me insane... 

BEN

I'm grateful for every moment I have. 

GEORGE

Grateful? How can you be grateful when you're *so* close to the end? When you know that any second-- Poof! Bamm-O! It can all be over. I mean you're not stupid, you can read the handwriting on the wall. It's a matter of simple arithmetic, for Gods sake... 

BEN

I guess I just don't care. 

GEORGE

What are you talking about? How can you sit there and look me in the eye and tell that me you're not worried?! Don't you have any *sense*?!! Don't you have a brain!? Are you so completely senile that you don't know what you're talkin about Anymore!!?! 

GEORGE

Wait a second, where are you going? 

BEN

Life's too short to waste on you. 

GEORGE

Wait a minute, please-- 

BEN

Get out of my way... 

GEORGE

But Mr. Cantwell, you... you owe me for the soup... 

ELAINE

Mrs. Oliver? 

O

Yes my dear. 

ELAINE

Ooh! 

O

What's the trouble? Are you alright? 

ELAINE

Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. 

O

It's my goiter, isn't it? 

ELAINE

Did you say goiter? What goiter? 

O

This football-shaped lump jutting out the side of my neck. 

ELAINE

Oh, *that* goiter. Hey... Heh heh heh... Whaddya know... 

O

Does it bother you? 

ELAINE

Bother me? Oh, phhbt... Why would a little goiter like that bother me? No, not a bit. It's nothing. It's nothin', it's um, in fact, it's um, it's very distinctive, y'know? Um, I mean you want to know something? I, I wish I had one. [pause] Really. 

JERRY

C'mon Elaine, it's just a goiter... 

ELAINE

I don't know what I'm going to do. I can't look the woman in the face. I mean I keep thinkin' that that goiter's gonna start talkin' to me... You'd think they'd mention that before they send you over there: 'Oh, by the way, this woman *almost* has a second head'. But no, no, I didn't get any goiter information. 

JERRY

They really should mention that in the breakdown: height, weight, goiter. 

ELAINE

Y'know you try to do some good. You want to be a good person but this is too much to ask. 

JERRY

Yeah, well, I'll tell ya, I'd rather talk to a goiter with a nice disposition than the nut they sent me to. 

ELAINE

Hey Georgie, what happened with your guy? 

GEORGE

I don't think it's gonna work out... 

JERRY

Whattya mean? 

GEORGE

He fired me. 

JERRY

He fired you?!? 

ELAINE

*How* do you get fired from a volunteer job? 

GEORGE

I dunno. I was just talking to the man and he walked out on me! 

JERRY

Well, I dunno about you two, but I'm quitting. I hate my guy. He's a mean, mean guy. 

ELAINE

I wish I could quit... 

JERRY

So quit! 

GEORGE

Yeah, I'm a great quitter. It's one of the few things I do well. I come form a long line of quitters. My father was a quitter, my grandfather was a quitter... I was raised to give up. 

KRAMER

Well, here's your *albums* [Journey 'Escape' is on top, BTW...] 

JERRY

What happened? 

NEWMAN

Five dollars. He offered us *five* dollars. 

KRAMER

Hey, what kind of stuff are you listening to? You *embarrassed* me at that store. 

NEWMAN

That guy thought we were a couple of total squares. 

JERRY

Oh yeah, you and your *Sergio Mendes*... 

KRAMER

Hey, hey, hey, hey, that guy can't even go to the bathroom in South America! 

JERRY

Well you shoulda seen the pile of albums this old guy I was visiting today was throwing away: Sinatra, Duke Ellington, Al Jolson, Benny Goodman... 

KRAMER

Wait, wait, wait, now... He's throwin them out?? 

JERRY

Yeah, and then I asked him if my friend could have them and he said yeah. 

KRAMER

Okay... 

NEWMAN

[In Kramer's ear] The old coot's sittin' on a mountain of gold! 

KRAMER

Yeah... 

JERRY

But you're going to have to go get em. I'm not carryin' them all. 

KRAMER

Yeah, but you've gotta come with us. 

JERRY

Yeah, I'm goin' there today. In fact you should see this house keeper he's got. She's from Senegal [and, ala Carson] Wild, Wild, Stuff... 

GEORGE

Senegal? 

GEORGE

So you don't speak *any* English at all? 

HOUSEKEEPER

English? No. 

SID

Hey, what are those bums doin' back there? 

JERRY

Well you said they could come and take the records. 

SID

It's like watchin' a couple of hyenas goin' through the garbage. 

GEORGE

You don't speak *any* English? 

HOUSEKEEPER

No English. 

GEORGE

I would like to dip my bald head in oil and rub it all over your body. [No reaction] You don't understand! It's a miracle! You don't understand because you don't speak English! 

JERRY

So Mr. Fields I just don't know if this arrangement is-- 

SID

Hey, I don't like what's goin' on around here. I want all you bums outta here. 

KRAMER

Now calm down, Mr. Fields... 

SID

Now don't tell me to calm down... Get your hands off of me! Why you little... 

KRAMER

Oooow! He's biting me! 

SID

My teeth! My teeth! 

JERRY

Where's his teeth! Where's his teeth! 

GEORGE

I thought I saw something fly over here... 

JERRY

Well turn the light on... 

JERRY

That's the garbage disposal! 

SID

My teeth! You idiots!!! 

O

And we would take long automobile trips-- 

ELAINE

Oh, well, that sounds like a lot of fun... 

O

Staring out the window-- 

ELAINE

Uh huh... 

O

You'd see a long view of rolling pastures and-- 

ELAINE

Well, that'll get you goin' right there... 

O

Big, roaming cows-- 

ELAINE

Cows, well that's fascinating... 

O

That's when I began my affair with Mohandas. 

ELAINE

What? 

O

Mohandas. 

ELAINE

Ghandhi? 

O

Oh, the *passion*. The *forbidden pleasure*-- 

ELAINE

You had an affair with Ghandhi? MRS. O: He used to dip his bald head in oil and rub it all over my body. Here, look... [shows Elaine a picture of the two together] 

ELAINE

Oh, my God... The Mohatma? 

RON

Twenty bucks. 

NEWMAN

Twenty bucks?!? Are you out of your mind? 

RON

Well, take it or leave it. 

NEWMAN

Take it or leave it!? We got *Al Jolson* here, *Al Jolson*!! 

RON

Now what the Hell do I care about Al Jolson. I'd just assume her you sing 'Mammy'. Heh heh heh... 

KRAMER

[In Newman's ear] This guy's nothin' but a piece of crap... 

NEWMAN

You are nothing but a piece of crap. 

RON

Pardon me? 

KRAMER

[In Newman's ear] A piece of crap... 

NEWMAN

A piece of crap. 

KRAMER

[In Newman's ear] I find you extremely ugly... 

NEWMAN

I find you extremely ugly. 

RON

*Do* you? 

KRAMER

[In Newman's ear] You emit a foul and unpleasant odour... 

NEWMAN

You emit a foul and unpleasant odour. 

RON

Oh, is that right? 

KRAMER

[In Newman's ear] I *loathe* you... 

NEWMAN

I *loathe* you. 

RON

That's it. Get out of my store! 

KRAMER

[In Newman's ear] Make us. 

NEWMAN

Make us! 

RON

Oh, I'll make you! 

REP

Do you realize how irresponsible this is? Our agency's sole purpose is to care for senior citizens. And in one fell swoop you've single- handedly destroyed our reputation. 

JERRY

Yes, but-- 

JERRY

[Into intercom] Yes? 

TIM

It's Tim Fields, Mr. Fields' son. 

JERRY

Alright, c'mon up. 

JERRY

[To Rep] I dunno what happened, we were just trying to take him to the dentist. 

REP

Why were you taking him to the dentist? 

JERRY

Um, well, his false teeth got mangled up in the garbage disposal-- 

REP

What were his false teeth doing in the garbage disposal? 

JERRY

Well, after he bit my friend-- 

REP

Bit your friend?! 

TIM

What the *Hell* is going on here? How do you *lose* a human being?! 

JERRY

I, I'm sorry. 

TIM

And who were these other people. What were they doing in the apartment!? 

JERRY

Well, I brought them up there to take his records-- 

TIM

Take his *records*? Do you realize how valuable that record collection is? 

KRAMER

Hey. 

JERRY

There you are. Did you find him? 

KRAMER

No, y'know we took the old man's records over to Ron's and he tried to *screw* us so we got in a fight. 

NEWMAN

It was a real melee. 

KRAMER

Yeah, a real brouhaha... 

SIDRA

Oh, hi Jerry. 

JERRY

Hi, Sidra. I usually last about ten minutes on a Stairmaster. Unless of course there's someone stretching in front of me in a leotard, then I can go an hour. 

SIDRA

Really. 

JERRY

Oh, yeah. That's why they call it a Stairmaster. You get up there and you stare. 

SIDRA

Well, I'm done. I think I'm gonna go take a sauna. 

JERRY

Alright, I'll see you Thursday night, right? 

SIDRA

Thursday night. 

JERRY

Alright. 

ELAINE

Good workout? 

JERRY

Tremendous workout. 

ELAINE

That's a pretty girl. 

JERRY

Tremendous girl. 

ELAINE

She's the one you went out with last night? 

JERRY

Yeah. I really like her. 

ELAINE

You know, uh...they're fake. 

JERRY

What? Don't say that! 

ELAINE

Nah! They're fake! 

JERRY

How do you know? 

ELAINE

I can tell. You know how you're always bragging how you can spot a lesbian? 

JERRY

I'm not bragging, I happen to have a very keen lesbian eye. (A woman walks by Jerry and Elaine.) Hi, how ya doin.' (Jerry jerks a thumb at the woman to confirm his talent. Elaine is skeptical.) 

ELAINE

Oh, right. C'mon, don't you think they seem a bit too perfect? 

JERRY

Yes, they do! 

ELAINE

I never knew you were so into breasts. I thought you were a leg man. 

JERRY

A leg man? Why would I be a leg man? I don't need legs. I have legs. Have you ever seen her naked in the locker room? 

ELAINE

No. 

JERRY

Oh, well, then I can't accept your testimony. Maybe if you had seen her naked. 

ELAINE

I don't want to see her naked. 

JERRY

Well, I do. 

ELAINE

Well, that's your problem. 

JERRY

Look, you made the allegation. The least you could do is follow up. 

ELAINE

Jerry, what am I gonna do? I'm gonna go in there and spy on her in the sauna? 

JERRY

Yes! Go in there! Do a little investigative journalism. I need to know! 

ELAINE

But a few more dates and you can find out for yourself! 

JERRY

Don't be so sure. Look at George - he's on his ninth date with Betsy, he still hasn't gotten anywhere with her. 

ELAINE

What's his problem? 

JERRY

Well, every time he tries to make a move, something screws up. Like on their last date, they were on the couch, but she was sitting on his wrong side. 

ELAINE

Wrong side? 

JERRY

Yeah, she was on his right side. He can't make a move with his left hand. Can't go left. 

ELAINE

He can't go left. 

JERRY

No! I'm lefty, can't go right. What about women? Do they go left or right? 

ELAINE

Nah, we just play defense. 

GEORGE

Can I ask you a question? Would you mind switching seats? 

BETSY

Oh, actually, I really prefer to sit here. I don't hear very well out of this ear (points to her right ear) so, I always try to sit to the right of people. 

GEORGE

I'll shout. 

BETSY

Well, I really think I feel more comfortable here. 

GEORGE

C'mon, c'mon...(stands up and physically rolls Betsy to the left side of the couch.) See, now, is that so bad? 

BETSY

What? (The phone rings.) 

GEORGE

No, no, the machine'll get it... 

BETSY

No, no, it's not on... 

GEORGE

They'll call back. 

BETSY

But George, what if it's an emergency? 

GEORGE

In the whole world right now, there's maybe three emergencies. Why would you think, on this entire planet, that you're one of those three? 

BETSY

George, please. (Gets up and answers the phone.) Hello? What? (shocked) Oh my god! 

GEORGE

Alright, maybe four. 

BETSY

So, when's the funeral? Well, Aunt Clarice was so ill, I guess it was really a blessing. (George, on the couch behind Betsy, is impatiently waiting for her to get off the phone so he can continue putting the moves on her. He shrugs, and crosses himself.) Yeah, I'll fly home as soon as I can. (George waves goodbye, and mimics a plane flying through the air with his hand.) O.k. You, too. Get some sleep. (Betsy looks at George, and he manufactures a completely phony look of sorrow.) 

JERRY

You're sure? 

ELAINE

Positive! This chick's playin' with confederate money. 

JERRY

Well then, that's it. That's the end of that. 

ELAINE

What? Just 'cause of that? 

JERRY

Just 'cause of that? It's like finding out Mickey Mantle corked his bat! 

ELAINE

Oh, come on! You've dated women with nosejobs, what's the difference? 

JERRY

You don't touch the nose! You don't aspire to reach the nose. You don't unhook anything to get to a nose, and no man has ever tried to look up a woman's nostril. 

ELAINE

You've put a lot of thought into this, haven't you? 

JERRY

Well, I take it very seriously. 

ELAINE

You know, sometimes when I think you're the shallowest man I've ever met, you somehow manage to drain a little more out of the pool. 

KRAMER

Hey. 

JERRY

Hey. You know, I do kinda wonder what fake breast feel like. 

KRAMER

Well, I know what they feel like. 

JERRY

You? How do you know? 

KRAMER

Well, I lived in Los Angeles for three months. 

ELAINE

I thought you hated Los Angeles. 

KRAMER

I do! I just miss the warm weather, y'know? Jeez. Oh man, I wish I could get away. 

JERRY

Real busy now down at the office? 

KRAMER

No. Huh? You know who I saw at the health club? Salman Rushdie. 

ELAINE

Yeah right, Salman Rushdie. Yeah well, I can see that - you got five millions Moslems after you, you wanna stay in pretty good shape. 

GEORGE

I know what the problem is - I like her too much. That's why I can't make a move. 

JERRY

You put her on a pedestal. 

KRAMER

I put them on a dental chair. 

JERRY

He puts 'em on a dental chair. 

GEORGE

I'm not her boyfriend. I want to be her boyfriend. 

KRAMER

Whoo. It's like a sauna in here. 

GEORGE

That's funny. You're a funny guy. 

JERRY

Yeah, funny. Yeah, I never heard that before. (To George) So, you goin' to the funeral? 

GEORGE

Why, you think I should? 

JERRY

What, are you kidding? It's a golden opportunity to advance the relationship. She's crying, you put your arm around her and console her...you're the consolation guy! 

GEORGE

I'm the consolation guy...? 

KRAMER

Consolation Guy is big. 

JERRY

Her aunt dying is the best thing that ever happened to you. 

KRAMER

It's like ten dates in one shot. 

JERRY

This confers upon you instant boyfriend status. The family's there...you're taking care of things...you're gettin' the sandwiches...you're the rock! 

GEORGE

It's in Detroit though, it's an expensive flight. 

KRAMER

Why don't you get a 'death in the family' fare? 

GEORGE

What? 

KRAMER

You go to the airlines, you tell them you got a death in the family? They give you 50% off the fare. 

GEORGE

Really? 

KRAMER

In fact, listen...I'll go down there with ya. You know, we'll tell them there's a death in my family, you buy the ticket, I'll split it...then I'll get the bonus miles and you'll get to Detroit for a quarter of the price! 

SIDRA

So anyway, we go out on one date, he asks me out for a second, then out of nowhere he cancels the date and says he doesn't want to see me again. 

ELAINE

Uh...sorry, I couldn't help overhearing. 

SIDRA

Oh, that's o.k. 

ELAINE

Did he give you a reason? 

SIDRA

Yeah. He's going back to his old girlfriend. 

ELAINE

Really? 

SIDRA

He said she's mentally ill. He's one of those guys who is obsessed with neatness and order? Everything has gotta be just so. He would have made a great Nazi. 

ELAINE

Hey, does he ever talk about Superman? 

SIDRA

Yes! How did you know? 

ELAINE

Oh, I know the type. 

SIDRA

So you can relate? 

ELAINE

Oh, yeah. 

SIDRA

You know, I've seen you around the club. My name's Sidra. This is Marcy. 

ELAINE

Oh, hi. I'm Elaine. (Gets up to shake Sidra's hand, but stumbles and falls 'right into them.') 

ELAINE

So anyway, I stood up to shake her hand, then suddenly I lost my balance and I fell right into her. 

JERRY

You fell on her? 

ELAINE

I touched 'em. 

JERRY

You what? 

ELAINE

I...touched...'em. 

JERRY

You touched 'em?! 

ELAINE

I needed them to help me break my fall! If it hadn't been for them, I could have really injured myself! 

JERRY

Wow. 

ELAINE

Anyway...they're real. 

JERRY

Excuse me?! 

ELAINE

I think they might be real. 

JERRY

Oh, what do you know, you have no breast touching experience. 

ELAINE

I've touched mine! 

JERRY

So have I. 

ELAINE

Oh, right...I forgot. (smiles) 

JERRY

Anyway, touching two breasts doesn't make you an expert. 

ELAINE

Alright, well anyway, I think they're real. And if they are, I must say they are...spectacular. 

JERRY

Aw, what are you doin' to me? (puts his head down on the counter.) 

GEORGE

You see, my friend here, his aunt passed away last night. 

CLERK

Oh, I'm very sorry. 

KRAMER

I saw her last week, she looked healthy and peaceful, but...she knew... 

CLERK

You poor thing! 

KRAMER

I...I... 

GEORGE

You don't think you can buy the ticket yourself...? No, there, there...you sit, and I'll purchase the ticket for you. 

CLERK

You're a good friend. 

GEORGE

I understand you offer a 50%-off 'bereavement' fare...? 

CLERK

Yes, all you have to do is pay the full fare now, then return to any one of our counters with a copy of the death certificate, and we'll refund half your fare. 

GEORGE

The death certificate? 

CLERK

Yes, yes, we do need documentation or you know, people could take advantage. 

GEORGE

What kind of a sick person would do a thing like that? 

CLERK

I know! But it happens. 

GEORGE

You want my friend to ask his uncle, a man who just lost his wife of 44 years, for a death certificate so that he can save a few bucks on a flight? 

CLERK

That would be $387 round-trip. 

KRAMER

Alright, so you'll need my frequent flyer number, huh? 

CLERK

Yes. 

JERRY

I don't know, one minute you say they're fake, the next minute you think they're real...I don't know what to believe! 

ELAINE

Hey, of the two of us, I'm the only one who's touched 'em. 

JERRY

But you were just grabbing on to them to save your life. If you were drowning and I threw you a life preserver, you think you could tell me if it was an inflatable? 

ELAINE

I wouldn't have said anything if I knew you were going to stop seeing her! 

JERRY

Well, I don't mind someone with a phony personality, but I gotta draw the line somewhere. 

KRAMER

Hey! 

JERRY

Hey. George off to Detroit? 

KRAMER

Yep! And, in two days, I'm off to Puerto Rico. 

ELAINE

Hey Kramer, by the way, I saw that guy at the health club...that is not Salman Rushdie. 

KRAMER

Pffft - wrong. 

JERRY

There's Sidra. 

KRAMER

There's Salman. 

JERRY

Where? 

KRAMER

Talkin' to that woman. 

JERRY

Talkin' to Sidra? 

KRAMER

If that's Sidra, she's talkin' to Salman. 

JERRY

I don't think that's Salman. 

KRAMER

Well, I don't think they're real. 

JERRY

If that's Rushdie, they're real. 

KRAMER

If they're real, that's Rushdie. 

JERRY

Well, I gotta know - I'm talkin' to Sidra. 

KRAMER

I gotta know, I'm talkin' to Salman. 

KRAMER

It's like a sauna in here, huh? I feel like I'm...back at the desert. 

KRAMER

Oh, yeah. Yeah, I've uh...I've spent a little time in the Mideast. You ever been to the Mideast? 

KRAMER

My name's Kramer. 

KRAMER

So, uh...what kind of work do you do? 

BETSY

Have you met my boyfriend George? 

MAY

No! (shakes George's hand.) 

BETSY

George, this is Aunt May, and Father Jessup. Oh, and that's my brother, Timmy. (Timmy smiles thinly.) This is my boyfriend, George. 

MAY

Oh George, how nice of you to come all this way. 

GEORGE

Well, I'm the boyfriend. Otherwise, what's the point of being the boyfriend? This is where you have to be when you're the boyfriend. 

MAY

Betsy, dear, have you had anything to eat? 

BETSY

I'm not very hungry. 

MAY

They have some very nice snacks. 

JESSUP

I'm about to get myself a snack. 

GEORGE

Oh, no, no, no...you sit right here...I will get you a nice snack. 

JESSUP

This is my third wake this month. It never gets any easier. 

GEORGE

Well, losing a loved is, uh...I mean, forget about it. (Starts wolfing down the sandwiches.) 

JESSUP

You seem to be of great comfort to Betsy, we're very appreciative. 

GEORGE

Oh - comfort, schmomfort. Listen, Father, can I ask you a question? In a terrible time like this...who would I get the death certificate from? 

KRAMER

C'mon Jerry! 

JERRY

Oh, how can you be so sure? 

KRAMER

Jerry, are you blind? He's a writer. He said his name was Sal Bass. Bass, Jerry! Instead of salmon, he went with bass! He just substituted one fish for another! 

JERRY

Look, you idiot, first of all, it's Salman, not salmon! 

KRAMER

Jerry, Jerry, you're missing the big picture! 

JERRY

Alright, maybe it is, but listen, I gotta get ready - Sidra's coming over in a few minutes, so if you don't mind... 

KRAMER

What, did you ask her? 

JERRY

I'm gonna find out tonight. 

KRAMER

Oh, yes indeed... 

ALLENWOOD

Why do you need a death certificate? 

GEORGE

Well, Dr, Allenwood, uh...I was hoping to compile an - admittedly, rudimentary - scrapbook of her life. Something that Betsy could have, and hold onto. 

ALLENWOOD

Well, I suppose I could make a copy of it. 

GEORGE

Oh, that would be wonderful. 

ALLENWOOD

It was very nice meeting you, George. 

GEORGE

Likewise. 

TIMMY

What are you doing? 

GEORGE

What? 

TIMMY

Did...did you just double-dip that chip? 

GEORGE

Excuse me? 

TIMMY

You double-dipped the chip! 

GEORGE

'Double-dipped'? What are you talking about? 

TIMMY

You dipped the chip. You took a bite. (points at the dip) And you dipped again. 

GEORGE

So...? 

TIMMY

That's like putting your whole mouth right in the dip! From now on, when you take a chip - just take one dip and end it! 

GEORGE

Well, I'm sorry, Timmy...but I don't dip that way. (takes a chip.) 

TIMMY

Oh, you don't, huh? 

GEORGE

No. (dips the chip) You dip the way you want to dip...(bites the chip) I'll dip the way I want to dip. (dips the chip again.) 

TIMMY

Gimme the chip! (Grabs George and the chip goes flying.) Gimme the chip! (They struggle in front of the snack table.) 

SIDRA

I don't know what I'm doing here, I must be crazy. (Moves to the couch and sits on the left side. Jerry tries to run over and beat her to it, but doesn't make it. He sits down on the right side.) 

JERRY

Hey, would you mind switching seats? 

SIDRA

Why? 

JERRY

Oh, I don't know...I just like sitting to the left of people, makes me feel like I'm driving. 

SIDRA

O.K....(they switch places.) 

JERRY

How ya doin'? 

SIDRA

Good. How you doin'? 

JERRY

Good, feel good...you know that Jayne Mansfield had some big breasts. Really big, huge...just coming out the top of her dress, they were like, chokin' her. 

SIDRA

I hear that's how she died. 

JERRY

Have you noticed that women today are, you know, they seem...bigger. 

SIDRA

Well, a lot of women are having them done. 

JERRY

Really? 

SIDRA

Yeah. 

JERRY

How do you like that. 

SIDRA

A lot of people ask me if I've had mine done. 

JERRY

Aw, you know people. 

SIDRA

It gets a little tiring, it's really none of their business. 

JERRY

Oh, the nerve. You know, some people have asked me if you've uh, done that. 

SIDRA

What do you tell them? 

JERRY

Whatever you want me to tell them. 

SIDRA

Well, I think you'll find out soon enough. (They prepare to kiss. There's a loud bang on the door.) Aren't you going to get that? 

JERRY

No. 

SIDRA

What if it's an emergency? 

JERRY

Oh, there's no emergency... 

KRAMER

Jerry! C'mon, it's an emergency! 

JERRY

Excuse me. (Gets up and answers the door.) Alright, what is it? You're interrupting! 

KRAMER

Well, you know, I'm packing for Puerto Rico, I need to borrow your bathing suit. 

JERRY

This is an emergency? You need a bathing suit? 

KRAMER

Well, I like yours. 

JERRY

I don't know, my bathing suit? That's a little familiar, I don't want your...your boys down there. 

KRAMER

C'mon, what's wrong with my boys? 

JERRY

Your boys should stay in their neighborhood. 

KRAMER

Alright, c'mon! 

JERRY

Alright. It's in the top drawer. Hurry up. (Kramer goes to get the suit. Elaine enters.) 

ELAINE

Hi, Jer. 

JERRY

Oh, hi, Elaine. 

ELAINE

Oh...hi, Sidra - 

SIDRA

Hi...Elaine? (Kramer comes back into the living room.) 

JERRY

What are you doing here? 

ELAINE

I'm looking for Kramer. 

KRAMER

Yeah, she was just showing me pictures of places I can visit when I go to Puerto Rico...you know, when you two went down there? 

JERRY

Oh. yeah. Alright. (pushes Kramer and Elaine out the door, then sits next to Sidra on the couch.) So, where were we? 

SIDRA

I was just leaving. 

JERRY

Right, you were leaving. 

SIDRA

I can't believe you sent a woman into the sauna to do that. 

JERRY

That was an accident! 

SIDRA

I think you're both mentally ill. (leaves, then opens the door again.) And by the way...they're real, and they're spectacular. (Sidra leaves.) 

BETSY

Stop it, George! Get out! Get out! I never want to see you again! 

ALLENWOOD

Go back to New York! Get out! 

GEORGE

Well, you see, what happened was...the doctor - the very same doctor that was attending to my late aunt - suffered an untimely stroke, and lost the use of his right hand, so...obviously I was unable to get the death certificate. However, I do have this. (Reaches inside his coat and takes out a Polaroid photo.) 

GEORGE

That's a picture of me next to the coffin. 

GEORGE

Not even close, huh? 

GEORGE

You met her at the supermarket? How did you do that? 

JERRY

(flips a roll of paper towels in the air) Produce section. *Very* provocative area. A lot of melons and shapes. Everyone's squeezing and smelling... It just happened. 

GEORGE

(laughs-hu) So when're you gonna see her? 

JERRY

Tonight. 

GEORGE

What's her name? 

JERRY

I... don't... know... 

GEORGE

How could you not know her name? 

JERRY

I was a little nervous, I got distracted. It has something to do with a car, or a fish... 

JERRY

Look at that. Why do I get bananas? They're good for *one* day... 

GEORGE

Oh my God, I forgot to tell you. I got a letter today from the State Controller's Office. Y'know when I was going to public school back in Brooklyn, every week I used to put fifty cents in the Lincoln Savings Bank. 

JERRY

Yeah, I did that too. 

GEORGE

Yeah, You remember the, the little eh, bank book, there? 

JERRY

Sure. 

GEORGE

Alright, so I haven't put anything in it since sixth grade, I completely forgot about it. The State Controller's Office tracks me down. The interest has accumulated to 1,900 dollars. 1,900 dollars! They're sending me a cheque! 

JERRY

Wow! 

GEORGE

Hu-Yeah, interest. It's an amazing thing. You make money without doing anything... 

JERRY

Y'know I have some friends who try and base their whole life on that principle. 

GEORGE

Really? Who? 

JERRY

Nobody you know... 

GEORGE

Maybe I'll go down to the track. Put it all on a horse... 

JERRY

Why don't you put it in the *bank*? 

GEORGE

The *bank*? This is *found* money. I want to *parlay* it. I wanna make a big score! 

JERRY

*Oh*, you mean you wanna *lose* it... 

KRAMER

Yeah... All right....Ya got it, eh. 

JERRY

Yes I did. 

KRAMER

Yes. 

GEORGE

What's with the gloves? 

KRAMER

Well, I'm staining my floors, y'know, I don't want to get my hands dirty... 

GEORGE

Huh. What, the whole apartment? 

KRAMER

The whole apartment. And I'm buying that fake wood wallpaper. I'm gonna surround myself in wood. It's gonna be like a log cabin. 'Cuz I *need* wood around me. Wood, Jerry [Snaps fingers]... Wood. 

JERRY

Wood is good. 

KRAMER

Definitely. 

JERRY

So we're still going to the health club to play racquetball right? 

KRAMER

Yeah, yeah, whenever you're ready. 

JERRY

O.K., soon as Elaine gets here. 

KRAMER

Yep. 

JERRY

What, you rented 'Home Alone'? 

GEORGE

Yeah. 

JERRY

I thought you saw that already... 

GEORGE

No, I saw 'Home Alone II'. 

JERRY

Oh, right... But you *hated* it! 

GEORGE

Well I was lost, I never saw the first one. By the way, you mind if I watch it here? 

JERRY

What for? 

GEORGE

Because if I watch it at my apartment I feel like I'm not doing anything. If I watch it here, I'm out of the house; I'm doing something. 

JERRY

All right.. Go ahead. 

JERRY

Yeah? 

ELAINE

(on the intercom) It's me, are you ready to go? 

JERRY

No. Come on up. 

KRAMER

I can't work with these! 

JERRY

What's wrong? 

KRAMER

Well, you bought me dishwashing gloves. There's no *fine touch*... 

JERRY

You said 'gloves'... 

KRAMER

No, no, these are too thick.&nbsp; (removes the gloves/tosses them on the kitchen counter) 

KRAMER

Oooh, is that 'Home Alone'? 

GEORGE

Yeah. The *original*. 

ELAINE

Hey Boys-O! 

EVERYONE

(in unison) Heyyyyyyyy. 

KRAMER

Hey, how's it goin'? 

ELAINE

Hello. 

JERRY

(to Kramer) Hey (snaps fingers) get your stuff, let's get going. 

ELAINE

Well wait a minute, there's a slight change of plans. 

JERRY

What? 

ELAINE

eh, Remember Roy, the artist? 

JERRY

Oh, the 'triangle' guy. 

ELAINE

Yeah, exactly, the 'triangle' guy. 

JERRY

Yeah, you liked him. What happened with him? 

ELAINE

Yeah I did. He was very talented. He was, ah just, I don't know a little too... 

JERRY

Artsy? 

ELAINE

Fat. 

JERRY

Oh. (unh - very quiet sigh) 

ELAINE

He was a fat, starving artist, y'know. That's very rare. 

JERRY

Yeah. 

ELAINE

Anyway, he's in the hospital, he's having surgery and I feel like should go visit him. 

JERRY

What's wrong with him? 

ELAINE

Unh, something with his spleen.&nbsp; Anyway it'll just take five minutes, O.K., and then, the hospital is right on the way. 

KRAMER

Yeah. (putting hand to his mouth, hatching a thought) 

JERRY

All right we'll wait for you. 

KRAMER

Yeah, maybe I can get some rubber gloves there huh, yea. 

ELAINE

Listen, Jerry can you do me a favor? (clears throat) Could you, go into the room with me to visit him because ah, I don't want him to think that I'm, y'know... interested. 

JERRY

Oh, you want me to pretend to be your boyfriend. 

ELAINE

Well... 

JERRY

Well I think I can do that. I believe I've played that role before to some critical acclaim. 

ELAINE

Aha ha ha (laugh) 

KRAMER

All right, lets go. 

JERRY

All right (picks up his sports bag) 

KRAMER

Yep yep yep. 

ELAINE

What's with him? 

JERRY

Y'know a lot of people have asked that... 

ELAINE

Roy! 

ROY

*Elaine*! What a *surprise*.&nbsp; (sitting up) 

ELAINE

(gasp) Oh, my *God*! I hardly recognize you! You look so... 

ROY

Yeah, ya know, I've lost some weight... 

ELAINE

A *lot* of weight. (enthusiastically) 

ROY

I know. 

ELAINE

Aha hu, You look *terrific*. 

ROY

Thank you. So do you. 

ELAINE

Ah hahaha hhuu ha (flirty laughing) 

ELAINE

Ah, This is... uh... you *really* lost weight. 

ROY

Thank you. 

JERRY

Jerry, uh, I'm the boyfriend. (puts his arm around Elaine's shoulder, but she shrugs it off twice) 

VOICEOVER

Doctor Wittenberg, Outside call. Doctor Wittenberg, Outside call. 

WOMAN

AHAaaaaaaaaa!&nbsp; (scream) 

KRAMER

(a bit startled) Ahh. 

VOICEOVER

Doctor Wittenberg, Outside call. 

KRAMER

Ah, the mother lode!&nbsp; (the door squeaks a bit as he pushes it open) 

ELAINE

I can't believe it! You were *huge*! Like blubber! I couldn't even get my arms around you... 

ROY

Yesss, I remember. 

ELAINE

Ahahaha. Well that's the positive thing about getting sick, you get to lose weight. 

ROY

Elaine, it wasn't the illness. It was you. 

ELAINE

Me? 

ROY

(quietly- yeah) After you stopped seeing me, I was devastated. I couldn't eat for weeks. 

ELAINE

*Get* *out*! 

ROY

Really, it's the truth. 

ELAINE

Jerry, did you hear this? He couldn't eat for weeks... 

JERRY

That's terrible... 

ELAINE

I had no idea I had that kind of effect on you. 

ROY

You did. 

JERRY

You know I can't get this *damn thing* to sleep. (about the Yo-Yo) 

ELAINE

Now listen Roy, tell me something. When, are you gettin' out of here? 

ROY

Next Thursday. 

ELAINE

Okay, I'll tell you what. How about on Friday I take you out for a *big* meal because *you* are getting *too* thin... 

JERRY

Honey... Aren't we going to the Poconos next Friday? 

ELAINE

No that's the week after. 

JERRY

No, I believe it's next week. 

ELAINE

You're wrong. 

JERRY

No I'm not... 

ELAINE

Shut up... 

KRAMER

Pay dirt!&nbsp; (holding up the hand full of gloves. He looks behind himself as the door closes) 

ELAINE

Uh Roy, this is uh Kramer -- he's one of our friends. 

ROY

Oh, How do you do? 

KRAMER

Yeah... I do great, yeah. 

DOCTOR

Hi Roy. 

ROY

Oh, hey Dr. Siegel. 

JERRY

Hey Doc, check this out. [does an around-the-world with the Yo-Yo] 

KRAMER

Heey. 

JERRY

I *just* learned that.&nbsp; (proudly holding the Yo-Yo) 

DOCTOR

I just wanted to stop by -- see if you had any questions about tomorrow's operation. 

KRAMER

Ah, Yeah Yeah, I have a - I have a question, um -- What do you know about inter-abdominal retractors? 

DOCTOR

Are you asking because you saw '20/20' last night? 

KRAMER

I sure am. 

DOCTOR

Well that report was about *one* very specific type of retractor and I can assure you we do not use that retractor in your friend's procedure. 

KRAMER

But you *will* use... a retractor. 

DOCTOR

We have to... 

KRAMER

Mmm-hmm... (turns and walks away, makes a face, raises his eyebrows, nodding his head, then turns back to the group.) 

DOCTOR

Tell you what. You're obviously concerned about your friend's welfare. A few of my students will be observing tomorrow's operation from the viewing gallery. How would you like to watch it with them? 

KRAMER

I'd love to watch the operation, yeah! 

JERRY

I dunno... 

KRAMER

Oh, come on Jerry. You gotta see the operation. They're gonna cut him open -- His guts'll be all over the place... 

JERRY

Yeah, that's true... 

KRAMER

...They'll saw through bone.&nbsp; Uuuuuuuing yutyutyutyutn naannnaaa [makes saw noises while gesturing over Roy's chest] You'll see what's *inside* bone... 

GEORGE

Ttu (wipes nose and sniffs) Ttu. 

JERRY

Hey. 

GEORGE

Hi... 

JERRY

What are doing, you crying?? 

GEORGE

No... (takes off his glasses and wipes his eyes with his sleeve) 

JERRY

You crying from 'Home Alone'?? 

GEORGE

The old man got to me. 

JERRY

Alright, just get yourself together... I dunno if I can be friends with you anymore after this display. 

GEORGE

Oh Shut up! What are you doing back so soon, anyway? (puts the tape back in it's case.) 

JERRY

Oh, I never even got to the gym. Kramer got the gloves, wanted to come home and start working on his floor. 

GEORGE

Oh. How's the guy? 

JERRY

Oh, he's okay. In fact him and Elaine are getting ah, pretty chummy. Now Elaine wants me to buy some of his art. (opens the fridge and gets a bottle of water.) 

GEORGE

Hnh. That's nerve... 

JERRY

Yeah, so she and 'Triangle Boy' can go out to fancy restaurants. (takes a sip of water) 

GEORGE

Y'know what it is? It's 'Clara Nightingale Syndrome.'&nbsp; He falls ill; she falls in love. 

JERRY

You mean Florence Nightingale. ** 

GEORGE

What'd I say? Clara? 

JERRY

Yeah, you must have meant Clara Barton. ** 

GEORGE

Clara Barton? What did she do? 

JERRY

I'm not sure, but I think she was nice. (takes a sip of water) 

GEORGE

Susan B. Anthony** I think I'd have a problem with. 

JERRY

Yeah, I think you would. 

GEORGE

So, you gonna buy his art? 

JERRY

No. Why don't you buy it? You got 1,900 dollars. 

GEORGE

Yeah, that's what I want-- triangles. Alright, I'm outta here. Have fun with what's-her-name. 

JERRY

I will. 

GEORGE

Y'know, now you gotta ask her her name. It's so embarrassing. 

JERRY

No, it isn't. I can find out. 

GEORGE

Yeah? How? 

JERRY

There are ways. 

JERRY

Y'know I remember when I was a kid growin up, kids would make fun of my name like you wouldn't believe-- 'Jerry Jerry Dingleberry', and-hu 'Seinsmelled'... 

WOMAN

'Seinsmelled'? 

JERRY

Yeah. a-hu. What about you? Did people make fun of your name? 

WOMAN

Are you kidding? They were merciless! What do you expect when your name rhymes with a part of the female anatomy? 

WOMAN

(con't) Of course, not everybody can be as sweet as you are. 

WOMAN

Oh, oh Jerry... 

JERRY

Oh... *you*... 

GEORGE

Now let's try 'breast'... Celeste... Kest... 

JERRY

No. 

GEORGE

Rest... Sest... Hest... 

JERRY

'Hest'? That's not a name. 

GEORGE

What, you should've just asked her. 

JERRY

I know, I should've asked her. 

GEORGE

What're you gonna do now? 

JERRY

I dunno. I can't ask her now; I've already made out with her. Once you make out with a woman, you can't ask her her name. 

GEORGE

Aretha!&nbsp; (points finger at Jerry) 

JERRY

No... 

GEORGE

Bovary!&nbsp; (points finger again at Jerry) 

JERRY

Alright, that's enough. (sips coffee) 

GEORGE

Alright, well you know what'cha gotta do, you gotta go through her purse. Y'know, the-the credit cards, driver's license... 

JERRY

How am I gonna do that? 

GEORGE

When she goes to the bathroom. 

KRAMER

Ah, (smacks hands) there you are. My date stood me up. Listen, will you guys go to the operation with me? 

JERRY

You asked a date to go to the operation? 

KRAMER

Yeah... So c'mon,&nbsp; (smacks hands and rubs them together) what d'you say? 

GEORGE

What kind of operation is it? 

KRAMER

Spleenectomy. 

GEORGE

Isn't that where they remove the-- 

KRAMER

No No, Don't ruin it for me, I haven't seen it yet! Ah-C'mon, what d'you say? 

GEORGE

Mulva! (again pointing finger at Jerry -- Kramer watches the exchange back and forth) 

JERRY

Mulva? (waves off George with his hand) 

KRAMER

C'mon, C'mon. You wanna go? (pats Jerry a couple times on the shoulder quietly) C'mon. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

JERRY

Alright, alright. Just let me finish my coffee... then we'll watch 'em go slice this fat bastard up. (sips coffee) 

DOCTOR

Now we'll open the peritoneal cavity, exposing the body's internal organs. Nurse-- retractor. 

JERRY

What are you eating? 

KRAMER

Junior Mints. Do you want one? 

JERRY

No... 

KRAMER

Now, I can't see..... Psst.... Psst... 

KRAMER

... Cou, ye, ge... 

KRAMER

Y-ea (pours a few more Junior Mints into his hand and eats them) 

JERRY

Where'd you get those? 

KRAMER

The machine. You want one? 

JERRY

No. 

KRAMER

Here, take one. 

JERRY

I don't want one. 

KRAMER

No, they're good! Take one.. 

JERRY

I don't want any! 

KRAMER

Just take one. 

JERRY

No! Stop it! Kramer, stop it! 

JERRY

(pointing at the operation he mouths the words) Did it go in? 

KRAMER

Ge-- 

JERRY

...Over the balcony, bounced off some respirator thing *into* the patient! 

GEORGE

What do you mean 'into the patient'? 

JERRY

Into the patient, *literally*! 

GEORGE

Into the hole? 

JERRY

Yes, the hole! 

GEORGE

Didn't they notice it? 

JERRY

No! 

GEORGE

How could they not notice it?!? 

JERRY

Because it's a little mint. It's a *Junior* Mint. 

GEORGE

W-ca-What did they do? 

JERRY

They sealed him up with the mint inside. 

GEORGE

They *left* the Junior Mint *in* him? 

JERRY

Yes! 

GEORGE

I-I guess it can't hurt him... People eat *pounds* of those things. 

JERRY

Yes they *eat* them. They don't put them next to vital organs in their abdominal cavity! 

JERRY

Yeah. 

ELAINE

It's me. 

JERRY

Come on up. 

KRAMER

Hey. This wallpaper is *very* good. My place looks like a ski lodge! 

JERRY

Why did you force that mint on me? I told ya I didn't want the mint! 

KRAMER

Well, I didn't believe you. 

JERRY

How could you not believe me?!? 

KRAMER

Well who's gonna turn down a Junior Mint? It's chocolate, it's peppermint-- it's *delicious*! 

JERRY

That's true. 

KRAMER

It's very refreshing! 

JERRY

Well, just don't say anything about this to Elaine... 

ELAINE

Prognosis... negative. 

JERRY

Prognosis *negative*!? 

ELAINE

He's not doing well, the doctors don't know what it is. They're baffled. 

KRAMER

Oh, my God... 

ELAINE

Just my luck, y'know... just when he's getting thin and attractive. Y'know Jerry, you should buy some of his art. That would really lift his spirits. 

GEORGE

It's that bleak? (pours a glass of milk) 

ELAINE

Mmm... (Elaine goes to the bathroom) 

GEORGE

Y'know if the guy dies, the art could really be worth something... 

JERRY

We gotta confess. 

KRAMER

Really? 

JERRY

Yes! 

KRAMER

We could be tried for murder... 

JERRY

I can't have this on my conscience. We're like Leopold and Loeb! ** 

KRAMER

You're not gonna say anything, you got that? 

JERRY

I'm telling and you can't stop me! 

KRAMER

You're *not*!!! 

GEORGE

Hey Elaine? Put me down for some of that art. 1,900 dollars worth. 

JERRY

Oh yeah, that's the spot... 

WOMAN

What're you so tense about? 

JERRY

Oh, nothing really, just a homicide. [She finds the right spot on his back] Oh that's terrific... Mulva. 

WOMAN

What? 

JERRY

Mulva? 

WOMAN

Mulva? 

JERRY

Oh my eh, my Aunt's name is Mulva. She's-she's a masseuse. 

WOMAN

huh. 

JERRY

Yeah. 

WOMAN

Um, I'm going to the bathroom. I'll be right back. 

JERRY

Oh, good idea... 

WOMAN

What are you doing? 

JERRY

Oh, I was just looking for er, some... gum or... mint. 

WOMAN

Oh, I have Junior Mints. 

JERRY

No! [throws her purse back at her] No, I mean, no thank you, nah... 

KRAMER

Any news? 

JERRY

[whispering] No, no news. You better get out of here. 

KRAMER

Oh. 

JERRY

Oh No, wait a second... Wait a second... I-I don't know the name of this woman in the bathroom, so when she comes out, you introduce yourself and then she'll be forced to say her name. 

KRAMER

10-4. 

JERRY

O.K. (closes the apartment door) 

WOMAN

Oh, hello. 

KRAMER

Hello, I'm Kramer. 

WOMAN

Nice to meet you. 

KRAMER

See you later. (He promptly turns and leaves) 

WOMAN

Well, I better get going. I don't want to be late for the play. (Grabs her coat.) 

JERRY

Oh, okay. 

WOMAN

Y'know my cousin knows the producer. I may get to go backstage and meet Olympia Dukakis. 

JERRY

Oh, Hey, there's a name you don't forget. 

WOMAN

Mm. Bye Jerry. 

JERRY

Bye. 

WOMAN

Oh, hi. 

GEORGE

Oh, Hi, I'm George. (they shake hands) 

WOMAN

Oh, Nice to meet you, George. 

GEORGE

Yeahaha, I gave it a shot (pats Jerry on the arm)... So, any word on the 'artiste'?&nbsp; (puts a video in the VCR) 

JERRY

No, I haven't heard anything. 

GEORGE

Hehe. Well, I got my triangles. (sitting on the couch) 

JERRY

Really... 

GEORGE

Yup, y'know, they really spruce up the apartment. 

JERRY

Yeah, I'm sure... 

JERRY

Well, I-I gotta call the Hospital. I gotta tell 'em what happened. 

GEORGE

No-no Jerry. I wouldn't do that. 

JERRY

Why? 

GEORGE

Ehh, You could get in trouble. 

JERRY

Look, I gotta try and help the guy. 

GEORGE

Who are you to play God!? Every man's time comes! If his number is up, who are you to interfere!? 

JERRY

Yes I'd like to speak with Dr. Siegel... it's about Roy Kordic's condition... 

GEORGE

W-What? What? 

JERRY

Oh, that's *fantastic*! 

GEORGE

He didn't get better, did he? 

JERRY

Thank you very much. O.K. Bye-bye. He's gonna be okay! 

GEORGE

Where's the luck? There's no luck. 1,900 dollars down the drain. 

ROY

You saved my life, George. You buying my art is what inspired me to get better. I'll never forget what'cha did for me. 

GEORGE

Oh, well th-that's great. It's really great.&nbsp; Hm hm mm. 

KRAMER

Y'know, art's a great investment. 

ELAINE

And they're gonna look great in your apartment, George. 

GEORGE

Yes I look forward to many years of... looking at the triangles. Well, I'll ah, I'll wait for you outside. 

ROY

Hey, George... 

GEORGE

Yeah. 

KRAMER

Awe, alright 

JERRY

That's nice. 

GEORGE

Thanks Roy. 

ROY

Heeyy - there's the guy who saved my life. (points at the doctor.) 

DOCTOR

Y'know... I don't want to totally discount the emotional element in your recovery but, I think there were other factors at play here. 

JERRY

What do you mean? 

DOCTOR

I have no medical evidence to back me up but, something happened during the operation that staved off that infection. Something beyond science. Something perhaps, from above... 

DOCTOR

Those can be very refreshing. 

ROY

So Elaine... Where are we going for our big dinner on Friday? (takes a big mouthful of spaghetti) 

ELAINE

Uh-m, uh I'm so sorry Roy, but actually, we are going to the, Poconos on Friday, right honey? (pointing to Jerrythe boyfriend?) 

JERRY

I don't think so... 

ELAINE

We are... that means that we ah, we are... 

JERRY

I believe we're not... 

ELAINE

(Catching another glimpse of Roy eating) Hunh, Please can we go to the Poconos? 

JERRY

Well, I'll think about it... 

WOMAN

Great seats. You could see the actors spitting. 

JERRY

Really... 

WOMAN

Uh-huh. And afterwards we went backstage and Olympia Dukakis autographed my playbill. 

JERRY

Oh, Wait a second, you got her autograph? 

WOMAN

Yeah. 

JERRY

Do you have it with you? 

WOMAN

Yeah, it's in my purse. 

JERRY

Ah, Le'me see.&nbsp; (hands Jerry the playbill) 

WOMAN

Y'know I really think I'm falling for you, Jerry Seinfeld. (stands up, a quick&nbsp; kiss on the cheek and hugs him.) 

WOMAN

Oh, well, I really think I'm falling for you... [opens the playbill and flips five pages till he finds and reads autograph] .....Joseph Puglia... 

WOMAN

I had it autographed for my uncle. 

JERRY

Yeah, I-I know... 

WOMAN

(licks he lips) You don't know my name, do you? 

JERRY

Yes I do. 

WOMAN

What is it? 

JERRY

It-it rhymes with a female body part. 

WOMAN

What is it? 

JERRY

Mulva... 

JERRY

Aub, ah, Gipple? 

JERRY

Loleola? 

JERRY

Oh! Oh! *Delores*! 

JERRY

Ages zero through ten, candy is your life. There's nothing else. Family, friends, school-- they're only obstacles in the way of getting more candy. And you have your favorite candies that you love. You know the ones I love those... I hate those...''. ``I hate those... I love those...''.&nbsp; And only a seven year old kid could actually taste the difference between like a red M&M and a light brown, M&M. That's two totally different things when you're seven years old. 'Well, your red is more of a main course M&M, but the brown it's more of a mellower flavor; it's an after dinner M&M, really''. 

JERRY

...And it *is* embarrassing, because a doggie bag means either you are out at a restaurant when you aren't hungry, or you've chosen the stupidest possible way to get dog food that there is. How about the doggie bag on a date? That's a good move for a guy, huh? Lemme tell you something: if you're a guy and you ask for the doggie bag on a date, you might as well have them just wrap up your genitals too. You're not going to be needing those for awhile, either. 

JERRY

Is that bothering you? 

ELAINE

No, not at all... 

ELAINE

Oh, could you please hurry? 

JERRY

[mockingly] 'Please hurry'. Look at you. Look at what you've become. 

ELAINE

What? What have I become? I haven't 'become' anything... 

JERRY

Oh, *Carl* can't wait a few more minutes? 

ELAINE

I don't want to keep him waiting... 

JERRY

He'll like you more... 

ELAINE

That's impossible... 

WIFE

Andrew, why do you have to pick your teeth at the table? 

HUSBAND

Leave me alone. 

JERRY

Yeah, I'm wanting to get married *real* soon... 

JERRY

So, where am I dropping you? 

ELAINE

His place... 

JERRY

This guy's got quite a racket. I take you to dinner and then drop you off at his apartment... 

ELAINE

*And* he gets the rest of my chicken... 

JERRY

So, is tonight 'the night'? 

ELAINE

You never know... 

JERRY

Oooh! Bay-bee *doll*! 

JERRY

Boy, do you smell something? 

ELAINE

Do I smell something? What am I, hard of smelling? Of *course* I smell something. 

JERRY

What is it? 

ELAINE

I think it's B.O.! 

JERRY

What? 

ELAINE

It's B.O. The *valet* must have had B.O. 

JERRY

It *can't* be. Nobody has B.O. like this. 

ELAINE

Jerry. It's *B*.*O*. 

JERRY

But the whole car smells. 

ELAINE

So? 

JERRY

So when somebody has B.O., the 'O' usually stays with the 'B'. Once the 'B' leaves, the 'O' goes with it. 

ELAINE

I can't believe you ski! 

CARL

I'm a great skier. 

ELAINE

Yeah? What else? 

CARL

Let's see... I ski, I fish, I pillage, I plunder... 

ELAINE

[delightedly] Oh! You 'pillage and plunder'? 

CARL

...When I travel. 

ELAINE

See? Finally, *finally* I get to meet a man who pillages and plunders! I'm so lucky. 

GEORGE

This'll only take a second. 

KRAMER

Yeah, I'm going to poke around... 

GEORGE

[to himself] Hey, whatd'ya know? Look at that! A *lesbian* sighting. Oh-ho! My lucky day. They're *so* fascinating. Why is that? Because they don't want us. You gotta respect that... 

GEORGE

[to himself] Oh, my God! It's Susan! What do I do? 

SUSAN

George? 

GEORGE

[to himself] Argh! [to Susan] Susan! Hi! Oh, boy! What are you doing here?! 

SUSAN

Renting a video! What do you got there? 

GEORGE

Oh, ... some stupid movie... 

SUSAN

This is Mona. 

GEORGE

Oh, hi... 

MONA

Pleasure to meet you. 

GEORGE

Yes. Well... 

MONA

Well, I'll let you two, uh... catch up. 

SUSAN

You okay? 

GEORGE

Yeah. Yes! I just haven't seen you in a long time. 

SUSAN

And you didn't expect me to be holding hands with a woman. 

GEORGE

Oh, *please*! Me? C'mon! That's *great*! Are you kidding? I think thats fan*tastic*! I've always encouraged experimentation! I'm the first guy in the pool! Who do you think you're talking to? 

SUSAN

I *know* who I'm talking to. 

GEORGE

Of course you do... It's just, uh, y'know, I-I never *knew*, uh, that, uh... 

SUSAN

I liked women? 

GEORGE

There you go. 

GEORGE

So, uh, how long has this been going on? 

SUSAN

Since you and I broke up. 

GEORGE

Ssssso, after me, you... went that way? 

SUSAN

Yeah. 

GEORGE

Oh, I think that's fantastic. Good for you. Nice. That's very nice. 

SUSAN

So, what have you got there? 

GEORGE

Oh, I, uh-- 

SUSAN

Oh, ``Rochelle, Rochelle'' 

GEORGE

It's a foreign movie... a *film*, is what it is, actually. 

SUSAN

Yeah... A lot of nudity in that, huh? 

GEORGE

No, no, no... Just a *tiny* bit... It's not even *frontal* nudity. It's... *sidal* nudity... 

CLERK

Next. 

GEORGE

Oh, that's me. 

SUSAN

Alright, well... Good seeing you, George. 

GEORGE

Yes, good to see you, too. And Good luck with, uh... with the whole thing, there. 

CLERK

Uh, what are you returning? 

GEORGE

[embarrassed pause] ``Rochelle, Rochelle''. 

CLERK

Ah, ``Rochelle, Rochelle''... 'A young girl's strange, erotic journey from Milan to Minsk'... 

CLERK

Uh, that'll be, uh... $3.49. 

GEORGE

$3.49? It says $1.49. 

CLERK

Well, you didn't rewind it. There's a $2.00 charge for not rewinding. 

GEORGE

What! There's no signs here! This is an outrage! 

KRAMER

George, don't give him any money for that. It'll cost you less to keep it another day, rewind it and bring it back tomorrow. Don't give him the satisfaction. 

GEORGE

I'm not giving you the satisfaction. I'm gonna watch it again... 

JERRY

So, this morning I go down to the garage to check the car out. I figure by this time, the odour molecules have had at least twelve hours to de-smellify. I open the car door, like a *punch* in the *face*, the stench hits me-- it's almost as if it had *gained* strength throughout the night... 

ELAINE

Y'know I can think of at *least* six known offensive odours that I would *rather* smell than what's livin' in your car. 

JERRY

What about skunk? 

ELAINE

I don't mind skunk. 

JERRY

Horse manure? 

ELAINE

I *loooove* horse manure. 

JERRY

Well, I've never seen anything like this in my life. In fact, I went to the car wash, they want 250 dollars to detail it, and get the smell out. I'm not payin' for that. That's not my responsibility. In fact, I'm drivin' up to that restaurant now, and *demand* they pay for it. 

ELAINE

Absolutely. 

ELAINE

Listen, lemme ask you something. When you're with a guy, and he tells you he has to get up early, what does that mean? 

JERRY

It means he's lying. 

ELAINE

Wow... 

JERRY

Why? Is that what he told you? 

ELAINE

Yeah, last night. Oh, come on... Men *have* to get up early some time... 

JERRY

No. Never. 

ELAINE

Jerry! I'm *sure* I've seen men on the street early in the morning. 

JERRY

Well, sometimes we do actually have to get up early, but a man will *always* trade sleep for sex. 

ELAINE

Is it possible I'm not as attractive as I think I am? 

JERRY

Anything's *possible*... 

JERRY

What's the matter with you? 

KRAMER

Steinbrenner! He's ruinin' my life... 

JERRY

Oh yeah, Steinbrenner... 

KRAMER

I don't think I can take another season with him, Jerry. He'll just trade away their best young prospects, just like he did with Beuner, McGee, Drabek... McGriff... 

JERRY

I know the list... 

KRAMER

What's that smell? 

JERRY

What smell? 

KRAMER

Ooooh... You stink. 

JERRY

Whatd'ya mean I stink? 

KRAMER

You *stink*. Why don't you go take a shower? 

JERRY

I showered! Oh, wait a second... Since I showered, I've been in the car! 

ELAINE

So? 

JERRY

Don't you see what's happening here? It's attached itself to me! It's alive! 

ELAINE

If it attached itself to you, then... Oh, my God! That's why Carl said he had to get up early! Because I stink! Jerry, he thinks I have B.O.! Me! 

KRAMER

What happened? 

JERRY

What happened? My car *stinks* is what happened. And it's destroying the lives of everyone in it's path. 

GEORGE

What is that? B.O.? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

GEORGE

This is *unbelievable* B.O. 

JERRY

I know... I was at the car wash this morning and the guy told me in his 38 years in the business, he's never smelled anything like it. 

GEORGE

So, let me ask you. Do you think I could have done this? 

JERRY

No, no. It's the valet guy. 

GEORGE

No, no, I mean, driving Susan to lesbianism. 

JERRY

Oh... No, that's ridiculous. 

GEORGE

What if her experience with me *drove* her to it? 

JERRY

Suicide, maybe, not lesbianism. 

GEORGE

The woman she's 'lesbianing' with? Susan told me she's *never* been with a guy. 

GEORGE

Oh, this isn't even B.O.! This is *beyond* B.O.! It's *B*.B.O.! 

JERRY

There should be a B.O. squad that patrols the city like a 'Smell Gestapo'. To sniff 'em out, strip 'em down, and wash them with a big, soapy brush... 

GEORGE

Y'know, the funny thing is, somehow I find her more appealing now... It's like if I knew she was a lesbian when we went out, I never would've broken up with her. 

JERRY

Lemme see if I understand this... On second thought... 

JERRY

Here he is... that's the guy! (rolls up window) No, thank you, go back... go back... I'll park it! You go back! 

RESTAURATEUR

What do you mean-- 'stunk up'? 

JERRY

I mean the car *stinks*! George, does the car stink? 

GEORGE

Stinks. 

JERRY

Stinks! 

RESTAURATEUR

Well, perhaps *you're* the one who has the odour... 

JERRY

Hey, I've never smelled in my *life*, buddy! 

RESTAURATEUR

Really? Well, I smell you now. 

JERRY

That's from the car! 

RESTAURATEUR

Well, maybe *you're* the one who stunk up the car, rather than the car stinking up you! 

GEORGE

Oh, it's the chicken and the egg... 

JERRY

Thank you very much... Well, then go out and smell the car; see which smells worse. 

RESTAURATEUR

I don't have time to smell cars. 

GEORGE

Forget about smelling the car. Smell the valet. Go to the source... 

JERRY

You've gotta smell the car 

RESTAURATEUR

I'm a busy man 

JERRY

C'mon! One whiff! 

RESTAURATEUR

Alright, one whiff... 

RESTAURATEUR

Alright! I give up! I admit it! It stinks! Now will you let me out! 

JERRY

Alright, will you pay for the cleaning? 

RESTAURATEUR

Yes! 50 dollars! I'll give you 50 dollars! 

RESTAURATEUR

I'm not paying for *that*. They've already got my seven dollars... [sarcastically] '...erotic journey from Milan to Minsk'... 

CARL

The valet had such bad B.O.? 

ELAINE

Oh, man, just *rampant*, **mutant** B.O. The 'O' went from the valet's 'B', to the car, to me. It clings to everything. Jerry thinks it's an entity. But I showered and I shampoo'ed, so... 

CARL

That's a relief... 

ELAINE

What? 

CARL

It's still there... 

ELAINE

No, no, no! It *can't* be! I shampoo'ed! I rinsed! I repeated! 

GEORGE

Listen, I gotta ask you: I was a little concerned that perhaps I was responsible in some way for your, uh... metamorphosis. 

CLERK

That'll be $98.00. 

GEORGE

What $98.00? 

CLERK

That's what I said. $98.00. 

GEORGE

How could that piece of *crap* cost $98.00!? 

GEORGE

So, was it me? 

SUSAN

Oh, don't be ridiculous! Is that what you wanted to talk to me about? [Gives him the $35] Here. 

GEORGE

Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot. I'll pay you back. 

SUSAN

Yeah, *sure*... I gotta go. 

GEORGE

Listen. Let me ask you something. If you and Mona were ever to... dance, how do you decide who leads? I mean... do you take turns? Do you discuss it beforehand? How does that work? 

SUSAN

You're an idiot. 

GEORGE

Why? That's a *legitimate* sociological question. 

SUSAN

I'll see ya. And George, by the way... You stink... Real bad. 

GEORGE

It's not me! It's the car! 

MONA

I didn't think I'd come. 

KRAMER

I knew you would. 

MONA

Oh, Kramer! 

WASHER

We spray everything with Ozium-D, let it de-ionise, vacuum the spray out with a de-ionising machine. Hit it with high-pressure compressed air, and wet-dry vac it to extract the remaining liquids. We top it off with one of our seven air-fresheners, in your case, I would recommend the Jasmine, or the Potpourri. 

JERRY

Let's do it. 

HAIRDRESSER

The first thing we're gonna do is flush the follicles with the five essential oils. Then, we put you under a vapour machine, and then a heated cap. Then, we shampoo and shampoo and condition and condition. Then, we saturate the hair in diluted vinegar-- two parts vinegar, 10 parts water. Now, if that doesn't work, we have one last resort. Tomato sauce. 

ELAINE

Tomato Sauce? 

JERRY

Wait a minute! It still smells! It still smells! 

CARL

It still smells. 

JERRY

It still smells! 

GEORGE

How could it still smell after all that? 

JERRY

I don't know! 

GEORGE

Well, what are you gonna do? 

JERRY

I'll tell you what I'm gonna do, I'm selling that car! 

GEORGE

You're *selling* the car!? 

JERRY

You don't understand what I'm up against. This is a force more powerful than anything you can imagine. Even *Superman* would be helpless against this kind of stench. And I'll take anything I can get for it. 

GEORGE

Maybe I'll buy it. 

JERRY

Are you crazy? Don't you understand what I'm saying to you? This is not just an odour-- you need a *priest* to get rid of this thing! 

ELAINE

I still smell! 

JERRY

You see! You see what I'm saying to you? It's a presence! It's the beast! 

SUSAN

Kramer! Kramer! Kramer, open up, I know you're in there! 

JERRY

Susan! 

SUSAN

Kramer! 

JERRY

What is going on? 

SUSAN

You know what's going on? First, he vomits on me. Then, he burns down my father's cabin. And now, he's taken Mona away from me. 

GEORGE

He stole your girlfriend? 

SUSAN

Yes. She's in *love* with him. 

GEORGE

Amazing. I drive them to lesbianism, he brings 'em back. 

JERRY

That's the *least* of what you've accomplished... 

ELAINE

Wait a minute, wait a minute. Kramer, Kramer... Hold on a second. I don't get this. This woman has *never* been with a man her *entire* life-- 

KRAMER

I'm Kramer. 

GEORGE

I know what you're going through. Women. Who knows what they want? 

SUSAN

I just don't know what she sees in *Kramer*. 

GEORGE

Listen. You're beautiful. You're intelligent. You'll meet other girls... 

SUSAN

You think so? 

GEORGE

Yes, I know so. You happen to be a very eligible lesbian. 

SUSAN

You're very sweet... 

GEORGE

Hey, I know what I'm talking about. I gotta be honest with you, I gotta tell ya... Ever since I saw you holding hands with that woman, I can't get you out of my mind. 

SUSAN

Really? 

GEORGE

Yeah, you're just so... hip. 

GEORGE

Oh, my God... 

SUSAN

What? 

GEORGE

It's Allison. I dated her right after you. She's obsessed with me. 

ALLISON

George? 

GEORGE

Allison! Hi! Oh, my God! How are you? 

ALLISON

Good. You know, you owe me $50... 

GEORGE

Right. I don't have it on me. Allison, this is Susan. Susan, Allison. 

ALLISON

Nice to meet you... 

SUSAN

Nice to meet you... 

ALLISON

That's a beautiful vest... 

SUSAN

Thank you... 

KRAMER

I don't understand it. I was with her last night in my apartment; it was very romantic. Y'know with that fake wood wallpaper, the atmosphere is *fabulous* in there, now. It's like a ski lodge. 

SALESMAN

What year did you say this was? 

JERRY

'90. 

KRAMER

Anyway, we were on the couch, I move to hug her, next thing she tells me she's leaving; she's got to get up early. 

JERRY

That's strange... 

SALESMAN

How many miles you got on this thing? 

JERRY

23 000. 

KRAMER

And I was looking good, too. I had a nice, new shirt on, I'm wearing *your* jacket... 

JERRY

Wait a second... My jacket! I wore that in the car! The Beast! 

SALESMAN

I can't sell this car. 

JERRY

This... **thing**... has got to be stopped! 

HAIRDRESSER

So, what do you want to do? 

ELAINE

Sauce me. 

NOTE

The U.S. syndicated version of this episode features Jerry Stiller in the role of Frank Costanza. The sequences were re-shot in the spring of 1995. A role he didn't formally start until the next season in episode 66 'The Puffy Shirt'. 

JERRY

I have a friend who is about to get married, they're having the bachelor party and the bridal shower on the same day... So it's conceivable that while she's getting the lingerie, he'd be at a nude bar watching a table dancer wearing the same outfit. That is possible. But to me, the difference between being single and being married, is the form of government. You see, when you're single, you are the dictator of your own life. I have complete power. I can give the order to fall asleep on the sofa with the TV on in the middle of the day, no-one can overrule me! When you're married, you're part of a vast decision-making body. Before anything gets done there are meetings. Committees have to study the situation. And this is if the marriage works. That's what's so painful about divorce: you get impeached and you're not even the president! 

GEORGE

Hey, is it my imagination, or do really good looking women walk a lot faster than everybody else? 

ELAINE

We don't walk that fast... 

GEORGE

No seriously... 

ELAINE

Seriously, we don't. 

GEORGE

The better looking they are, the faster they go! I mean, I see they out there on the street, they're zooming around, like a blur. Like they have a motor on their ass. 

ELAINE

(Yelling to Jerry in the bedroom) Hey Jerry, come on, let's go. We're gonna miss the previews! 

ELAINE

Hey, how are we gettin' to Scott Drake's party on Saturday night? 

JERRY

Oh, Drake's party, I forgot to buy a present. 

GEORGE

I gotta buy a present now? 

ELAINE

Of course you do, it's an engagement party. 

GEORGE

It never ends, this present stuff! Engagement present! Then they get married, you gonna have to get them something for that! Then the baby, there's another present. Then the baby starts getting their presents. I don't even like Drake. 

JERRY

You don't like the Drake? 

GEORGE

Hate the Drake. 

ELAINE

I *love* the Drake. 

JERRY

How could you not like the Drake? 

GEORGE

Who's the Drake? 

ELAINE

'Who's the Drake'? 

JERRY

The Drake is good! 

ELAINE

So listen, what are you gonna get him? 

GEORGE

I haven't even met the fiancee! Whatever! (Leaves for washroom) 

JERRY

Elaine, look. I drew this triangle free-hand. It's a doodle. It's perfect! 

ELAINE

So what? That's easy. 

JERRY

Easy? 

ELAINE

Hi! Hey, have you gotten your present yet for the Drake? 

KRAMER

Uh, no, no, not yet. 

JERRY

Do you like the Drake? 

KRAMER

I *love* the Drake! I'm looking forward to meeting the Drakette! 

ELAINE

I'm lukewarm about the Drakette. 

KRAMER

(Looking at Jerry's doodle) That's a nice triangle... 

JERRY

It's Isosceles 

KRAMER

Ooh, Isosceles. I love the name Isosceles. If I had a kid, I would name him Isosceles. Isosceles Kramer. 

ELAINE

Hey, you know what, maybe we should all chip in for the gift. 

JERRY

The chip-in! 

ELAINE

Hey, a pretty good idea, huh? 

JERRY

Yeah! 

KRAMER

Yeah, the chip-in, defenitely! 

JERRY

You know what, let's go to that mall in Liberal(sp?) before we go to the party. We'll have to take your car, it's got the most room. 

KRAMER

No, no! My car's not running. 

JERRY

What about your father's car? 

GEORGE

No, no, no. Out of the question. I was over there today. He's got the good spot in front of the good building in the good neighbourhood. I know he's not gonna wanna move. 

JERRY

Are you serious? 

GEORGE

You don't know what that spot means to him. Once he gets it, he doesn't go out for weeks. 

JERRY

How about this, you put your car in the good spot, that'll hold the good spot in front of the good building, and we can get the good car! 

GEORGE

Good thinking! 

JERRY

Good to meet you! 

ELAINE

So what are we gonna get him? 

JERRY

We could get him anything we wanted, we're chippin' in. 

GEORGE

I like this area. I could live out here. 

KRAMER

Yeah, we ought to all get a house and live together. 

JERRY

Yeah, that's a good idea. I'll tell you what chuckles, I give you permission to sublet my room right now. 

GEORGE

Look at this. There's no spaces here. (to another car) Excuse me, are you gettin' out? 

CAR

No! 

KRAMER

Why don't you take a handicap spot... 

GEORGE

You think? 

ELAINE

No, no! We'll find a space. There's spaces in the other lot. 

GEORGE

I don't want to walk that far. 

ELAINE

What if a handicapped person needs it? 

KRAMER

Oh, come on, they don't drive! 

JERRY

Yes, they do! 

KRAMER

Have you ever seen a handicapped person pull into a space and park? 

JERRY

Well there's spaces there, they must drive! 

KRAMER

Well they don't. If they could drive, they wouldn't be handicapped. 

ELAINE

So if you can drive, you're not handicapped? 

GEORGE

Look, we're not gonna be that long anyway... we have to get to the 'party'! 

KRAMER

I got news for you: handicapped people, they don't even want to park there! They wanna be treated just like anybody else! That's why, those spaces are always empty. 

GEORGE

He's right! It's the same thing with the femenists. You know, they want everything to be equal, everything! But when the check comes, where are they? 

ELAINE

What does that mean? 

GEORGE

Yeah! Alright, I'm pulling in. 

KRAMER

Yeah, go ahead. 

ELAINE

George! 

GEORGE

Oh, come on, it's five minutes. 

KRAMER

Make sure we don't forget where the car's parked. 

ELAINE

Don't worry. We won't forget! 

JERRY

Do you believe the deal we got on this? A big screen TV? At that price? 

ELAINE

What a sale, huh? And how about that store, delivering it tonight? We're gonna be swimming in 'thank you's... 

GEORGE

What did I get the veggie burger for? You got a veggie burger, so I had to get the veggie burger, I'm allover crums... 

JERRY

No-one's gonna have a better gift than this big screen TV! Good for them, love the Drake! 

ELAINE

Got to *love* the Drake! 

JERRY

Hey, what's going on over here? 

ELAINE

Must have been an accident... 

JERRY

(to a woman) Hey, what's going on? 

WOMAN

Some jerk parked in a handicap spot, so this woman in a wheelchair had to wheel up this incline, and half way up her batteries gave up, and she rolled backwards into the wall. Taken her to St. Elizabeth's... 

JERRY

Is she OK? 

WOMAN

I don't know. We're just waiting here for the owner of this car to show up. May not get out alive! Thug! Taking up a handicap spot? He's gonna pay! 

JERRY

Son's of bitches! Good luck finding them... him... whatever. I'd like to stick around and get my hands on him myself, but I gotta take off. 

GEORGE

How are we gonna get out of here? They'll kill us! 

ELAINE

(to George) Are you happy now? 

KRAMER

Who would think these people we're gonna be here? 

JERRY

I don't know... 

ELAINE

What about the party? What about the Drake? 

GEORGE

Screw the Drake! 

JERRY

I love the Drake! 

KRAMER

Let's just take a bus back to the city. 

GEORGE

Can't leave the car here! 

KRAMER

Why not? 

GEORGE

It's my father's car! 

MAN

Let's smash it! 

EVERYBODY

Yeah! Yeah! 

JERRY

Let's get out of here. 

GEORGE

What are we gonna do? How are we gonna get out of here? 

JERRY

The thing is, even if we go back by the car, and there's nobody there, how do we know they're not all hiding, waiting for us? 

ELAINE

Well, they have to give up some time, they can't stay out there all night? 

JERRY

What are we, John Dillinger? How did this get to be the crime of the century? It's not like we stuck a broomstick in her spokes and she went flying... 

GEORGE

What I don't get is, just because the battery is dead, you think she'd be able to roll up the hill with her hands! 

KRAMER

You'd think... 

GEORGE

I mean, batteries have gone dead before, aren't they prepared for that? 

KRAMER

Most of them don't even have batteries. 

GEORGE

Must be one of those rich, spoiled handicapped people, who didn't want to do any work, and just wanted to sit in her wheelchair and take it easy. 

KRAMER

Yeah... 

GEORGE

Well, I'm sorry! 

ELAINE

Our big screen TV is probably arriving right now... 

GEORGE

How are we gonna get out of here? We need a plan! 

JERRY

I got it! (snaps his fingers) We give the keys to Elaine. 

ELAINE

Me? 

JERRY

Yeah! You're a woman! Men don't hit a woman! 

ELAINE

Oh, they won't? 

JERRY

Not if they don't know you... 

ELAINE

I'm not going for this, Kramer should go! It was all his idea! 

KRAMER

No chance in hell! 

JERRY

What if we created some sort of diversion? What if we all went by the car and started screaming: 'There he is, there's the guy that took the handicap spot!' And then, when they all run into the other direction, we'll jump in the car! 

GEORGE

That's good, we'll give it a try... 

ELAINE

That's good... 

JERRY

That doesn't work, we'll give 'em Kramer! 

KRAMER

Huh? 

JERRY

(as George picks up a broken piece of his car) You know, a lot of these scratches will buff right out... 

FRANK

Eight years have I had this car. Not a scratch on it! Eight years! 

FRANK

A beautiful Mercury! I special-ordered that bench seat! 

GEORGE

Dad, that other car cut us off! They had swastikas all over it... They were hurling racial epiphates at us... I could have been killed! 

ESTELLE

(to Frank) I told you not to give it to him! 

FRANK

(to George) You know, my insurance doesn't cover this? The whole thing is a total loss! 

LADY

Frank, the important thing is, he didn't get hurt! 

FRANK

No it isn't! 

LADY

So what are you doing now, Georgie? 

GEORGE

I'm uh... writing a pilot for NBC... 

FRANK

Where the hell is my paper? 

LADY

You're writing a pilot? 

ESTELLE

With his friend, Jerry Seinfeld... the comedian... 

LADY

So what's it about? 

GEORGE

Well, Jerry's car gets hit and the other driver doesn't have any insurance, so the judge 

LADY

This is the same situation! Frank, maybe you ought to make him your butler! 

ESTELLE

Every time you're with that Kramer, something happens... He's a real trouble maker! 

GEORGE

Nah, he didn't have anything to do with it... 

ESTELLE

He's all together crazy, that one! Jerry? I used to think was nice... I don't know what happened to him... 

JERRY

(to the Drake) So it was a good party, huh? Oh... you're welcome, you're welcome... (to Elaine) They loved the TV, *loved* it! 

ELAINE

Oh, yeah... 

JERRY

(to the Drake) Oh, wait a second, I'll ask her.. that's a great idea. (To Elaine) Drake wants to know if we want to come out to Minneolis this afternoon, since we missed the partly last night, to maybe get something to eat? 

ELAINE

Sure! 

JERRY

(to the Drake) Sure! ... Okay... Don't worry, I'm taking MY car! ... okay... okay, see you later... bye... 

JERRY

The Drake is great! 

ELAINE

Hmm.. he's so nice! I'm really happy for them. 

JERRY

Yeah. Well, I don't know if I'm happy for them, I mean I'm glad they're happy, but, frankly, that doesn't do anything for me. 

JERRY

Yes? 

GEORGE

It's me. 

JERRY

Come on up. 

KRAMER

Hey. I just came from St. Elizabeth's. 

JERRY

St. Elizabeth's Hospital? Why? 

KRAMER

Well, the handicapped woman? I went to see her. 

ELAINE

You went to see her? 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

JERRY

Wow, what happened? 

KRAMER

I'm in love. 

JERRY

What? 

KRAMER

Yeah, she is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. I love her Jerry, I really love her. I'm gonna ask her to marry me. She's got everything I've always wanted in another human being. Except for the walking. 

JERRY

Oh, what's the difference, you don't go out that much. 

KRAMER

Ah, I'm glad you're here. 

GEORGE

What? 

KRAMER

Alright, now, we gotta go out. We gotta buy a wheelchair. 

GEORGE

A wheelchair? What for? 

KRAMER

Well, you know I went to the hospital today, and I saw the woman, you know, and the wheelchair is totalled, we gotta get her another one! 

GEORGE

Doesn't she have collision? 

KRAMER

George, I'm in love with her! 

GEORGE

Well, my father works for the United Volunteers, maybe he can get her one. 

KRAMER

No! She needs it now! 

GEORGE

What about these two? Aren't they gonna chip in? 

KRAMER

Well... 

ELAINE

Hey, we told you not to park there! 

GEORGE

Can't we just fix the old one? 

KRAMER

Alright, alright. Fine George! Don't chip in! But some day, we're gonna be driving along, we're gonna look out the window, and see her crawling along 5th avenue! Is that what you want? 

GEORGE

Alright, alright! We'll buy her a wheelchair! Wheelchairs, engagement presents.. IT NEVER ENDS! 

SALESMAN

This is out best model. The Cougar 9000. It's the Rolls Royce of wheelchairs. This is like... you're almost glad to be handicapped. 

KRAMER

So now, what's this got? 

SALESMAN

Inductive joystick, dynamic braking, flip-up arms, it's fully loaded. I put Stephen Hawking in one of these two months ago, he's lovin' it! It's rated number one by Hospital Supply and Prosthetic Magazine. 

GEORGE

How much? 

SALESMAN

6200. 

GEORGE

Do you have something a little more... less expensive? 

ELAINE

Hey Drake! Hi Drake! 

ELAINE

My God this is fantastic! Tell me, were you guys just blown away or what? 

DRAKE

Oh yeah, yeah... it's fantastic... 

JERRY

I am gonna make good use of this! I'm watching every superbowl here, every big fight.... 

ELAINE

Oh man, there is nothing like a really big TV, huh? 

JERRY

So where're we eatin'? 

DRAKE

Well, actually... Jerry... 

ELAINE

I'm *really* hungry! 

DRAKE

... we just broke up... 

JERRY

When did this happen? 

DRAKE

About 20 minutes ago... Hey, I am really sorry about this guys... whew! 

JERRY

(looking at the TV) Look at the picture on this thing... 

ELAINE

Oh, cristal clear! 

JERRY

They know how to make 'em... 

ELAINE

Are there any good Italian restaurants around here? 

DRAKE

(through his sobbing) Gagliano's... that's pretty good... 

JERRY

Well... we should... 

ELAINE

Get movin'... 

JERRY

Yeah... Hey, Drake, what ever happens, I am sure it'll be for the best. 

ELAINE

Take it easy. Bye-Bye Alison! 

ELAINE

Oh, the remote! Okay, I'm just gonna put it on top of the television... 

SALESMAN

Alright, this one is about 8 years old. Not a scratch on it, it was owned by some lady who only used it to go from the bathroom to the kitchen and to feed her cat. 

KRAMER

But this'll get you around? 

SALESMAN

Oh sure, it just doesn't have any of the thrills of the Cougar. 

GEORGE

Like what? 

SALESMAN

For example, your tremor-damping. 

KRAMER

Now what's that? 

SALESMAN

It helps to control the direction regardless of the operator's tremors or spasticity. 

KRAMER

Well, is it alright if I try it? 

SALESMAN

Hop in! 

KRAMER

Oh yeah! 

SALESMAN

I tell ya... 

SALESMAN

When I see someone enjoying themselves like that, it reminds me why I got into this business in the first place. 

GEORGE

How much? 

SALESMAN

How about $240? 

KRAMER

We'll take it! 

ELAINE

Drake gave her the TV? 

JERRY

He gave her all the gifts; he felt guilty. 

ELAINE

Well, she can't keep it, it's not fair, that's *our* TV! 

JERRY

I know it is! 

ELAINE

Boy, I am really starting to dislike the Drake! 

JERRY

I hate the Drake! Maybe the whole thing was a scam. Anybody can just get engaged and get presents and just keep them all. Maybe they're on their way to Chicago tomorrow and do the whole thing all over again. 

ELAINE

They don't know anybody in Chicago. 

JERRY

Don't worry, they'll make friends fast with that nice TV. 

GEORGE

Hey. 

JERRY

Hey, guess what? The Drake broke up. 

JERRY

I don't know about defraying. 

GEORGE

Why? 

JERRY

We're not gettin' that TV. 

GEORGE

What do you mean? The engagement is off, we get the TV back. That's business. 

ELAINE

The Drakette took it. 

GEORGE

She can't take it. It's not hers, it's theirs. Once there's no theirs there's no hers, it should be ours. 

ELAINE

Well, she has it! 

GEORGE

(upset) I *told* you the Drake was bad! I hate the Drake! 

GEORGE

Maybe we should call her. 

ELAINE

Well, who's gonna call? 

JERRY

You are. 

ELAINE

What? Why is it me who always has to do these things? 

JERRY

Because that's your thing! 

ELAINE

What? Calling people I hardly know, and demanding they return expensive gifts, that's my 'thing'? 

JERRY

Yeah, that's your thing. 

ELAINE

Alright, gimme the phone... it's my 'thing'... 

JERRY

(to George) You know, I'm thinking about getting a yo-yo. 

GEORGE

Really? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

GEORGE

I could see that... 

ELAINE

Alison! Hi, this is Elaine... 

ELAINE

Oh, Okay... well thanks a lot... sorry again about you and the Drake... 

ELAINE

Everybody does. Bye-bye.... 

ELAINE

She gave it to charity. 

JERRY

Charity?!? That's apalling. 

GEORGE

How could anybody be so selfish and inconsiderate! 

KRAMER

Well, I gave her the wheelchair! You should have seen the look on her face. And then she told me, that the old wheelchair, that wasn't any good anyway! So you see George, the whole incident was a God blessing! Yeah! 

GEORGE

You mean a blessing in disguise? 

KRAMER

Yeah.... 

LADY

And I would also like to personally thank our gracious host Frank Costanza, who has earned the silver circle award and is our unanimous choice for the United Volunteer Representative of the Month! 

LADY

Due to his tireless effort, he personally raised over $22,000. That's a lot of wheelchairs! 

LADY

On behalf of the United Volunteers of Greater New York, we thank you! 

FRANK

Well... thank you very much! 

COP

Mr. Costanza? 

FRANK

Yes? 

COP

You're under arrest. 

FRANK

Under arrest? What for? 

COP

Reckless endangerment of public safety, and violation of traffic code 342-A. 

FRANK

What's that? 

COP

Parking in a handicap spot. Let's go... 

FRANK

George! George! 

JERRY

Your father got arrested? For what? 

GEORGE

Parking in a handicap spot. Right in the middle of his United Volunteers meeting. When he got back, he chased after me with a baseball bat. 

JERRY

Ho-ly! 

GEORGE

Between the car getting totalled, the towing charge and the fine, there's no way I can ever pay him back... 

JERRY

So what are you gonna do? 

GEORGE

I agreed to become his butler. 

JERRY

What? 

JERRY

What's the matter? 

KRAMER

It's over! 

JERRY

What's over? 

KRAMER

Me and Lola.... 

GEORGE

The woman we bought the wheelchair for? 

KRAMER

Yeah, she dumped me! 

JERRY

She dumped you? 

KRAMER

She dumped me! She rolled right over me! Said I was a hipster dufus. Am I a hipster dufus? 

GEORGE

(hesitatingly) ... no... 

KRAMER

Said I'm not good looking enough for her. Not good looking! Jerry, look at me, look at my face, huh, am I beautiful? George, am I beautiful? 

GEORGE

...you're very attractive... 

KRAMER

yeah... she says she doesn't wanna see me again. Told me to drop dead! 

JERRY

Drop dead? 

GEORGE

Boy, even I never heard that one... 

JERRY

She's pretty rough! 

KRAMER

Yeesh-jip! 

GEORGE

Well, we just blew 240 bucks on a wheelchair. 

JERRY

240 bucks? 

GEORGE

Well, it was slightly used... 

JERRY

Used? 

GEORGE

What!? 

FRANK

You're supposed to your face there! Do you see your face in there? 

FRANK

Yeah? ...oh really?...oh... how about that?... Right down a hill huh? Okay! Alight! Bye! 

FRANK

George, forget about the shoes. Want you to do something for me (scribbles something on a piece of paper). This handicapped woman had an accident. Somebody gave her a used wheelchair with defective brakes. 

GEORGE

Sons of bitches! 

FRANK

Anyway, I want you to pick up this big screen TV, and deliver it to her. 

GEORGE

Big screen TV? 

FRANK

Do you think you can handle it? 

ALLISON

Yes? 

GEORGE

Hi, we're from the United Volunteers, we've come to pick up the TV. 

ALLISON

Oh great, it's right over there. 

KRAMER

Ooh, it's a big one! 

GEORGE

Who's got the receipt? 

ELAINE

I do. 

GEORGE

Will they give us cash? 

JERRY

That's their policy. 

GEORGE

I hate this mall, there are never any spaces here... 

KRAMER

Why don't you park in front of the hydrant? 

GEORGE

What if there is a fire? 

KRAMER

What are the chances of that? 

NOTE

Originally broadcast as part of a 60 min episode. 

JERRY

To me, the whole concept of fear of success is proof that we are definitely scraping the bottom of the fear barrel. Are we gonna have to have AA-type meetings for these people? They'll go: 'Hi, my name is Bill, and the one thing I'm worried about is to have a stereo and a cream-colored couch.' According to most studies, people's number-one fear is public speaking. Number two is death. *Death* is number two! Now, this means to the average person, if you have to go to a funeral, you're better off in the casket than doing the eulogy. 

KRAMER

Why can't I play Kramer? 

JERRY

Look we've been through this already. You're not an actor! 

KRAMER

Neither are you. 

JERRY

I know. So why do we need two people in the show that can't act? 

KRAMER

Oh come on Jerry. How hard is it to act. You say something, I'll pretend it's funny. 

JERRY

My grandmother's in the hospital. 

KRAMER

Ha ha ha. Your grandmother's in the hospital! 

JERRY

This is real believable. 

KRAMER

What you didn't think I was really laughing? 

JERRY

It stinks. 

KRAMER

Let me see you do it. 

JERRY

Say something funny. 

KRAMER

Alright. I've never been to Mars but I imagine it's quite lovely. 

JERRY

Ah.......... 

KRAMER

Mine was better than that! Come on look. (starts to laugh again, Jerry too) 

GEORGE

Why are two pretending to be laughing? 

JERRY

We're acting. (they stop laughing) 

GEORGE

Oh, real good. (George makes a face like: you stink) Any word from NBC? 

JERRY

No. 

GEORGE

I don't understand. They're supposed to be casting this week. Something's wrong. Maybe they're not doing it. 

KRAMER

(to Jerry) Well at least let me audition. 

JERRY

(to George) He wants to play Kramer in the Pilot. 

KRAMER

(to George) Yeah! 

GEORGE

Out of the question. 

KRAMER

Oughh! 

GEORGE

(to Jerry) How could we not hear anything? What's with this Russel? What's he doing? (Jerry raises his arms and shoulders like: he doesn't know) 

RUSSELL

I really appreciate you coming. 

ELAINE

Oh, that's O.K. I don't have much time though. So... 

RUSSELL

All right, first of all, I want to apologize for all the phone calls. It's just--It's just-- (awkward pause) I don't understand, we went out once... 

ELAINE

That was two months ago. 

RUSSELL

Yes I know. I just-- I can't get you out of my mind. Ever since that-- that day in the restaurant when we met... (we see a flashback from 'The Shoes' of Elaine showing her cleavage and asking Russell for his Ketchup secret) 

ELAINE

Russell, you are the president of NBC. You can have any woman you want. (picks up the bowl of munchies on the table) 

RUSSELL

But I want you. 

ELAINE

God I hate these mixtures. Why don't they just put pretzels on the table. Even peanuts would be good, but I don't know how eats these cheesy things (she does). 

RUSSELL

Is it something I said... or did? 

ELAINE

Um... Look Russell... You're a very sweet guy. But I got to be honest with you. I don't like television... and that's your world. That's your life. I mean maybe if you were in... I don't know... Greenpeace or something, that would be different, but network television... I mean, come on, Russell, you're part of the problem. 

RUSSELL

Oh Elaine, we're doing some really very interesting things right now. We've got some very exciting pilots for next season. We have one with a bright young comedian, Jerry Seinfeld. 

ELAINE

Oh yeah, oh yeah. I've heard of him. He's that 'Did you ever notice this? Did you ever notice that?' guy. 

RUSSELL

Yeah. Anyway it's a ground breaking show. 

ELAINE

Really? What is it about? 

RUSSELL

(a little more enthusiast) Well, really, it's very unusual. It's about nothing. 

ELAINE

(surprised) What do you mean it's about nothing? 

RUSSELL

(starts doing George at the first meeting with NBC in 'The Pitch') For example, what did you do today? 

ELAINE

Um, I got up. Um, I went to work. Then I came here. 

RUSSELL

There's a show. that's a show. 

ELAINE

Russell, see, I'm really not interested in this stuff and I do have to go to work (she gets up). So... 

RUSSELL

(stops doing George, he's down again) Elaine, When--when--when are we gonna see each other again. 

ELAINE

I'm sorry Russell. I'm sorry O.K.? Bye-bye. (Russell, still sitting watches her leaving). 

JERRY

Hello? Yeah he's here. (to Kramer) Hey! It's for you. 

GEORGE

He's getting phone calls here now? (he's standing near the counter and eating chips out of a big bag) 

JERRY

(to George) Again with the sweat pants? 

GEORGE

What? I'm comfortable. 

JERRY

You know the message you're sending out to the world with these sweat pants? You're telling the world: 'I give up. I can't compete in normal society. I'm miserable, so I might as well be comfortable.' (George is baffled) 

KRAMER

(to the phone) Hold on a second I got another call. Hello? Yeah, he'll call you back. (Jerry and George look at each other) 

JERRY

(to Kramer) Who is it? 

KRAMER

That's NBC. 

JERRY

NBC!?! Give me the phone! 

KRAMER

I'm in the middle of a conversation here. 

JERRY

Get off the phone! 

KRAMER

(to the phone) Look, I'll call you back. (hangs up) 

JERRY

You know I'm waiting to hear from them. Who was it? 

KRAMER

Russell Dalrimple's secretary. 

JERRY

All right. Now you're doing something to help me. (to the phone) Hello yeah it's Jerry Seinfeld returning the call. Uh-huh.. O.K. great thanks a lot. (hangs up)(to George) Casting tomorrow at NBC. 4:00. We're in business baby, the pilot's on. You're gonna successful. (George looks disappointed) 

GEORGE

What if the pilot gets picked up and it becomes a series? 

DANA

That'd be wonderful George, you'll be rich and successful. 

GEORGE

Yeah, that's exactly what I'm worried about. God would never let me be successful. He'd kill me first. He'd never let me be happy. 

DANA

I thought you didn't believe in God? 

GEORGE

I do for the bad things. 

DANA

Do you hear what you're saying? God isn't out to get you George. What... What is that on your lip? 

GEORGE

What? 

DANA

It's like a discoloration. It's white. 

GEORGE

(gets up and picks a mirror) Yes. Yes, it's white. Why it's white. 

DANA

You'd better get that checked out. 

GEORGE

Better get that checked out? 

DANA

I would. 

GEORGE

What kind of a therapist are you? I'm telling I'm scared that something terrible is gonna happen to me, right away you start looking for tumors? 

DANA

I'm trying to help you. 

GEORGE

What are you like a sadist? No matter how bad somebody feels, you can make 'em feel worse. I bet you're rooting for a tumor. (pointing to her) 

DANA

I think you'd better go. 

GEORGE

Oh I'm going baby! I'm going! (he leaves) 

JERRY

Where? 

GEORGE

Right here. (showing his lip) 

JERRY

Get out of here, it's nothing. (Jerry knows George is hypochondriac. See 'The Heart Attack') 

GEORGE

(to the cab driver) Excuse me, do you see anything on my lip here? 

CABBIE

Yeah, it's like a discoloration. 

GEORGE

Oh, my God. 

CABBIE

Yeah, it's all white. 

GEORGE

(to Jerry) It's all white Jerry! It's all white! 

JERRY

Would you stop? 

CABBIE

I would get that checked out if I were you. 

GEORGE

Again with the checked out. I'm not going to the doctor. If I don't to the doctor, then nothing will happen to me. If I go he might find something. 

JERRY

If you go, maybe they'll catch it in time. 

GEORGE

Catch what in time? 

JERRY

Whatever it is. 

GEORGE

You think it's something? 

CABBIE

Ah! I hate these bums with their filthy rags. No no no, I don't want it, get away, get away from my car (he starts his wipers) 

JERRY

(to George) You know these squeegee-- Oh my God! It's crazy Joe Devola. 

DEVOLA

(through the opened window's cab) Good luck on the pilot Jerry. (the cab pulls away) 

STU

(to George) Yeah I think I see it. It's like a white discoloration. 

GEORGE

(to Jay) What do you think it is? 

JAY

It's like a... white discoloration. (we understand now why a sitcom needs so many producers) 

DIRECTOR

O.K. guys, are we ready to start? 

JERRY

Yeah, where is Russell? I thought he was gonna be here. 

STU

Oh you know I don't know. I saw him in the hall this morning, I said hello to him. He walked right past me. 

JAY

He must be worried about the fall schedule. 

STU

Ah, it's a real bear. 

GEORGE

Yeah. So what's going on? We're gonna shoot the pilot and then it's gonna be on TV the following week? 

STU

Yeah. Right. 

DIRECTOR

This is Mark Matts. He'll be auditioning for the role of George. (the guy looks very cool and casual, and has a lot of hair) 

MARK

Hey how you doing? 

JERRY

(thinking) They've gotta be kidding. 

GEORGE

(thinking) This guy's perfect. 

DIRECTOR

O.K. Let's read this. I'll be reading Jerry's part. 

MARK

Anyone call for Vandelay Industries? (George is the only one in the room to find Mark funny) 

DIRECTOR

No. Why? 

MARK

Listen to me. I told the unemployment office I was close to a job with Vandelay Industries and I gave them your phone number. So, when you answer the phone now, you've got to say: 'Vandelay Industries'. 

DIRECTOR

I'm Vandelay Industries? 

MARK

Right. 

DIRECTOR

What is that? 

MARK

You're in latex. 

DIRECTOR

What do I do with latex? 

MARK

I don't know, you manufacture it. 

DIRECTOR

This is Michael Barth. Another George. (he's in sweat pants, bald, with glasses) 

ALL

Hi Michael. How you doing? 

JERRY

Everything all right? 

MICHAEL

I just came from the podiatrist. I have a mole on my foot. I've got a little gangrene, they're probably gonna have to amputate. (everyone laugh except George) 

DIRECTOR

Any questions? 

MICHAEL

Yeah. What are we looking at here? Is this guy like a real loser? 

GEORGE

No, not a loser! 

DIRECTOR

Let's start with the second scene. You have it here? 

MICHAEL

A man gave me a, you know, massage. (everyone laugh except George) 

DIRECTOR

So? 

MICHAEL

Well, he-- he had his hands, you know, and uh, he was, huh, ... 

DIRECTOR

He was what? 

MICHAEL

He was you know... he was touching and rubbing. (loud laughter) 

DIRECTOR

That's a massage. 

MICHAEL

I think it moved. 

DIRECTOR

This is Melissa Shannon. 

MELISSA

Hi. 

ALL

Hi. How you doing. 

DIRECTOR

Melissa is reading for Elaine. 

MELISSA

It's like a bald convention out there! (she saw George) Sorry. I, uh, made a faux pas. 

JERRY

No you didn't. He knows he's bald. 

MELISSA

So how about that guy wearing sweat pants? I mean did he do that for the part or does he walk around like that? (Jerry approves with a nod, George drops his notepad on the coffee table) 

DIRECTOR

O.K. Shall we start? (Melissa and the casting director sit down) 

JERRY

(getting up) Uh, you know what? I'll read with her. 

MELISSA

Oh, great. 

JERRY

Alright, want to start? 

MELISSA

Yeah. 

JERRY

O.K. 

MELISSA

Ahem. What was that look? 

JERRY

What look? 

MELISSA

That look you just gave me? 

JERRY

I gave a look? 

MELISSA

Yes. 

GEORGE

Thank you! Thank you very much. (Jerry and Melissa stop and look at George) 

DIRECTOR

Let's see some more Kramers. 

ALL

Hi. How you doing? 

TOM

(to Jerry and very seriously) How you doing? 

JERRY

(smiling and surprised at the way Tom is talking) Good. 

DIRECTOR

What is this about? 

TOM

(standing) Levels. 

DIRECTOR

Levels? 

TOM

Yeah. I'm getting rid of all, all my furniture. All of it! I'm building... levels... with steps... completely carpeted... (making the gesture of carpeting steps) with pillows. (everyone laugh. He sits down) Like Ancient Egypt. 

DIRECTOR

I don't know how you're gonna be comfortable like that? 

TOM

Oh! I'll be comfortable. (laughter, applause. He gets up, goes to the coffee table) 

GEORGE

Very nice 

JERRY

Very good 

GEORGE

Very nice Tom, that was terrific. 

TOM

May I? (pointing the box of raisins) 

GEORGE

Sure. Thank you for coming in. (Tom eats some raisins) 

JERRY

(to George) It was a wonderful reading. 

GEORGE

Yeah. Really. 

TOM

Well, bye. 

GEORGE

Take care. Take it easy. (Tom leaves with the casting director) 

STU

Now, I thought he was really good, very funny. 

JERRY

Yeah, I liked him. 

GEORGE

What happened to the raisins? 

JAY

Yeah, there was a box of raisins there! 

GEORGE

Did he just steal the raisins? 

STU

You think he stole them? 

DIRECTOR

(enters with the real Kramer) This is Martin Van Nostrand. 

JERRY

(to Kramer) What are you doing here? 

DIRECTOR

You two know each other? 

STU

Wait a minute, I know you. You're the guy from the Calvin Klein underwear ads. 

KRAMER

That's true. 

KRAMER

(acting very bad) I saw Joe DiMaggio in Dinky Doughnuts again, but this time, I went in. (pause, stops acting) Oh! Uh, where's the bathroom? 

STU

I think if you go down the hall, it's on the right at the very end. 

KRAMER

Yeah. Be right back. (Kramer leaves) 

ELAINE

So who's playing Elaine? 

JERRY

Oh, don't worry about it. Very talented, very takented young actress. 

ELAINE

Really? 

JERRY

Yes. 

ELAINE

Who is it? 

JERRY

She's an eskimo, actually. 

ELAINE

Oh, my God (not in the mood to be kidding) 

JERRY

She came down from Juno by sleigh, she was in the Iditarod. Got to the finish line, just kept going. She's got the dogs with her in the hotel room. 

ELAINE

Listen, was Russell at the casting? 

JERRY

No, he didn't show up. 

ELAINE

You know, I'm a little bit worried about him. I don't understand. We had one date two months ago. Am I that charming and beautiful? 

JERRY

No. No you're not. 

ELAINE

Why do I keep setting you up? 

JERRY

I don't know. 

ELAINE

(to the waitress) Could we get a little more? (she doesn't listen and walks away) Aghh... You know ever since this new owner took over, the service here is *really* slow. 

JERRY

Yeah. Have you noticed anything else that's different since the new management? 

ELAINE

Mmm. They're putting a little lemon in the tuna. I love that. 

JERRY

Beside that. Look at the waitresses. 

ELAINE

Yeah? (we see that all the waitresses have big breasts) 

JERRY

What physical characteristic would you say is common to all of them? 

ELAINE

Ah... 

JERRY

I mean look at this. Every waitress working here has the same proportions. Wouldn't you say? 

ELAINE

Yes, I would say. 

JERRY

What's going on here. How is that possible? 

ELAINE

Do you think it's a coincidence? 

JERRY

No. I haven't seen four women like this together outside of a Russ Meyer film. 

ELAINE

(to the waitress) Hi. Excuse me. Who does all the hiring waitresses here? 

WAITRESS

He does. (pointing to the manager, Mr. Visaki) In fact we're looking for another girl if you know anyone. (she walks away) 

ELAINE

You know what? That's discriminatory. That is unfair. Why should these women have all the advantages? It's not enough they get all the attention from men, they have to get all the waitress jobs, too? 

JERRY

Hey that's life. Good-looking men have the same advantages. You don't see any handsome homeless. 

GEORGE

You see, It's right here. It's all white... 

DOCTOR

Oh yeah. Yeah. I've never seen this before. 

GEORGE

You've never seen this before? 

DOCTOR

I'm gonna have to take a biopsy on that. (George grabs the doctor's arm) 

GEORGE

(dramatically) A what? 

DOCTOR

A biopsy. 

GEORGE

A biopsy? 

DOCTOR

Yeah. 

GEORGE

Cancer? Is it cancer? Do I have cancer? 

DOCTOR

Well I don't know what it is. 

GEORGE

A biopsy! 

JERRY

What did he say? 

GEORGE

He said he didn't know what it was. 

JERRY

Alright. So? 

GEORGE

When I asked him if it was cancer, he didn't give me a 'get outta here'. That's what I wanted to hear: 'Cancer? Get outta here?' 

JERRY

Well, maybe he doesn't have a 'get outta here' kind of personality. 

GEORGE

How could you be a doctor and not say 'get outta here'? It should be part of the training at medical school: 'Cancer? Get outta here!' 'Go home! What are you crazy? It's a little test. It's nothing. You're a real nut. You know that?' (Jerry gives him half of his sandwich to hopefully shut him up) I told you that God would never let me be successful. I never should've written that pilot. Now the show will be a big hit, we'll make millions of dollars, and I'll be dead. Dead Jerry. Because of this. (showing his lip) 

JERRY

Can't you at least die with a little dignity? 

GEORGE

No I can't. I can't die with dignity. I have no dignity. I want to be the one person who doesn't die with dignity. I live my whole life in shame. Why should I die with dignity? 

JERRY

Hey. What happened to you yesterday? 

KRAMER

I got mugged. 

GEORGE

You got mugged? 

JERRY

Mugged? 

KRAMER

Well, I wouldn't have minded it so much but I was running home to go to the bathroom. 

JERRY

Why didn't you use the bathroom in the building? 

KRAMER

It was full. I tried a few other places, you know, but that didn't work. I mean it was an emergency Jerrry. I was really percolating... So I decided to run home through the park and then these two guys they stopped me and... 

JERRY

Yeah? 

ELAINE

It's me. 

JERRY

Come on up. 

KRAMER

But now I have a big problem, buddy. 

JERRY

What is it? 

KRAMER

Well, I waited so long I-- I missed my chance. 

JERRY

You didn't go? 

KRAMER

No. And now I can't get it back. 

JERRY

The % thing to do is just not think about it. 

KRAMER

How could you not think about it? 

ELAINE

Hey. 

KRAMER

(mumbles and leaves) 

ELAINE

What's the matter with him? 

JERRY

He's a little backed up. 

ELAINE

Oh... 

GEORGE

Elaine. 

ELAINE

So I spoke to some of my sisters about that coffee shop. 

JERRY

Oh, the sisters (he sits at the table) 

GEORGE

(to Jerry) Have you seen the waitresses in there lately? I never had so much coffee in my life. 

ELAINE

So we decided I should go over there and apply for a job myself. 

GEORGE

Apply for a job? What for? 

ELAINE

Because, it's discriminatory (she comes back wearing one of Jerry's shirts, untucked) 

GEORGE

It's a coincidence. 

JERRY

This is what you gonna wear? 

ELAINE

Yeah. 

JERRY

You're not gonna get the job. 

ELAINE

Exactly. 

JERRY

(to the phone) Hello. Oh, hi. Yeah I guess we could do that. At what time? All right. I'll see you there. O.K., bye. (hangs up) 

ELAINE

Who was it? 

JERRY

TV Elaine. She wants to get together and talk about the part. 

ELAINE

What about the dogs? 

JERRY

They're having sex in the hotel room. 

SANDI

So, the Elaine character is based on someone you know. 

JERRY

Yes. 

SANDI

And she's really your ex-girlfriend? 

JERRY

Uh, Huh, yeah. 

SANDI

I want to get to know her from the inside. What is she like? Tell me about her. 

JERRY

Well, she's fascinated with Greenland. She enjoys teasing animals, banlon, and seeing people running for their lives. She loves throwing garbage out the window, yet she's extremely dainty. 

SANDI

How would she eat a hamburger? 

JERRY

With her hands. 

SANDI

What about pasta? 

JERRY

Also with her hands. 

SANDI

Seriously... I want to experience everything she's experienced. 

JERRY

Everything? 

SANDI

Everything. 

JERRY

All right she cuts her pasta with a knife. 

SANDI

That's good. What's her favorite movie? 

JERRY

Shaft. 

SANDI

You got to get me a picture. What about sex? 

JERRY

She likes talking during sex. 

SANDI

Oh... dirty talking? 

JERRY

No. Just chitchat, movies, current events, regular stuff. You know Sandi-- (looking at his watch) 

SANDI

Elaine. 

JERRY

What? 

SANDI

Call me Elaine. 

JERRY

All right. Elaine. 

SANDI

How does Elaine kiss? 

JERRY

Well-- 

SANDI

Does she kiss... like this? (she kisses Jerry) 

JERRY

Actually she has a thing where she spirals her tongue around, it's like-- 

SANDI

Like this? (kisses again but with the spiral) 

JERRY

I think you got it. 

KRAMER

I like to eat spaghetti with just a fork. Because I can keep the strands long, and I can slurp it out to my mouth. Like this look. (faking to slurp spaghetti) Now sex, I like the bottom. Let them do all the work. You should be writing this stuff down... (waitress comes to take the order) Bran lakes...100%. I got a big problem. 

TOM

I'll have a hamburger. That's it. 

KRAMER

Yeah, that's good. Oh, now I like to play golf. 

TOM

This stuff doesn't matter to me. See, I'm gonna do the character like me, not like you. 

KRAMER

You gotta play him like me. I'm Kramer. 

TOM

I'm Kramer. 

KRAMER

Whoa, I'm Kramer. 

VISAKI

(foreign accent) What can I do for you? Would you like a table. 

ELAINE

No, I'd like to apply for a waitress job. 

VISAKI

(looks Elaine up and down) Have you ever waited on tables before. 

ELAINE

Oh yeah. I've been a professional waitress for the last 10 years. I've worked all over the city. These, uh, are my references. I'm sure you'll find that I'm more than qualified. 

VISAKI

I don't think I need anyone else right now. 

ELAINE

You're in big trouble mister. And I mean trouble with a capital 'T'. (she leaves) 

VISAKI

What? What did I do? 

ELAINE

Anyway there's at least four of them, and they're all huge. And one is bigger than the next. It's like a Russ Meyer movie. 

FRED

Who's Russ Meyer? 

ELAINE

Oh, he's this guy who made these terrible movies in the 70's with these kinds of women. He's obsessed. He's obsessed with breasts. That's hard to say. 

FRED

Anyway, go on. 

ELAINE

Um... Well, there's not really much more to tell. He was looking for waitresses, and I went in to apply for the job. And, he looked me up and down and he rejected me. 

FRED

(to a guy in the hall at the water cooler machine) Paul. Come in for a second. I want you to listen to this. 

PAUL

(to Elaine) Hi. 

ELAINE

Hi. 

FRED

Paul, woman here claims there's a restaurant on the West side that's only hiring large-breasted women. 

PAUL

(to Elaine) Really? 

NOTE

Originally broadcast as part of a 60 min episode. 

TOM

What do you mean made up? 

JERRY

It's made up. Haagen-Dazs is made up. It's not Danish. 

TOM

You're crazy. 

JERRY

No I'm not. (to Michael) George. Is Haagen-Dazs Danish? 

MICHAEL

What do you mean Danish? 

GEORGE

(to the guy next to him) This guy stinks. (speaking of Michael) 

JERRY

Danish. Is it from Denmark? 

MICHAEL

No, they make it in New Jersey. It's just a Danishy name. 

TOM

I can't believe that. They fooled *me* Jerry. 

RITA

(to Jay) Boy, talk about a show about nothing. (Jay, the integral producer, smiles stupidly) 

GEORGE

Uh, excuse me. (stopping them from rehearsing) Excuse me. (he walks to the guy's in charge of yelling: 'take #!') This--This is not right. May I? (the guy looks at George with a bothered face. George then walks up to Tom and takes him away from Jerry and Michael to talk to him in private)(to Tom) You see, you're going: 'They fooled *me* Jerry!' (George shakes his head with disapproval) You wanna hit 'fooled' more: 'They *fooled* me Jerry!'. You see the difference? 

TOM

I'm not gonna say it like that. 

GEORGE

Just a suggestion. (chuckles and walks back to the yelling guy) 

GUY

(with the same bothered face and while he's looking at George) All right everybody, take a five. 

GEORGE

(very casual and raising his hand in the air) Yep. That's five! 

JERRY

George? (walks away to talk privately. George, still casual, taps on Jerry's shoulder) I don't have a lot of experience with this acting stuff. But from what I can gather, they're a little touchy about being told how to say the lines. 

GEORGE

Why is that? 

JERRY

I don't know, but they don't seem to like it. By the way how am I doing? 

GEORGE

Oh, you're fine... you're fine. (looking at Tom in the back and then quieter to Jerry) So you think this guy playing Kramer took the raisins? 

JERRY

Why would he steal a box of raisins? 

GEORGE

Yeah, it's bizarre. (they both look around them suspiciously) 

RITA

(to Jay about Russell) What's with him? (to Russell) Russell? (louder) Russell? 

RUSSELL

What? 

RITA

You O.K.? 

RUSSELL

Yeah. No, uh, I was just thinking of something. I'll be back in a second. (he gets up and leaves) 

SANDI

What's the matter? 

JERRY

Nothing. 

SANDI

You're acting weird. Is anything wrong? 

JERRY

No. 

SANDI

Are you breaking up with me? 

JERRY

Are we going out? 

SANDI

You're breaking up with me, aren't you? (almost crying) 

JERRY

Do you want me to break up with you? 

SANDI

If that's what you want. 

JERRY

I don't even know what you're talking about. 

SANDI

Fine. Break up with me. 

JERRY

All right. We're broken up. 

SANDI

(little pause) Can we still be friends? (Jerry raises his head, staring ahead and wondering what's going on) 

GEORGE

Remember when you came to audition for us? 

TOM

Yeah. 

GEORGE

There was a box of raisins on the coffee table. Did you, by any chance, take them with you when left? 

TOM

What are you talking about? 

GEORGE

Well we were all eating the raisins. And I remember you--you were eating some of the raisins. And then you left, and the raisins were gone. And I was just wondering if, you know (chuckles), maybe you took them with you. 

TOM

Are you accusing me of stealing the raisins? 

GEORGE

Oh, no, no-- 

TOM

(angry) Why would I steal a box of raisins!? 

GEORGE

No you wouldn't. Nobody would. It's just that... they were missing, and... well I'm just inquiring. (chuckles nervously) 

TOM

Let me give you a word of advice. O.K.? I want you to stay away from me. I don't wanna talk to you, and I don't wanna hear anymore of your stupid little notes and suggestions. I don't like you. So if you got any other problems whether it's raisins, prunes, figs, or any other dried fruit, just keep it to yourself and stay out of my way, O.K.? 

GEORGE

Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. All right. I don't think we're gonna have any problem with that. (chuckles nervously) Good talking to you Tom. Really. 

RUSSELL

(nervously, almost desperately) Elaine. Elaine. What do you want? What can I do? Is it my job? Is that what it is? Elaine I can't go on like this. Will you call me? Would you call me? Well, why? All right. May I call you? Elaine? Elaine? (she hung up. An employee walks by, bumps into Russell and spills coffee accidentally on him) 

DAVID

Excuse me Mr. Dalrimple. I am so sorry. 

RUSSELL

All right. All right. What's your name? 

DAVID

David Richardson. 

RUSSELL

Get out! You're fired! 

DAVID

But Mr. Dalrimple-- 

RUSSELL

Don't talk back to me. Didn't you hear what I say? Get out! You want me to call the cops? I make and break little worms like you every day. Do you know how much money I make? Do you have any idea! Do you know where I live? I can have any woman in this city that I want. Any one. Now, GET OUT! (David leaves. Everyone on the set is looking at Russell) What are you all looking at? Go back to work! BACK! NOW! (they do, Russell leaves) 

GEORGE

The doc called and said the lab's backed up and now I'm not gonna get the results for another two days. 

JERRY

Ah! You're fine. There's nothing wrong with you. I'm the one who's dying. 

GEORGE

What do you mean? 

JERRY

Because I can't act! I stink! I don't what I'm doing! 

GEORGE

Come on you're... uh... you're fine. 

JERRY

This show's gonna ruin my entire career. I don't know how I got involved in this. 

GEORGE

What about me? I was a total failure. Everything was fine. Now this thing's gonna be a success and God's gonna give me a terminal disease. 

JERRY

This actress playing Elaine, she's out of her mind. 

GEORGE

The guy playing Kramer threatened me. 

JERRY

Why? 

GEORGE

'cause I asked him about the raisins. 

JERRY

You mentioned the raisins. 

GEORGE

Oh yeah. 

JERRY

Did he take 'em? 

GEORGE

I don't know. 

JERRY

Well if he didn't take 'em, what happened to 'em? 

GEORGE

That's what I'm trying to find out. 

JERRY

Hey. 

KRAMER

Hey. 

JERRY

Any luck? 

KRAMER

No. No, nothing. I got no... peristalsis. 

JERRY

What about bran? 

KRAMER

I tried bran-- 40%, 50% 100%. The bran isn't working for me. 

JERRY

Well my friend, (Jerry puts his hand on Kramer's shoulder) it may be time to consider the dreaded apparatus. 

KRAMER

Pfft! Hold it right there. If you're suggesting what I think you're suggesting, you're wasting your time. I am not Jerry, under any circumstances, doing any inserting in that area. 

JERRY

Oh, it's not that bad! 

GEORGE

Yes it is. 

ELAINE

Well it's all taken care of. I filed a report. An investigation is underway. 

JERRY

(to Elaine) So, you going to the taping tomorrow night? 

ELAINE

No. I don't think I should go. I really don't wanna bump into Russell. He called me the other day. He won't quit. 

JERRY

Oh, come on you gotta go! He's harmless. He's got a little crush on you. 

ELAINE

Jerry, this is not a crush. This is a complete fixation. he makes me very uncomfortable. 

JERRY

We need you there! 

ELAINE

(to Kramer) Hey are you gonna go? 

KRAMER

No. No. I'm gonna stay home. I want to be close to my home base in case there's any news from the front. (he leaves) 

SANDI

(to her hairdresser) No! Pick it up more in the front! It's got to be higher! Higher! Make a wall! A wall! 

DRESSER

Sandi, are you in wardrobe? Sandi? 

JERRY

Try Elaine. 

DRESSER

Elaine? 

SANDI

Yes? 

WILTON

Elaine? It's me-- Wilton Marshall. Remember? Camp Tioga-- 1978? Remember? 

ELAINE

Oh, right. 

WILTON

Wow! You know you haven't changed a bit. 

MICHAEL

I can't remember my lines!!! 

JERRY

Just relax, you'll be fine. 

MICHAEL

I can't relax. I don't know what line! I don't know any of 'em! 

JERRY

You're just like George. George'd do the same thing. You're just like him. It's amazing! 

MICHAEL

Help me Jerry! Help me! 

RITA

(to Stu) Where is Russell? 

STU

You know I don't know. I thought he was coming. I assumed he wouldn't miss it. 

JAY

He hasn't been well. 

STU

(to Rita) Can I tell you something in confidence? I think it's a woman. 

RITA

How pathetic. 

GEORGE

This is George Costanza, I'm calling for my test results. Negative? Oh, my God. WHY! WHY! WHY? What? What? Negative is good? Oh, yes of course! How stupid of me. Thank you. Thank you very much. (he hangs up) 

GEORGE

(he walks casually to Tom, and taps his arm) Listen. I know we've had our problems in the past, but we got a show to do tonight. Time to pull together as a team. Life's too short. I say, let's let bygones be bygones. If you took the raisins, if you didn't take the raisins-- They weren't even my raisins. I was just curious because it seems like a strange to do to walk into a room, audition, and to walk out with a box of raisins. Anyway, whatever. If you ever want to tell me about it, the door to my office is always opened. In the event that I get an office. You'll come in, we'll talk about the raisins. We'll have a nice laugh. 

TOM

How would you like it if I just pulled your heart out of your chest right now, and shoved it down your throat? 

HAZELL

Are you ready to meet our cast? (crowd applause) All right. 

JERRY

Good evening, folks. How you doing? (small reaction from the crowd) Well, you sound like a great crowd. We have a show we're gonna put on for you tonight. It's a new TV show. It's what they call a pilot. And we hope it becomes a series. It's called 'Jerry', and I'm playing Jerry-- 

DEVOLA

(getting up then shouting) SIC SEMPER TYRANNIS! (he jumps over a balcony and on the stage. The crowd is yelling) 

GEORGE

Sic semper tyrannis? What is that, Latin? 

JERRY

Yeah, it's what John Wilkes Booth yelled out when he shot Lincoln. 

GEORGE

Really? What does it mean? 

JERRY

It means: 'Death to tyrants'. 

GEORGE

I can see that. 

ELAINE

See, now this is exciting! This is exciting! Did I miss anything already? 

JERRY

No, it starts in five minutes. You were there at the taping, what's the big deal? 

ELAINE

Nah, now it's on TV. It's different. I told everybody I know to watch it. 

GEORGE

Yeah, me too. 

JERRY

Hey, what about Russell? Did you hear from him? 

ELAINE

No. 

JERRY

Strange. Even not showing up at the taping... 

KRAMER

Hey, pistol-packin mama, you swing that gal around, Allemande left with the old gray hag, around and around you go. Yee-ha!! 

JERRY

Well, well, well. 

ELAINE

Congratulations. 

KRAMER

Well, thank you. 

GEORGE

You went for the big 'E'. 

KRAMER

Wet and wild. 

JERRY

All right. Come on sit down. It's about to start. 

KRAMER

Oh, yes. 

ELAINE

Hey, what's this? Look. A wallet. 

JERRY

A wallet? Let me see that. 

ELAINE

Here. 

JERRY

Ah, man! It's my father's wallet! The one he thought they stole at the doctor's office that time. 

GEORGE

Shh! This is it! 

JERRY

How do you like that? 

ELAINE

Bravo! 

GEORGE

You hurt me. 

MICHAEL

Hey. 

JERRY

Hey George. 

MICHAEL

New sneakers? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

MICHAEL

What do you need new sneakers for? 

JERRY

I like sneakers. 

MICHAEL

How do you make a decision which one to wear? I'd go crazy if I have to decide which sneakers to wear every day. 

JERRY

Nah, you're crazy anyway. 

ALLSION

(to each other while they recognize one of George's behaviors in Michael) George! 

SID

What kind of stupid show is this? Hey! It's that idiot that took all my records! (the houskeeper starts laughing) 

MARLA

John, what are you doing? Come back to bed. 

JOHN

(with a Boston accent) This show looks interesting. Isn't he that Seinfeld fellow you went out with? 

MARLA

Ooh, he's horrible! Horrible! 

JOHN

Nevertheless... 

DRAKE

Ah, that Jerry's a funny guy. Huh? Got to love the Sein! 

ALLSION

Hate the Sein! (while she adjusts the tiny antenna) 

PING

I can't believe you liked him. 

CHERYL

I thought he was dark and disturbed. 

PING

Real perceptive. 

DONALD

This is a piece of crap! 

MOTHER

Donald, you used to like him. 

DONALD

What a sellout! Give me that remote! 

MEL

No, Donald. 

KRAMER

Come on Jerry, the commercials almost over. 

JERRY

All right. 

ELAINE

You know Jerry I really like this guy who's playing the butler. 

JERRY

Oh yeah. He's good. You know he's John Ritter's cousin. 

ELAINE

Really? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

JERRY

Hello, Charles. 

CHARLES

Hello. So, where do you want me to start today? 

JERRY

Why don't you start in the bedroom? 

CHARLES

(to himself, upset) Start in the bedroom... 

TOM

Hey. 

JERRY

Hey. The butler's here. 

TOM

He is? Listen. When he's finished, send him over to my house. 

JERRY

I'm not sending him to your house. 

TOM

Why not? 

JERRY

Because the judge decreed he'd become my butler, not my friend's butler. 

TOM

Jerry, he is your butler. You can give him any order you want. That's what butlers do. 

JERRY

But I don't want to. 

KRAMER

Jerry, my house is a pigsty, come on. 

JERRY

Yeah? 

SANDI

(from the buzzer's speaker) It's Elaine. 

JERRY

Come on up. 

CHARLES

I need more Pledge. 

JERRY

More Pledge! I just bought two cans last week and I don't even have any wood in the house! 

CHARLES

Well, it goes fast. 

SANDI

(to Charles, very friendly) Hello. 

CHARLES

Hello. (he goes back in the bedroom) 

JERRY

What's all this about? 

SANDI

We had a date. 

JERRY

You had a date? You went out with my butler? Who said you could go out with my butler? 

SANDI

Why do I need your permission? 

JERRY

Because he's my butler! 

MORTY

That's terrific! 

HELEN

How could anyone not like him? 

TIA

But he picks his nose. 

BASS

He's a member of our health club. Isn't he? 

SIDRA

Yeah... 

BASS

You know that Kim Novak has some big breasts? 

JERRY

Ever notice a lot of butlers are named Jeeves? 

JERRY

You know I think when you name a baby Jeeves, you've pretty much mapped out his future, wouldn't you say? Not much chance is gonna be a hitman I think after that. (with a British accent) 'Terribly sorry Sir, but I'm going to have to whack you'. 

ALL

(applauding and shaking hands) Wooh! Yeah! 

ELAINE

Wow! That was great! That show was so funny. It was really funny. I'm not just saying that cause I know you. Honestly. 

JERRY

Let's go out and celebrate! (they all get up) 

ELAINE

That was so good. 

JERRY

Come on let's eat something. (phone rings) 

ELAINE

You know what I think this thing is gonna get picked up George. You guys are gonna be rich! 

GEORGE

Do you really think so? 

ELAINE

Oh yeah. 

GEORGE

And God didn't kill me. 

JERRY

(to the phone) Hello? 

RITA

Hi Jerry, this is Rita Kierson. 

JERRY

Oh, hi Rita. 

RITA

I'm calling to let you know that Russell Dalrimple is no longer with this network. 

JERRY

Oh, my God. Did he get fired? 

RITA

To be honest with you. Nobody really knows. He seems to have disappeared. 

JERRY

Russell's disappeared? 

RITA

In any event, I've been made the new president of NBC. As you may or may not know, Russell and I did not see eye to eye on many, many projects. And as my first order of business, I'm, uh, passing on your show. 

JERRY

You're passing already? But the show just ended two minutes ago! 

RITA

Well, I just got the job. Goodbye, Jerry. 

JERRY

Yeah, see ya. (he hangs up) 

ELAINE

What-- What are you looking at me for? 

GEORGE

It was you! 

ELAINE

What did I do? 

JERRY

Do you realize his obsession with you cost us a TV series? 

ELAINE

I didn't know that he'd fall for me and I'd drive him insane. I mean, you know, that's not my fault. 

GEORGE

Yes it is! You're very charming! 

ELAINE

I can't believe this? What happened to him? Where the hell is he? 

JERRY

No one knows. 

RUSSELL

She works for Pendant Publishing. She's the most beautiful woman I've ever seen. You know, I used to work for NBC, but when I go back to her this time, she'll respect me. 

RAFT

You'd better get down. They might start firing soon. (harpoon fires) 

JERRY

Hey look at this. What is going on here? 

GEORGE

Well, well, well. 

ELAINE

Nothing has changed. How did this happen? (she sees the two guys of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission at a table) Ah, these are the two guys I talked to at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Hey! What are you two guys doing here? I thought you were gonna do something about this. Now you're eating here? 

FRED

Oh no. That's why we're here. We're checking things out. 

PAUL

Yeah, we're checking it out. 

ELAINE

(to Paul) You're checking it out? 

MAN

(to Fred and Paul) See you back at the office, guys. 

VISAKI

Fred, Paul, lunch and dinner? Boy, you guys ought to move in. How about a piece of pie on me? Sophia! Take care of these fellows. 

ELAINE

(to the manager) Hey! Come here a second. I want you to know something. You are not gonna get away with this! 

VISAKI

Get away with what? 

ELAINE

Ah, 'with what?' You know what. With the waitresses. How they're all... alike. 

VISAKI

Of course they're alike. They're my daughters. 

ELAINE

(embarrassed, but smiling) Oh, your daughters. 

GEORGE

You must be very proud Mr. Visaki. (shaking his hand) And may I say sir they're lovely girls, absolutely lovely girls. It's nice to see such fine upstanding women in gainful employment, Mr. Visaki. 

VISAKI

Oh, here's a table for you. 

GEORGE

A table right here. 

VISAKI

Peggy! 

GEORGE

Peggy! (they all sit) His daughter Peggy. Peggy's coming over to serve. 

JERRY

What a family! 

VISAKI

My daughter Peggy. 

GEORGE

Ah! Peggy. Good to see you. 

ELAINE

Hi Peggy. 

GEORGE

Thank you very much. (Peggy leaves the menus and walks away) So guess what I got do tomorrow? 

JERRY

What? 

GEORGE

Start looking for a job. 

KRAMER

You know what you ought to do George? You should work for Greenpeace. You those people they attack the whalers out on the open sea. 

GEORGE

Are you crazy? You take your life in your hands with those nuts. 

MAN

Keep fighting matey! Get your head above the water! I've got you matey! I've got you! Matey! (he loses the rope) I'll remember her name! Elaine Benes! I'll write to her. I'll tell her all about you and what you did out here! Goodbye, matey! Goddbye! 

JERRY

So, what's her name? 

GEORGE

Karen. 

JERRY

Is she nice? 

GEORGE

Great. 

JERRY

So you like her? 

GEORGE

I think so. 

JERRY

You don't know? 

GEORGE

I can't tell anymore. 

JERRY

Well do you feel anything? 

GEORGE

Feel? What's that? 

JERRY

All right, let me ask you this: when she comes over, you're cleaning up a lot? 

GEORGE

Yeah. 

JERRY

You're just straightening up or you're cleaning? 

GEORGE

Cleaning 

JERRY

You do the tub? 

GEORGE

Yeah. 

JERRY

On your knees, Ajax, hands scrubbin', the whole deal? 

GEORGE

Yeah, yeah. 

JERRY

Okay, I think you're in love! 

GEORGE

Tub is love? 

JERRY

Tub is love. 

GEORGE

Hah. 

JERRY

So there you are. You've got a nice girl and a clean apartment. 

GEORGE

Yep. There's one liiiittle problem. 

JERRY

Sexual? 

GEORGE

Yeeeaaah. (Jerry and George lean in to make their conversation a little more private) Well..... I've never really felt confident in uh..... one particular aspect. 

JERRY

Below the equator? 

GEORGE

Yeah. 

JERRY

Nobody does. You know, nobody knows what to do. You just close your eyes and you hope for the best. I really think they're happy if you just make an effort. 

GEORGE

I-I don't know. Last time I got the tap. 

JERRY

You got the tap? 

GEORGE

You know, you're going along, you think everything's all right and all of a sudden you get that tap. (George taps his own shoulder). You know it's like pfffff (whistling sound), all right that's enough, you're through. 

JERRY

The tap is tough. 

GEORGE

It's like the manager coming out and asking you for the ball. 

JERRY

Well maybe she just wanted to move on to other business. 

GEORGE

No, no, this wasn't moving on. I got the hook. I wish I could get a lesson in that. 

JERRY

It's a very complicated area. 

GEORGE

You can go crazy trying to figure that place out. 

JERRY

It's a haaazy mystery. 

GEORGE

Anyway, I think everything else is okay. Unless of course she's faking. 

ELAINE

Who's faking? 

GEORGE

Nothing. 

ELAINE

Faking what? 

GEORGE

Nobody's faking. 

ELAINE

Ah! Orgasm? 

GEORGE

She's not faking! 

ELAINE

How do you know? 

GEORGE

I know. I can tell. It's one of my powers. Why, did you ever fake? 

ELAINE

Of course. 

JERRY

Really? 

GEORGE

You faked? 

ELAINE

On occasion. 

JERRY

And the guy never knows? 

ELAINE

No. 

JERRY

How can he not know that? 

ELAINE

Because I was gooood. 

JERRY

I guess after that many beers he's probably a little groggy anyway. 

ELAINE

You didn't know. 

JERRY

What? 

ELAINE

You didn't know. 

JERRY

Are you saying... 

GEORGE

I think I'll have a piece of cake. 

JERRY

With me? 

ELAINE

Well... 

JERRY

You faked with me? 

ELAINE

Ye. 

JERRY

You faked with me? 

ELAINE

Yeass. 

JERRY

No. 

ELAINE

Yeass. 

JERRY

You faked it? 

ELAINE

I faked it. 

JERRY

That whole thing, the whole production, it was all an act? 

ELAINE

Not bad huh? 

JERRY

What about the breathing, the panting, the moaning, the screaming? 

ELAINE

(points in the air as is to point out each things Jerry asked) Fake, fake, fake, fake. 

JERRY

I'm stunned, I'm shocked! How many times did you do this? 

ELAINE

Uuuhm, all the time. 

JERRY

All the time?! 

GEORGE

We got a chocolate malt in here! 

JERRY

But I'm so good. 

GEORGE

I'm sure you are. 

ELAINE

Jerry, listen, it wasn't you. I just didn't have 'em back then. 

JERRY

She faked. 

JERRY

Maybe they've all been faking. 

ELAINE

I'm sure they're not. 

GEORGE

Maybe Karen is faking. 

KRAMER

She was probably joking. 

JERRY

No no, it was no joke. 

KRAMER

She didn't have any? 

JERRY

No. None. 

KRAMER

(raising hand) She faked 'em all. 

JERRY

(raising hand) Faked 'em all. 

KRAMER

Well so she faked 'em, so what? 

JERRY

The woman had an orgasm under false pretences. That's sexual perjury. 

KRAMER

You know I heard her screaming from my apartment? She woke me up a few times. 

JERRY

How did she do it? She's like Meryl Streep this woman. And I had to work the equipment. I'm not unskilled, I'm in the union. If she'd at least told me, maybe I could have done something about it. 

KRAMER

Yeah I could have helped you out. 

JERRY

What could you have done? 

KRAMER

I could have given you some pointers. I know how to press those buttons buddy. 

JERRY

I'm feeling very inadequate about the whole thing. 

KRAMER

Aaaaah. 

JERRY

Don't aaaaah! I'm supposed to do something with her later? I don't even think I wanna see her. 

KRAMER

Giddy-up. 

JERRY

Hello... Oh hello Elaine. 

ELAINE

So we're having dinner tonight? 

JERRY

I don't know, I'm not really in the mood. 

ELAINE

Why? What's wrong? You're not still thinking about this afternoon are you? 

JERRY

What, the grilled cheese? Naaah, they always burn the toast. 

ELAINE

Nooo, the other thing. 

JERRY

Oooh that. Well... 

ELAINE

Oh come on, Jerry. Making to much of a big deal about it. 

JERRY

Yeah I guess. So you wanna meet at that place at seven thirty? 

ELAINE

Okay. 

JERRY

All right. 

ELAINE

All right, see you later. 

JERRY

Bye. 

ELAINE

Bye. 

ELAINE

Rene, can you come here a second? Let me ask you something: Ummm, have you ever... you know... faked it? 

RENE

Yeah, sometimes. 

ELAINE

Really, like when? 

RENE

Like if we went to a Broadway show, if we had really good seats. (Elaine is sitting there, jaw opened shaking her head yes) Well you know, if it's enough all ready and I just wanna get some sleep. 

JERRY

I really don't feel like seeing her. 

KRAMER

You know, I faked it. 

JERRY

(confused) What?! 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

JERRY

You faked it? Why would you do that? 

KRAMER

Well you know, if it's enough already and I just wanna get some sleep. 

JERRY

Yeah, but why would you... (Kramer is eating a peach then disgusted he spits it out) Bad peach? 

KRAMER

It's terrible! 

JERRY

Did you get that at Joe's? 

KRAMER

Yeah, of course I got it at Joe's. 

JERRY

That's surprising, his fruit is usually the best. 

KRAMER

You know what I'm gonna do? (heading for the door) I'm gonna return this. 

JERRY

You're returning used fruit? 

KRAMER

Jerry this peach is sub par. 

JOE

So what do you want me to do? 

KRAMER

I want restitution. 

JOE

Restitution? You want restitution? Why should I give you restitution? 

KRAMER

Because it's no good. 

JOE

When you put that fruit out, that's where it ends for me. 

KRAMER

It's still your fruit, you gotta stand behind your fruit. 

JOE

I stand behind my fruit. 

KRAMER

So... 

JOE

Hey, you got a bad peach? That's an act of God. He makes the peaches. I don't make the peaches, I sell the peaches. You have a problem? You talk to him. 

KRAMER

You know this whole place is going vrrrrrrrrrrrrt, downhill. I could have come in here last week with a bad plum but I let it go. 

JOE

Well let me put a solution for ya: do your business elsewhere, I don't want your business. 

KRAMER

Oh now you don't want my business. 

JOE

No, I don't want your business and from this moment you're banned from the store, you're banned! 

KRAMER

But what am I gonna do for fruit? 

KAREN

(moaning) Mmmmm, Mmmm, Hmmhmmhmmm (lights a cigarette) Mmmm (takes a puff) Woo 

GEORGE

(thinking of the moans) Heh. (Karen takes another puff of her cigarette) You seem like you really enjoyed your Risotto. (chuckles) You have a very contented air over there. (chuckles again) You look very contented, very satisfied. (pauses) Are you satisfied? 

KAREN

I'm very satisfied. 

GEORGE

I-I'm sure if you weren't satisfied you would probably say something wouldn't you? 

KAREN

I probably would. But then again I'm an enigma. 

GEORGE

Hey listen... umm, instead of the movie... uh, maybe we'll go back and uh you know...(nudges her head with his head) 

KAREN

Maybe. 

GEORGE

So... uh you feel okay about that whole thing... what we do in there... you're generally okay with everything in there? 

KAREN

Generally. 

GEORGE

Do you uh feel the way you feel after the Risotto? 

KAREN

Well no, I feel full after the Risotto. 

GEORGE

Yeah...(scratching his head) full. 

ELAINE

Oh god, Mmmm, Mmm, Mmm, Mmmmm, Mmm, Ah, Woo 

JERRY

Satisfied? 

ELAINE

Mmm, hey, you know what? You wanna go see that new Meryl Streep movie? 

JERRY

Meryl Streep? 

ELAINE

You don't like her? 

JERRY

Ah, she's okay. 

ELAINE

I love her Jerry, she's so authentic. I really believe everything is actually happening to her. There's no acting there. 

JERRY

Yeah. You don't want coffee or anything do you? 

ELAINE

I really admire actors, you know. It's just such an incredible skill. 

JERRY

Yeah, yeah, can we get off of this? 

ELAINE

What's the matter? 

JERRY

Nothing. 

ELAINE

You're not still thinking about that are you? 

JERRY

Nooo. 

ELAINE

Oh good. 

JERRY

Give me another shot! 

ELAINE

(shocked) What? 

JERRY

Another shot, I want another shot. 

ELAINE

You mean...? 

JERRY

Yes! 

ELAINE

Oooh no, I don't think so. 

JERRY

Come on! One shot, I can do it, I know I can do it! 

ELAINE

Jerry, we're friends! We can't do that, it would ruin our friendship. 

JERRY

Oh friendship... friendship, shmanship . 

ELAINE

Jerry no, that's important to me. 

JERRY

We won't ruin the friendship. 

ELAINE

Ya, Yes we will! 

JERRY

Elaine... 

ELAINE

No Jerry, it is out of the question. You know what sex does to a friendship, it kills it. 

JERRY

A half hour, give me a half our. 

ELAINE

No! 

JERRY

Okay, fifteen minutes. I guarantee you fifteen minutes, I can make it happen! 

ELAINE

Noo! 

JERRY

You're worried I'll be able to do it aren't you? 

ELAINE

What, no, it doesn't matter. Jerry, I don't care. 

JERRY

That's it, that's it. You like having this over me, you don't want me to do it. 

ELAINE

That is so ridiculous. 

JERRY

Come on, Elaine! 

ELAINE

No. 

JERRY

Elaine?! 

ELAINE

No! 

GEORGE

It's Jerry's fault. 

KAREN

Jerry? 

GEORGE

Jerry and Elaine. They made me nuts. 

KAREN

Oh I don't care, George, really it's all right. 

GEORGE

So you feel okay? 

KAREN

Well, it's not like after the Risotto. 

JERRY

Well good night. 

ELAINE

I still don't understand why we had to walk out on that movie. 

JERRY

Oh that Meryl Streep, she's such a phony baloney. 

ELAINE

Goodnight. Thanks for a really fabulous evening (sarcastic). 

JERRY

Oh what, you're upset? 

ELAINE

Yes I'm upset, can't you tell? 

JERRY

No I can't, maybe you're faking. 

ELAINE

I'm really, really sorry I told you that. 

JERRY

I'm sorry too. 

ELAINE

Well stop being such a baby. 

JERRY

You're a baby! 

ELAINE

You're a baby! 

GEORGE

It's all your fault! You and Elaine! All that orgasm talk. She did have an orgasm, she didn't have an orgasm. Orgasm this, orgasm that. I got so focused on it. I started to panic and boom, I lost it. I tried everything, I was talking to him: 'Please wake up, do something.' 

JERRY

They're mysterious little fellows aren't they? 

GEORGE

I hate him! 

JERRY

You know it happens to everybody. It happened to Houdini. And he could get out of a trunk under water with his hands in chains! But he had a problem with that. The miracle is that it ever happens. 

GEORGE

It's like a magic trick. Sometimes I think it would be easier to bend a spoon mentally than to make that transformation. 

KRAMER

Hey. 

JERRY

Hey. 

KRAMER

Hey listen, if I give you money would you go out and get me some fruit? 

JERRY

Why can't you get it? 

KRAMER

Well I got banned from the store I can't go back in there now. 

JERRY

What happened? 

KRAMER

Well you know, we had a fight over the peach and uh well Joe doesn't want my business. 

GEORGE

Hey, was that a joke about Houdini? 

JERRY

(to George) No. (to Kramer) I told you not to say anything. 

KRAMER

Jerry, what am I gonna do for fruit? 

JERRY

Well you'll have to go to the supermarket. 

KRAMER

The supermarket? That's impossible! They don't have a decent piece of fruit at the supermarket. The apples are mealy, the oranges are dry. I don't know what's going on with the Papayas! Jerry you gotta go to Joe's, you gotta get me some fruit! 

JERRY

Oh so what I'm going to buy all your fruit now? 

GEORGE

Well if Houdini couldn't do it, what chance do I have? 

JERRY

Hello... Oh hi Patty, thanks for calling me back. I-I just wanted to ask you a question: when we we're going out did you have orgasms?... Okay, thanks... No that's it... Ya, Okay, bye. 

JERRY

Patty Lawrence had 'em! 

KRAMER

Alright look I'm gonna make you a fruit list, all right? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

JERRY

Hello Elaine? Patty Lawrence had orgasms what do you think about that? And I got calls in to six other women and I bet you they confirm an orgasm too. So what do you have to say now Elaine?... Hello? 

JERRY

Why do I feel like I'm doing something wrong? 

KRAMER

All right now here's the list. (hands Jerry the list) 

JERRY

All this? It's too much. What do you need five mangos for? 

KRAMER

I like mangos. 

JERRY

Avocado? I don't know how to pick out an avocado. 

KRAMER

Well they gotta be soft. 

JERRY

How soft? 

KRAMER

Not too soft. Better too hard than too soft. 

JERRY

(looking over the list) Hmm ah. I'm not going through this every week, I tell you that right now. And what are these? Plums? What is that? 

KRAMER

Yeah now get the ones that are red on the inside. 

JERRY

Uh huh. Well how do I know what they look like on the inside? What do they look like on the outside? 

KRAMER

Oh! And get some plantains. (grabs the list to write them down) 

JERRY

Plantains? 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

JERRY

What the hell is a plantain. 

KRAMER

It's part of the banana family. It's a delicacy. 

JERRY

(grabbing the list from Kramer) You're not getting any plantains. 

JERRY

Hey Joe. 

JOE

How's it going? 

JERRY

Good, just getting some fruit for myself. Uh, gotta have fruit in the house. I like it as a snack. Wholesome, natural, chock-full of vitamins. Alright let's see... mangos... four plums with red on the inside... avocado... (looks at Joe; Joe gives him a weird look)ooo, just right... and three plantains uh ought to do it. 

JOE

All right, all right, just hold it right there. 

JERRY

What? 

JOE

This fruit isn't for you. 

JERRY

(shocked) Wha, what are you talking about? 

JOE

You think I don't know huh? Mangos, plantains, plums with the red on the inside, that's Kramer! 

JERRY

I can't buy mangos and plantains? 

JOE

All right, get out! 

JERRY

You're making a big mistake, Joe! 

JOE

I'll tell you something else: I don't what your business anymore either. 

JERRY

Are saying you're banning me from the store? 

JOE

That's exactly what I'm saying. 

JERRY

I'm banned?! 

JOE

You're banned. 

GEORGE

All right, where do you want it? 

JERRY

Put it over there. 

KRAMER

Yes! Oh look at this, these mangos are beautiful! Oh these are beautiful, (smells them) you did good George. 

GEORGE

All right I gotta get going. 

JERRY

What are you doing? 

GEORGE

I got a date with Karen. I don't know what I'm gonna do. Nothing happening down there. 

JERRY

You're thinking about it too much. You're putting too much emphasis on it. 

GEORGE

I knew this was gonna happen some day. It was inevitable. I've known it ever since I was a little kid. I've been waiting for it. 

KRAMER

This mango is delicious! 

GEORGE

That reminds me, I'm not getting you guys any more fruit. That guy was eyeballing me the whole time. He gave me the creeps. All right, you owe me twenty-eight sixty. 

JERRY

Sorry, I don't have any cash. 

KRAMER

I only got hundreds. 

GEORGE

You see... All right I knew it. 

KRAMER

Come on, come on, we're gonna pay you! Here have some mango. 

GEORGE

I don't want any mango. 

KRAMER

Come on, take some. It's good. 

GEORGE

Very good. Juicy. 

KRAMER

Ya. 

GEORGE

Ripe. Boy, this Joe's got some terrific fruit. 

KRAMER

Mmm. 

JERRY

What? 

GEORGE

I feel like I got a B12 shot. This is like a taste explosion! 

KRAMER

Ya I told you. 

JERRY

What is it? 

GEORGE

I think it moved. Oh my god, I think it moved. Yeah, give me the big piece. I'll see you later. 

ELAINE

Hi George. 

GEORGE

I'm back, baby, I'm back! 

KRAMER

Want some mango? 

ELAINE

Noo, thanks. 

JERRY

Well well, if it isn't the first lady of the American Theatre. (Elaine smiles and rolls her eyes at him) What brings you here? 

ELAINE

Just gonna return some of your things that were in my house. 

JERRY

Oh and I've got some things of yours here. 

ELAINE

I know. 

JERRY

Well I'll get them. 

ELAINE

I'm waiting. 

JERRY

All right. (goes into his hallway and comes back) You got my fins? 

ELAINE

Yeah I got your fins. You got my poker chips? 

JERRY

I got your poker chips. You got my goggles? 

ELAINE

They're next to the fins. You got my cards? 

JERRY

They're next to the poker chips. 

ELAINE

All right and that just about... does it. 

JERRY

I guess. 

ELAINE

Okay, welp... see you around. 

JERRY

Yeah, see you. 

ELAINE

All right, let's go, I give you half an hour. 

JERRY

(shocked) What? 

ELAINE

Come on! 

JERRY

Are you serious? 

ELAINE

Look, Jerry, we have to have sex to save the friendship. 

JERRY

Sex... to save the friendship. (Elaine drops her bag, takes off her jacket and walks into Jerry's bedroom) Well, if we have to (un-tucks his shirt) we have to. 

KAREN

Mmmm, Oh George, oooh. 

GEORGE

Please, it's not necessary. 

KAREN

Mmm What's not necessary? 

GEORGE

The little extra moan you threw in there. Laying it on a bit thick, don't you think? 

KAREN

What are you talking about? 

GEORGE

What am I talking about? Come on. (laughing) You don't think I bought all that? (does a little move) 

KAREN

What, what? 

GEORGE

You're very good. Very good with the moanings and the gyrations. Y-You really had me going there for a minute. 

KAREN

You think I was faking? 

GEORGE

Come on: 'Oh George, oh Geeeooorge!' Come on! Not that I don't appreciate the effort that was put into it. 

KAREN

I'd like you to leave. 

GEORGE

What? 

KAREN

I said, I would like you to leave. Come on, just get your clothes on and get out. 

GEORGE

But why? 

KAREN

Because I said so. (pushes George off the bed) 

GEORGE

I-I-I can't find my glasses. 

KAREN

Well hurry up. 

GEORGE

I need to look for my glasses. 

KAREN

(seen through George eyes all blurry) Get out! Get out!! Get out!!! 

JERRY

It's all George's fault. All that talk about impotence. It got to me. And that orgasm stuff: orgasm this and orgasm that. It's a lot of pressure! 

ELAINE

You know I'm a little hungry. You wouldn't happen to have any of that mango left? 

GEORGE

I can't believe this. 

JERRY

Oh, it won't be for that long. 

GEORGE

How can I do this? How can I move back in with those people? Please, tell me. They're insane. You know that. 

JERRY

Hey, my parents are just as crazy as your parents. 

GEORGE

How can you compare you parents to my parents?! 

JERRY

My father has never thrown anything out. Ever! 

GEORGE

My father wears his sneakers in the pool! Sneakers! 

JERRY

My mother has never set foot in a natural body of water. 

GEORGE

(Showing Jerry up) Listen carefully. My mother has never laughed. Ever. Not a giggle, not a chuckle, not a tee-hee.. never went 'Ha!' 

JERRY

A smirk? 

GEORGE

Maybe!.. And I'm moving back in there! 

JERRY

I told you I'd lend you the money for the rent. 

GEORGE

No, no, no, no. Borrowing money from a friend is like having sex. It just completely changes the relationship. 

KRAMER

Alright. I'm ready. (To George) You know, I still don't understand - why do you want to move back in with your parents? 

GEORGE

I don't want to! I'm outta money! I got 714 dollars left in the bank. 

KRAMER

Well, move in here. 

JERRY

(Stopping the notion) What's that? 

KRAMER

Why doesn't he just move in here? 

GEORGE

(Sarcastic) Yeah, yeah. I'm gonna move in with him. He doesn't even let you use the toilet! 

KRAMER

You can move in with me, if you want. 

GEORGE

(Sincerely) Thank you.. I, uh.. that might not work out. 

ESTELLE

Careful! Careful with the suitcases! We just painted! 

KRAMER

Hello, Mrs. Costanza. 

JERRY

(quietly) Hello, Mrs. Costanza. 

ESTELLE

(not really noticing Jerry said Hello) Hello, Kramer. Close the door. 

KRAMER

Well, I gotta bring in more stuff. (Heads for the door) 

ESTELLE

More stuff?! 

KRAMER

Yeah. (Exits) 

ESTELLE

(To George) How much is there?! 

GEORGE

(Annoyed) There's more. 

ESTELLE

So, how are ya, Jerry? 

JERRY

Fine, Mrs. Costanza. (Attempts to get Estelle to laugh) Hey, I got a terrific joke for you.. 

ESTELLE

(Sits down on the couch) Nah, not interested. 

JERRY

No, no. It-It's really funny. There's these two guys- 

ESTELLE

(Interrupting) Tell it to the audience. (George gives Jerry an 'I told you so' look) Here, (Picks up a plate full of sandwiches) I made some bologna sandwiches. 

GEORGE

Bologna?! No one eats bologna anymore! 

ESTELLE

What are you talking about?! (to Jerry) Have a sandwich. 

JERRY

(setting down a box) No thanks. 

ESTELLE

Oh, stop it! You don't want one, Kramer? 

KRAMER

Uhh.. no thanks. (Goes back out the door) 

ESTELLE

I think you're all a little touched in the head. (Puts the plate down) You're so worried about your health.. You're young men. 

JERRY

I really don't eat it. 

ESTELLE

What am I gonna do with all these sandwiches?! Will you take them home? Give them to someone in your building? 

JERRY

I don't know if I'd feel comfortable handing out bologna sandwiches in the building.. 

KRAMER

(Enters with a box) Alright, that's it. Anything else? 

GEORGE

(Muttering) No, that's it. 

KRAMER

Oh, I gotta go move the car. Alright (Leaves) 

JERRY

Well, I guess we'll be going.. (Heads for the door) 

GEORGE

(Runs over to him, not wanting him to leave) What? You're going? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

GEORGE

Wha - what are you doing later? 

JERRY

Oh, Elaine and I are going out to dinner with Kramer and his new girlfriend. 

GEORGE

Really? 

JERRY

Yeah, You can't believe this woman. She's one of those low-talkers. You can't hear a word she's saying! You're always going 'excuse me?', 'what was that?' 

GEORGE

Yeah.. may - maybe I'll meet ya? 

ESTELLE

No, George. We're going out to eat tonight with your father. 

GEORGE

(Mutters) Oh.. okay.. talk to you later. 

JERRY

Yeah, take it easy. (Leaves) 

GEORGE

Oh, my God.. (Buries his face into his hands) 

ELAINE

Okay, well, he had this idea of a pizza place where you make your own pie! (Laughs) 

JERRY

Right. 

ELIANE

You remember that? 

KRAMER

Yeah, well, that was a good one. 

JERRY

Well.. 

ELAINE

What's that? 

JERRY

Excuse me? 

JERRY

Yeah.. yeah. 

ELAINE

Yep. Yeah.. 

KRAMER

You know that, uh, Leslie (Points to her) is in the clothing business? She's a designer. 

ELAINE

(Interested) Oh? 

KRAMER

In fact, she's come up with a new one that is going to be the big new look in men's fashion.. It's a, a puffy shirt. (Leslie mumbles to Kramer) Well, yeah, it - it's all puffy. Like the pirates used to wear. 

ELAINE

Oh, a puffy shirt. 

JERRY

Puffy. 

KRAMER

Yeah, see, I think people want to look like pirates. You know, it's the right time for it.. to be all puffy, and devil-may-care.. 

KRAMER

(Still laughing) That's true.. (Gets up) I'll be right back. (Walks off laughing. Jerry and Elaine are left with the low-talker. A moment passes) 

ELAINE

Uh, o... (Remembers something they could talk about) Jerry's going to be on the 'Today' show on Friday. 

JERRY

Yeah, that's right! 

ELAINE

Yep.. yep. Um, he's promoting a (pauses) benefit for Goodwill, you know, they, uh, they clothe the (clears her throat) poor, and the homeless.. 

JERRY

(Points at Elaine) And the indigent. 

ELAINE

And the indigent, yeah.. I, I do volunteer work for them. I-I set the whole thing up, and I got Jerry to do it. 

JERRY

Sure. 

ELAINE

Ohh, yeah. Yeah.. yep. 

JERRY

Uh-huh. 

ELAINE

Yep. 

JERRY

Yep.. 

ELAINE

Mmm 

ESTELLE

Maybe you should take a civil service test. 

GEORGE

(Studying the salt shaker) I'm not taking a civil service test. 

FRANK

Look at this, George. (Takes a coin out of his pocket) You ever seen a silver dollar? 

GEORGE

Yes, I've seen a silver dollar. 

ELAINE

Why don't you want to take a civil service test? 

GEORGE

To do what?! Work in a post office? Is that what you want me to do? 

FRANK

Would you believe when I was 18, I had a ssssilver dollar collection? 

ESTELLE

I don't understand. You get job security - you get a pay check every week.. 

GEORGE

I'm a college graduate. You want me to be a mailman? 

FRANK

(Still looking at his coin) You know, I couldn't bring myself to spend one of these. I got some kind of a-a-a-a-a phobia. 

ESTELLE

So what are you gonna do?! 

GEORGE

I don't know. I do know that I have some kind of a talent - something to offer. I just don't know what it is yet! 

FRANK

I bet that collection would be worth a lot of money today. (does a form of magic trick making the coin disappear as he shows George an empty hand) 

GEORGE

(Looks fed up with his parents) Oh my God.. 

FRANK

I don't like this waiter. (Holds up his hand to get the waiters attention - starts snapping) Look at him.. He sees us.. he doesn't want to come over. 

GEORGE

(Needing to get away from his parents, he gets up) I need some air.. 

ESTELLE

George, where are you going?! 

GEORGE

(Walks off) I got a lot of thinking to do. 

GEORGE

Oh, I'm sorry. I'm terribly sorry.. (Bends down, and starts picking up her things) 

WOMAN

Look at what you've done! You spilled my bag! 

GEORGE

(Stuttering) I, I, I, .. here, let me - let me help you.. 

WOMAN

No, no ,no. It's all right. (Begins helping him pick her things up) 

GEORGE

It - it's just that I'm here with my parents, and my mother wants me to take a civil service test - and to tell you the truth, I don't even think I'd pass it.. So.. 

WOMAN

Hmm.. 

GEORGE

What? 

WOMAN

(Looking at both his hands intensely) Your hands. 

GEORGE

What about them? 

WOMAN

They're quite exquisite! 

GEORGE

They are? 

WOMAN

(Mesmerized) Extraordinary! Have you ever done any hand modeling? 

GEORGE

Hand modeling? (Shakes his head 'No') 

WOMAN

(Fishes a card out of her purse, then hands it to George) Here's my card. Why don't you, uh, give me a call? (Walks off) 

JERRY

(Shrugs) I - I don't get it. 

GEORGE

Me neither! 

JERRY

What is it? 

GEORGE

I don't know. 

JERRY

They're hands! 

GEORGE

This woman just set me up for a job! 

JERRY

(Gets up, and displays his own hands) Well, what about my hands? I don't see how your hands are any better than my hands. 

GEORGE

What, are you kidding? (Points at the flaws of Jerry's hands) The knuckles are all out of proportion. you got hair over there - where do you get off comparing your hands to my hands?! This is a one-in-a-million hand. (Points to his own hand) 

JERRY

Well, that's what comes from avoiding manual labor your whole life. 

GEORGE

This is it! It happened to me, Jerry! I was sitting in the restaurant, the two nut jobs were talking - I couldn't take it any more. I got up, and (Makes a noise) I bop into this woman.. 

JERRY

It's just like in the movies. 

KRAMER

Hey. (He's carrying a suit cover. He hangs it on Jerry's coat hooks) 

JERRY

Hey. 

KRAMER

Hey, George! (Holds out his hand. George shakes it - a hand buzzer goes off. George starts freaking out. Kramer laughs) 

GEORGE

OH!!!! What are you, crazy?! Are you, crazy?! 

KRAMER

What?! 

GEORGE

You coulda damaged my hand! 

KRAMER

(Laughing) But, it's only a toy! 

JERRY

(Explaining) George has become a hand model. 

KRAMER

A hand model? 

JERRY

Yes. 

KRAMER

(To George) Really? Let me see your hands. 

GEORGE

(Defensively) You can look at them, but do NOT touch them. (Holds them out) 

KRAMER

Let's see.. (studies them) oh, those are nice. You know, I've never noticed this before? They're smooth.. creamy.. delicate, yet (Turns to Jerry) masculine. 

GEORGE

(Takes two oven mitts from his back pack) Alright, (puts them on) I gotta get going. 

JERRY

Oven mitts? 

GEORGE

(Embarrassed) That's all I could find. (A moment passes) Would you mind getting the door? 

KRAMER

Yeah.. 

JERRY

Alright. (Jerry opens the door for George) 

GEORGE

Thank you very much. (Walks out) 

KRAMER

You're not going to believe what happening with Leslie. You know, ever since you agreed to wear the puffy shirt on the Today show, she's been getting all these orders from boutiques and department stores.. 

JERRY

Uh-huh.. (Finally realizes what Kramer said, he looks up) Since I said what? 

KRAMER

Agreed to wear the puffy shirt. (Starts unzipping the suit cover) 

JERRY

What are you talking about? 

KRAMER

When you said that you'd agree to wear the puffy shirt on the Today show. (Takes the ridiculous puffy shirt out of the cover) 

JERRY

(Goes up to it) This? 

KRAMER

Yea. 

JERRY

I agreed to wear this?! 

KRAMER

Yeah, yeah. 

JERRY

But, when did I do that? 

KRAMER

When we went to dinner the other night. 

JERRY

What are you, crazy?! 

KRAMER

What were you talking about when I went to the bathroom? 

JERRY

I don't know! I couldn't understand a word she was saying! I was just nodding! 

KRAMER

(makes his pop sound) There you go. 

JERRY

Where I go? You mean she was asking me to wear this ridiculous shirt on national TV, and I said 'Yes'?! 

KRAMER

Yes, yes! You said it! 

JERRY

But, I - I didn't know what she was talking about. I couldn't hear her! 

KRAMER

(Takes it off the hook, and starts walking toward Jerry with it. He backs defensively backs away from it) Well, she asked you. 

JERRY

I - I can't wear this puffy shirt on TV! I mean, look at it! It looks ridiculous! 

KRAMER

Well, you gotta wear it now! All those stores are stocking it based on the condition that you're gonna wear this on the TV show! The factory in New Jersey is already makin' em. 

JERRY

They're making these? 

KRAMER

Yes, yes. This pirate trend that she's come up with, Jerry, this-this is gonna be the new look for the 90's. You're gonna be the first pirate! 

JERRY

(Like a little kid) But, I don't want to be a pirate! 

ESTELLE

I knew it. I knew it.. I always knew you always had beautiful hands. I used to tell people. Frank, didn't I use to talk about his hands? 

FRANK

(Looking up from his paper) Who the hell did'ya ever mention his hands to? 

ESTELLE

(Getting annoyed) I mentioned his hands to plenty of people! 

FRANK

You never mentioned them to me! 

GEORGE

(Snaps, then points to the coffee table) Hand me an Emory board. 

ESTELLE

I always talk about your hands - how they're so soft and milky white.. 

FRANK

No! You never said milky white! 

ESTELLE

(Getting angry) I said milky white! 

GEORGE

(To Estelle) Scissor. (She gets the scissors from the coffee table and hands them to George with the point facing him) Don't hand them to me with the point facing out! 

ESTELLE

I'm sorry. 

GEORGE

You're sorry?! 

ESTELLE

(Apologizing) I'll try to be more careful. 

GEORGE

(Stern, angered) I hope so. (Takes the scissors) 

ESTELLE

Georgie.. (Nudges George's arm, disrupting his work with the scissors) Oh, Georgie, would you like some Jell-O? 

FRANK

(To Estelle, referring to the Jell-O) Why'd you put the bananas in there?! 

ESTELLE

(Yelling) George likes the bananas! 

FRANK

(Trying to match her tone) So let him have bananas on the side! 

GEORGE

Alright! Please, please! I cannot have this constant bickering!.. Stress is very damaging to the epidermis! Now, I have an important photo session in the morning - my hands have got to be in tip-top shape, so please - keep the television down, and the conversation to a minimum. 

ESTELLE

(Meek) But Georgie.. what about the Jell-O? 

GEORGE

(Definite) I'll take it in my room. (Walks off) 

KRAMER

Yeah, come in. 

STAGEHAND

I just wanted to let you know he's got about five minutes. 

KRAMER

Giddy-Up. (Stagehand leaves) Jerry! Five minutes! 

KRAMER

Now that's a great looking shirt! (Gets up, admiring the shirt) Aye Captain! (Growls like a pirate) Yeah! I'm glad I ironed it. It's perfect. (Walks around Jerry, inspecting the shirt) Look at it! It's fantastic! 

JERRY

(Resisting) Kramer, how am I gonna wear this?! I-I can't wear this! 

KRAMER

(Reassuring) Hey, this look's better than anything you own. You know, in two months time, everybody's gonna be wearing the (imitates a pirate) pirate look! 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

ELAINE

Hi, Kramer. Guess what - I just saw Bryant Gumbel, he said he might help out at the benefit! 

KRAMER

Great. 

ELAINE

(Between laughs) What is that?! 

KRAMER

It's the puffy shirt. Look at it, eh? Whatd'ya think? Is it cool or what? 

ELAINE

(To Jerry) Why're you wearing that now? 

JERRY

(Obviously mad at the situation he's in) 'Why am I wearing is now?? I'll tell you why I'm wearing it now - because the lowtalker asked me to, that's why! And I said 'yes'. Do you know why? Because I couldn't HEAR her! 

ELAINE

When did she, (Snickers) when did she ask you this? 

JERRY

When we were at dinner, when Kramer went to the bathroom. 

ELAINE

I didn't hear anything. 

JERRY

(Yelling out) Of course not! Nobody hears anything when this woman speaks! 

ELAINE

(Just now making the matter serious) Well, you can't wear that on the show. 

KRAMER

(To Elaine, muffled, low, and threatening) Elaine, you want to stop? 

ELAINE

(Turning around to Kramer) Wha- What? No. (Back to Jerry) Jerry, you are promoting a benefit to CLOTHE homeless people. You can't come out dressed like that! You're all puffed up!.. You look like the Count of Monte Cristo! 

JERRY

(Arms out, complaining) I have to wear it! The woman has orders for this shirt based on me wearing it on TV.. they're producing them as we speak! 

ELAINE

(Arguing) Yeah, but you're supposed to be a compassionate person! That cares about poor people! You look like you're gonna.. swing in on a chandelier! 

STAGEHAND

(Looking down at a clipboard, enters) Okay, let's go. (Looks up, points at Jerry's puffy shirt) Is that what you're wearing? 

MAN

I've never seen hands like these before.. 

WOMAN

They're so soft and milky white. 

PHOTOGRAPHER

You know who's hands they remind me of? (Pauses for effect) Ray McKigney. 

MAN

Ugh.. Ray. 

PHOTOGRAPHER

He was it. 

GEORGE

Who was he? 

PHOTOGRAPHER

The most exquisite hands you've ever seen.. Oh, he had it all. 

GEORGE

(Hands still out, even though they've stopped looking at them) What happened to him? 

MAN

(Clears throat) Tragic story, I'm afraid. He could've had any woman in the world.. but none could match the beauty of his own hand.. and that became his one true love.. 

GEORGE

You mean, uh..? 

MAN

Yes. he was not.. master of his domain. 

GEORGE

(Makes a gesture saying he understands. The man nods) But how.. uh..? 

MAN

(Quick, to the point) The muscles.. became so strained with.. overuse, that eventually the hand locked into a deformed position, and he was left with nothing but a claw. (Holds hand up, displaying a claw-like shape) He traveled the world seeking a cure.. acupuncturists.. herbalists.. swamis.. nothing helped. Towards the end, his hands became so frozen the was unable to manipulate utensils, (Visibly disgusted by this last part) and was dependent on Cub Scouts to feed him. I hadn't seen another pair of hands like Ray McKigney's until today. You are his successor. (George looks down at his hands) I uh only hope you have a little more self-control. 

GEORGE

(Smiling to himself) You don't have to worry about me. (Nodding, gloating) I won a contest. 

PHOTOGRAPHER

Ok, let's get to work. 

BRYANT

(Talking directly to the camera) Back now, 7:46. On Tuesday the 19th here in New York there will be a benefit for the Goodwill Industries - a used clothing organization that provides services to the needy. One of the performers will be comedian Jerry Seinfeld. (Turns to face Jerry) Jerry, good morning. 

JERRY

(Mumbling out) Thank you, Bryant. 

BRYANT

(Pointing out) And speaking of clothing, that is a very, very unusual shirt you have on. 

JERRY

(Looking down at the shirt; mumbling) Oh, thank you. 

BRYANT

You're all kinda, (Waves his hands around) kinda 'puffed up'. (Chuckles) 

JERRY

Yeah, it's a puffy shirt. 

BRYANT

(Laughing) You look kinda like a pirate. 

JERRY

(Nervous laughter) Yeah.. like a pirate.. (Attempting to get on another subject) Anyway, ah, you know, we're hoping to, um, raise enough money.. with this.. uh.. 

BRYANT

(Rudely interrupting, still snickering at the shirt) You.. ah, look, I'm sorry, it is just a VERY unusual shirt. It could be kind of a whole new look for you.. you know, you could put a patch over an eye, you could be kind of like the pirate-comedian. 

JERRY

Uh-huh, yeah. (Smiling, nodding, clearly wanting Bryant to shut up) 

BRYANT

Are you going to be wearing the shirt at the concert? 

JERRY

(Losing it, mad) Look, it's not my shirt. 

BRYANT

(Confused) Whose shirt is it? 

JERRY

What's the difference? I agreed to wear it. It's - it's a puffy shirt. I feel ridiculous in it, and I think it's the stupidest shirt I've ever seen, to be perfectly honest with you. (Nodding) 

LESLIE

(Off camera, shrill, high pitched yelling) You bastard! 

BRYANT

(To Jerry) Did you hear that? 

JERRY

(Pointing off screen, nodding) THAT I heard. 

PHOTOGRAPHER

(Instructing George) Alright, a little to the left.. Little higher, little higher. Good. Perfect! Perfect. 

GEORGE

Like that? 

PHOTOGRAPHER

Just like that. Hold it. (Takes picture) Good, ok, let me get just one more, one more. (Takes another picture) Good, that's it. You're done. 

GEORGE

That's it? 

PHOTOGRAPHER

(Smiling) That's it. 

MAN

(Pulling a slip of paper out of his coat pocket) And here's your check. (George accepts) Thank you very much. (Pats him on the back) It was an honor. 

WOMAN

It was great working with you. (Somewhat coy) Your hands are beautiful. 

GEORGE

(Modest) Oh, thank you very much. (Chuckles) 

WOMAN

You know, I was wondering - if you're not doing anything later, maybe you'd like to get together..? 

LESLIE

You ruined me! You ruined my career! 

JERRY

Oh, just keep your voice down. Everyone can hear you. 

LESLIE

(Shouting out) Oh, I don't give a damn! 

JERRY

(Reasoning) You know, if you talked this loud to begin with, I wouldn't be in this costume in the first place! 

GEORGE

(Quick, excited talking) Hey, hey! You can't believe this. Look at this check! (Hands it to Jerry) They told me I had the most beautiful hands they'd ever seen in their lives - except for this McKigney guy - this great looking girl gave me her phone number.. I got it! I got it all! I'm busting. Jerry, I'm busting! 

ELAINE

Hey, I've never noticed your hands before. Let me see. 

GEORGE

Alright. (Holds them up) 

ELAINE

(Obviously not impressed, dull) Yeah, real nice. 

GEORGE

(Turning back to Jerry, he takes the check back. He just now notices the shirt Jerry's wearing, and snickers, pointing) Nice shirt.. (Laughs, Jerry shrugs) What is this? Is this what you wore on the show? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

GEORGE

What, have you completely lost your mind? 

KRAMER

(Faint, trying to shut George up) Hey.. 

GEORGE

Who's dressing you? (Laughs) You look like a complete idiot! You know, I wouldn't wipe my- (Unable to take anymore, Leslie gets up and shoves George violently. His hands go straight for the hot iron sitting on the dressing room table. George screams out in agony) AAHHHH!!!!! (his voice is heard outside the building, on the street, and in the park were a bunch of pigeons are scared by the yelling) 

ELAINE

You ready? 

GEORGE

Ow! Hot! Hot! 

ELAINE

(Sincere) I'm sorry. 

GEORGE

(Reflecting on his life gone wrong) This McKigney guy had a few good years.. (To Kramer, bitter) How could you forget to turn off an iron? 

KRAMER

Well, I was excited because Jerry was putting on the puffy shirt. 

GEORGE

My whole life is ruined because of the (Mocking, bitter tone) 'puffy shirt'. 

JERRY

(Pointing out) It didn't do me any good either! That benefit was the worst show I ever did. Some of those heckles were really uncalled for: 'Avast ye matey' - what the hell does that mean?! '20 degrees off the starboard side - the Spanish Galleon!' - there's no comeback for that! 

ELAINE

(Reflecting) Well, it got me fired from the benefit committee. 

KRAMER

You know all those stores canceled out on her? She's finished. (Concluding) We're (Leslie and him) finished. 

JERRY

Really? What happened? 

KRAMER

(Showing pure irony) I just can't be with someone who's life is in complete disarray. 

JERRY

What happened with all the shirts? 

KRAMER

They gave them all to Goodwill. 

MAN

Ahh, can you spare a little change for an old buccaneer? 

JERRY

(While digging in his pocket for some money, he looks over the shirts one last time) You know, it's really not a bad looking shirt.. 

ELAINE

Do you ever spit on anybody from here? 

JERRY

No. You? 

ELAINE

No. Do you ever think about it? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

ELAINE

Me too. 

KRAMER

Hey. 

JERRY

Hey. 

KRAMER

Well I got it! 

JERRY

You got me the air conditioner? 

KRAMER

What do you think? 

JERRY

Beautiful! 

ELAINE

What air conditioner? 

KRAMER

Well my buddy works in an appliance store and he got us thirty percent off. 

JERRY

Is it a good one? 

KRAMER

Good one? It's the Commando 8. 

JERRY

Commando 8? 

KRAMER

12,000 BTU's. 

ELAINE

I thought you hated air conditioning. You've never had an air conditioner. 

KRAMER

Yeah, but Amy likes air conditioning. 

ELAINE

Oooh, you're getting an air conditioner for Amy. (In a wining voice:) Amy doesn't like the temperature up here. She's a little hoooot. 

JERRY

All right. 

KRAMER

Okay, so, I'm gonna measure the window up, okay buddy? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

KRAMER

Yeah. (George enters the apartment wearing goggles) Yeah, rock on! 

GEORGE

I gotta get out of this city. 

JERRY

So you're tunneling to the center of the Earth? (Elaine laughs silently) 

GEORGE

I'm at the health club and while I'm in the pool, some guy walks off with my glasses. Who steals prescription glasses? 

ELAINE

You don't have an old pair? 

GEORGE

I broke 'em playing basketball. 

JERRY

He was running from a bee. (Elaine laughs) 

GEORGE

Now if I wanna see anything I gotta wear these. 

ELAINE

George, those are prescription goggles? What is there to see in a health club pool? 

JERRY

There's a lot of change down there. 

GEORGE

When I find that guy, this much I vow: those glasses will be returned to their rightful owner. 

JERRY

We're behind you, Aquaboy. Godspeed! 

GEORGE

What kind of a sick, demented person wants another person's glasses? 

ELAINE

Yeah, especially those frames. 

KRAMER

You know what you ought to do? Go see my friend Dwayne at J & T Optical on Columbus Avenue. He'll give you thirty percent off. 

GEORGE

Yeah, come on. 

JERRY

Hey, he just got me thirty percent off on an air conditioner. 

GEORGE

Really? 

KRAMER

Retail is for suckers. 

GEORGE

Wow. Uh, what do I have to do? 

KRAMER

You just gotta mention my name. 

GEORGE

That's it? 

KRAMER

That's it. (smacks George on the forehead with a ruler) 

GEORGE

What about these? 

ELAINE

They look good. I liked the other one too. I've liked about five of them. 

GEORGE

Well, it's a tough decision. I have to wear these every day. I'm deciding on a new face. 

JERRY

(bored) Come on, George. Pick a face and go with it. 

ELAINE

Now those look good, they're very bold. 

GEORGE

Yes, they are bold. Jerry, what do you think? 

JERRY

(While looking at posters of women wearing glasses) I think these women would be pretty good looking if they weren't wearing glasses. 

ELAINE

Hi there, little doggy. (to owner:) Do you mind if I pet your dog? 

OWNER

It's okay with me. 

ELAINE

Hey little doggy. (Elaine pets the dog and he bites her) Aaah! 

DWAYNE

Hey, you can't have that dog in here. 

JERRY

Are you okay? Did he bite ya? 

GEORGE

Can you believe that guy? 

ELAINE

I'm okay, it's just a nip. 

GEORGE

He just walked away! And once again I'm standing here like a little man. Well not this time! (George leaves the store and follows the dog owner) You! Dog man! 

ELAINE

My leg looks pretty bad. 

JERRY

Oh I'm gonna take you over to the emergency room. 

ELAINE

Okay. 

JERRY

(To George:) Hey, any luck? Did you catch 'em? 

GEORGE

Uuh, no, no. 

JERRY

All right, I'm gonna take Elaine over to the hospital. 

GEORGE

(In a really strange way) Good, good, do that. 

JERRY

What's the matter? 

GEORGE

Oh, no, nothing. 

JERRY

What is it? 

GEORGE

I can't tell you. 

ELAINE

(pulling on Jerry's pants from the ground) Jerry, can we go? 

JERRY

Yeah, yeah, in a second, in a second. (And to George:) What do you mean you can't tell me? 

GEORGE

I can't tell you, don't ask. 

JERRY

I'm asking! 

ELAINE

Jerry, my leg. 

JERRY

Yeah, yeah, take care of it. (Jerry throws her some toilet paper) Come on, George, what is it? 

GEORGE

I saw Amy making out with your cousin Jeffrey. 

JERRY

What? 

GEORGE

They were right outside! 

JERRY

Amy and Jeffrey? 

GEORGE

Yes! 

JERRY

Are you sure? 

GEORGE

Yes, positive. 

JERRY

But you can't see, there's no lenses in those frames. 

GEORGE

I know! I was squinting. 

ELAINE

Okay, listen, Jerry, you just catch up with me okay? You can just follow the trail of blood. 

JERRY

We're gonna have to talk about this later. (Elaine holds the door open for Jerry while holding her leg) Thank you. Taxi! 

GEORGE

(To the store owner:) Excuse me, what do you think of these? 

DWAYNE

Oh, we just got those in. It's a very exciting new frame. 

GEORGE

Yes, it is exciting! All right, this is gonna be my new face. 

DWAYNE

All right, do you have a prescription? 

GEORGE

Yeah. (George hands over the prescription) Kramer... 

DWAYNE

What? 

GEORGE

Kramer... 

DWAYNE

What about him? 

GEORGE

You do know Kramer? 

DWAYNE

Yes... 

GEORGE

Well, I'm mentioning his name. 

DWAYNE

Why? 

GEORGE

Because... you know... 

DWAYNE

No, I don't know. Look, I'm gonna need a deposit on these. 

ELAINE

Oh, come on. Cousin Jeffrey? It's not possible! 

JERRY

Why not? They could have met. She loves the park, he works for the Parks Department. 

ELAINE

Jerry, that is so ridiculous. But, George didn't even have his glasses on! 

JERRY

But he was squinting. 

ELAINE

So what? Squinting doesn't make that much of a difference. 

JERRY

Are you kidding? I've seen 'em squint. He can squint his way down to like twenty, thirty vision. Once we were driving down from the Catskills and he lost his glasses. He squinted his way from Wortsborough down to the Tappan Zee Bridge! He was spotting raccoons, on the road! 

DOCTER

Okay. 

ELAINE

Okay? That's it? I don't need a shot? 

DOCTER

Not shot, dog bite. 

ELAINE

No, no, no. I know I wasn't shot. Do I need a shot? 

DOCTER

Not shot, dog bite. Woof woof, not bang bang. 

JERRY

Nah, look at this. Cable's out. 

AMY

Oh that's okay, we don't have to watch tv. 

JERRY

No, no, no. No trouble at all, it's a principal the thing. (Jerry picks up the phone and dials the number) I like them to know that I know what's going on. That they're not... getting away with anything. Oh, I'm on hold. So, what did you do yesterday? 

AMY

Yesterday? 

JERRY

Yeah, you remember yesterday? Beautiful day... good day to be... out. 

AMY

I didn't do anything. 

JERRY

(laughing) Oh you must have done something. 

AMY

No, nothing really. 

JERRY

Didn't go out of the house? Didn't take a walk... on Columbus Avenue? 

AMY

Well, I did go out for a little while. 

JERRY

Well, your day's getting more interesting already. (Jerry shows the phone) Ah, see, told me they'd be back in a minute and THEY lied. 

AMY

You can't thrust anyone. 

JERRY

No you can't. (hangs up the phone) Now let's cut the ball, sister! You think I don't know about you swapping spit with somebody yesterday on Columbus Avenue? 

AMY

What are you talking about? 

JERRY

Look, my friend saw you. 

AMY

Saw me? With who? 

JERRY

You tell me. 

AMY

There's nothing to tell. 

JERRY

There isn't? 

AMY

No. 

JERRY

Oh... all right... wanna get some pizza? 

AMY

I had a feeling this was to good to be true. 

JERRY

Why? 

AMY

I knew there had to be another side to you. 

JERRY

No, no, there's no side! 

AMY

There is a side, an ugly side. 

JERRY

No, no, no ugly side. 

AMY

Look, I think I'm gonna go. 

JERRY

Why? 

AMY

It's really hot in here. 

JERRY

Uuh, so we can still go out on Friday though? 

AMY

Yeah. When you getting an air conditioner? 

JERRY

It's coming! It's a Commando 8! 12.000 BTU's! It's gonna be like a meat locker in here. 

JERRY

I was an idiot for listening to you! 

GEORGE

Hey, I saw what I saw. 

JERRY

Ooh, everything was going so well. She hadn't seen any flaws in me. Now she sees a side. 

GEORGE

What side? 

JERRY

A bad side, an ugly side. 

GEORGE

Ooh, so what? 

JERRY

So what? I wasn't planning on showing that side for another six months. Now you make me throw off the whole learning curve. 

GEORGE

Why don't you just ask Jeffrey? 

JERRY

Ah, he'd just deny it. 

GEORGE

There must be some way to find out. 

JERRY

Amy said nothing happened. 

GEORGE

What, you're gonna take her word over mine? I'm your best friend! 

JERRY

Yeah, but you're blind as a bat! 

GEORGE

I was squinting! Remember that drive from Wortsborough? (snapping his fingers) I was spotting those raccoons. 

JERRY

They were mailboxes, you idiot. I didn't have the heart to tell you. 

GEORGE

(noticing something) Hey look, a dime. 

GEORGE

Heh, Mercury head. You mind? 

JERRY

(Stunned:) No, keep it. (Elaine enters the apartment) Hey what happened to you? You buzzed five minutes ago. 

ELAINE

There was a dog in front of the building and it spooked me. I couldn't come in until he left. 

JERRY

A little white dog? 

ELAINE

Yeah. 

JERRY

Snowball? You were afraid of Snowball? 

ELAINE

I'm afraid of dogs now. 

JERRY

He's like a squirrel. 

ELAINE

Well he frightened me. 

GEORGE

Did you get the shot? 

ELAINE

No. He said I didn't need a shot. 

GEORGE

You got bit by a strange dog and you didn't get a rabies shot? 

ELAINE

What, you think I should have? 

JERRY

You know, you should just go back to the optical store and ask Dwayne if he knows the name of the owner of the dog. 

ELAINE

All right, that's a good idea. I'm gonna do that. 

KRAMER

The AC is on it's way. 

GEORGE

Pardon me, I went to see your friend Dwayne... there was no discount. 

KRAMER

What? 

GEORGE

That's right, no discount! 

KRAMER

Well did you mention my name? 

GEORGE

Yes, I mentioned your name. 

KRAMER

And? 

GEORGE

Pbbbs, Bubkis! 

KRAMER

Now I don't believe this. That guy owes me big time. I got him off sugar! Look, I'm gonna go down there with you right now. 

GEORGE

All right, let me just... I'm gonna grap an apple. 

JERRY

Hey, Kramer, Elaine's afraid of Snowball! 

KRAMER

Little Snowball? He runs on batteries! 

ELAINE

You know, George, that's an onion. 

GEORGE

Yes it is. 

ELAINE

He couldn't tell an apple from an union and he's your eye witness? 

GEORGE

I saw them making out, you can believe it. 

JERRY

I don't know what to believe! You're eating unions, you're spotting dimes, I don't know what the hell is going on. 

KRAMER

Look, all you gotta to do, is get Amy and Jeffrey together somewhere, that's it. 

JERRY

Hey wait a second, wait a second. I'm going over to Jeffrey's apartment tomorrow night to pick up these Paul Simon tickets. I'm gonna surprise Amy. All I gotta do is bring her with me. And then when Jeffrey opens the door, it's Howdy Doody time. 

KRAMER

Right this way, mister Doody! 

GEORGE

(crying from the onion) You'll see I'm right. 

KRAMER

Hey, Dwayny. 

DWAYNE

Oh hello Kramer. 

KRAMER

What is going on here? 

DWAYNE

What are you talking about? 

KRAMER

I'm talking about the thirty percent discount. 

ELAINE

Uhm excuse me... uh... a man came in here... 

GEORGE

Elaine, don't interrupt, they're discounting something. 

DWAYNE

Who said anything about a discount. 

KRAMER

Ooh, how quickly we forget. You owe me buddy. 

DWAYNE

For what? 

KRAMER

Remember this? 

DWAYNE

What are you doing? 

KRAMER

Six months ago you were eating four of those for breakfast and chasing it with a ring ding. And two butter fingers on the train. Sounds familiar? 

DWAYNE

Put that away! 

KRAMER

Remember that night I found you at Dinky Donuts? You were all *hopped* up on cinnamon swirls! They wouldn't serve you anymore! You wouldn't even have any teeth if it wasn't for me taking you over to Joe's fruit stand and stuffin' cantaloupe down your throat! So much for gratitude... yeah, yeah, yeah! 

DWAYNE

All right, all right, all right! I'll give him the discount, just put that thing away! This squares us. 

ELAINE

Can I just have the name... 

DWAYNE

Out! 

KRAMER

We'll see you Dwayne. 

JERRY

I don't know what to tell you, Elton. 

ELAINE

(While reading a book:) Oh oh, listen to this, this is not good, listen to these symptoms for rabies: anxiety, irritability. I got those, I'm irritable! 

JERRY

(To George:) Who picked these out? 

GEORGE

I did! 

JERRY

They're ladies' glasses! You know all you need is that little chain around your neck so you can wear 'em while you're playing Canasta. 

GEORGE

Well Elaine was supposed to help me. 

ELAINE

Hey! I got bit by a dog! I had to go to the hospital! I was bleeding to death! I can't solve every little problem you have! 

JERRY

Hey, hey. 

ELAINE

I'm sorry... sorry. 

KRAMER

Commando 8 has arrived! 

JERRY

Take it to the window. 

KRAMER

12.000 BTU's of raw cooling power. (Kramer places the air conditioner in the window) Installed! 

GEORGE

That's it? You don't have to screw it in or anything? 

KRAMER

No, just plug it in and the Commando 8 does the rest. (And to Jerry:) I'll seal that up later, right? 

JERRY

Just in time for Amy. 

GEORGE

Oh yeah, when are you gonna execute that plan? 

ELAINE

I've got such a headache. Oh, that's another symptom! 

KRAMER

Of what? 

JERRY

Rabies. 

KRAMER

Oh that's fatal, you don't want that! 

ELAINE

I know I don't want it! I don't need you to tell me what I don't want, you stupid hipster dufus! 

JERRY

Hey, hey, what is this? What's going on here? 

ELAINE

I'm sorry, Kramer, I'm sorry. 

KRAMER

No, no, it's all right. I had a friend who had rabies once. (George's eating chips) May I have one of those, madam? 

GEORGE

Madam? What are you calling me madam for? 

KRAMER

They're ladies' glasses. 

KRAMER

Now look here, see it's right here: Gloria Vanderbilt Collection. 

GEORGE

He sold me ladies' glasses! 

ELAINE

I... I think I'm... I'm having trouble swallowing. I can't... I can't swallow. 

KRAMER

She's got rabies, just like my friend Bob Sacamano. She's delirious. (Elaine drinks some water and drools) She's foaming at the mouth! 

ELAINE

Is this gonna hurt? 

DOCTER

Yes, very much. 

ELAINE

What if Jeffrey's not home. Did you ever think of that? 

JERRY

Oh he'll be home, it's Friday night. That's the big night on the Nature Channel. 

ELAINE

Let me tell you this: there is no way cousin Jeffrey is dating Amy. He looks like a horse! 

JERRY

He does look like a horse. 

ELAINE

Yeah, he's got a real horse face. (Elaine, while looking out the window:) Here, look at this! It's the guy with the dog! (She opens the window and screams:) Hey! Hey! You down there! Remember me? I had to get shot because of your stupid dog! 

OWNER

Hey who are you calling stupid? 

JERRY

Hey, shall we spit on him? 

ELAINE

No no no no, come on, let's go downstairs. 

KRAMER

(Singing:) Oh myyyy papayaaaa. (The air conditioner wobbles) The air conditioner! (Kramer tries to keep it from falling by holding it's cord, but it snaps) I think it got the dog! 

GEORGE

Ah, Oh boy. 

MAN

Excuse me, uh I'm new here, would you mind walking me back to my locker? 

GEORGE

Oh uuh, sure, why not. (the blind man hangs on to George's arm) Hey, that's the guy. 

MAN

What guy? 

GEORGE

The guy that stole my glasses. This time I got 'em! (George follows the man onto the street, dragging the blind man with him) Would you pick it up a little? 

MAN

Where the hell are we going? 

GEORGE

He's getting on a bus, damn! (To the blind man:) Those are nice glasses. 

MAN

I don't like 'em, they pinch my nose. 

GEORGE

Is that right? 

GEORGE

Dwayne, my friend and I would like to exchange frames. Could you put his lenses in my frames and mine in his? 

DWAYNE

(While eating a candy bar:) Yeah, we can do that. 

GEORGE

And I'd like a discount. 

DWAYNE

Why should I give you a discount. 

GEORGE

Listen, you're lucking I'm not asking for a whole refund. (trying to speak quietly) You gave me ladies' frames! 

MAN

What's that about ladies' frames? 

OWNER

I'm trying to track down that lady that was in here the other day, the one that was messing with my dog. 

GEORGE

Yeah, well, she's trying to track you down. 

OWNER

Well I would love to talk with her. (George chuckles) She lives on 81st Street, right? 

GEORGE

No, that's Jerry. 

OWNER

Really? You wouldn't happen to know what apartment he's in, would you? 

GEORGE

Yeah, 5A! 

OWNER

Thanks a lot! 

AMY

So what are we doing here? 

JERRY

Oh, you'll find out. 

AMY

I don't know, you're acting very mysteriously. 

JERRY

Well, I'm very mysterious by nature. (Jerry knocks on the door) A lot of women find that attractive. 

AMY

I find it annoying. 

JERRY

Oh? 

LEO

Helloooo! 

JERRY

Uncle Leo?! 

LEO

Come on in. 

JERRY

This is Amy. 

LEO

Hello Amy. 

JERRY

Unlce Leo, what are you doing here? 

LEO

Jeffrey went out tonight. 

JERRY

Ooh! Very convenient. 

LEO

I'm supposed to tape this nature show for him, he loves nature. Botany, zoology. You know his botany teacher from college stays in close touch with him? They became friends! 

JERRY

Oh really? 

LEO

That's pretty rare! I mean, actual friends! Like equals! They have dinner together, they have discussions... 

JERRY

Uncle Leo! Did he leave any tickets here for me? 

LEO

Oh yeah yeah, I'll get 'em. 

JERRY

Thank you. 

AMY

What tickets? 

JERRY

To the Paul Simon concert in the park! 

AMY

We're going to the Paul Simon concert? 

JERRY

That's right, lady! 

AMY

Oh what a great surprise! 

JERRY

I thought you'd like that. 

AMY

Oooh, so that's why you've been acting so mysteriously. 

JERRY

Now you know. That, and that alone, is the reason. 

LEO

You know Jeffrey's favorite animal: the leopard. 

AMY

Why is that? 

LEO

He likes the spots. Oh uh, here's the tickets. 

JERRY

Thank you. 

LEO

Oh uh, he asked me to give you a message. He said that uh he's very sorry and uh he hopes you'll forgive 'em. 

JERRY

(To Amy:) Aha! So it's true! You were making out with him! 

AMY

What are you talking about, I don't know Jeffrey. Oh so this is why you brought me up here? 

JERRY

Oh very convincing, but it's not gonna work this time. 

LEO

What are you talking about? All he meant was that he was sorry that the seats aren't very good. 

JERRY

Oh... oh... wanna get some pizza? 

GEORGE

Boy, these really do pinch the nose. 

MAN

Tough luck! A deal's a deal. 

GEORGE

Oh my God it is them. 

JERRY

I still don't know how you spotted that dime. I think you planted it. Plus I had to pay that vet bill for the stupid dog. I don't know how that guy got my name. 

GEORGE

Yeah. Hmm. Boy these really do pinch. I tell you, if I ever find the son of a bitch that stole my glasses... 

JERRY

So, does he like you? 

ELAINE

What do you think? 

JERRY

You like him? 

ELAINE

Yeah, yeah like him, definitely like him. I like him a lot. 

GEORGE

So, what's wrong with him? 

ELAINE

Nothing, and I've looked. 

GEORGE

Well, I'm sure you'll find something. 

JERRY

So, how did you meet him? 

ELAINE

In the office. 

JERRY

So, he's a writer. 

ELAINE

Yeah. 

JERRY

Yeah, big surprise. 

ELAINE

So, I was sitting at the reception desk, I was looking pretty hot. I was wearing my sling back pumps. 

GEORGE

What are those? 

ELAINE

Ask your mother, (making fun of George's living situation) you live with her now, don't you? Anyway, so then this guy comes up to me and starts feeling my jacket through his thumb and his forefinger like this. 

JERRY

So, what did you do? 

ELAINE

I said: 'So, what do you think?'. And he said, 'Gabardine?'. And I said, 'Yeah.' That was it. 

GEORGE

Wow, just felt your material? 

ELAINE

Yeah...Jake Jarmel. 

GEORGE

Sounds like a cool guy. 

JERRY

Sounds like a jerk. Felt your material, come on. 

GEORGE

Jerry, where did you get that sweater? 

JERRY

Oh, what do you think? I found it at the back of my closet. 

GEORGE

I think that's what the back of closets are for. 

ELAINE

Hey, that's Barry. Look it's Barry. (taps on the window) 

JERRY

(taps on the window) Hey... 

ELAINE

Hi. 

GEORGE

Who's that? 

JERRY

That's Barry Prophet, he's our accountant. 

GEORGE

I don't know how you can let this guy handle all your money. 

ELAINE

Oh, he doesn't handle my money, he handles Jerry's money. He just does my taxes. 

JERRY

Hey Barry, how you doing? 

BARRY

Hey, how are you? 

JERRY

This is my friend George. 

BARRY

Hi George. (shakes George's hand) 

ELAINE

Hi, what are you doing on this neighborhood? 

BARRY

Nothing really. (sniffs; looks around) You, eh, you eat here? 

JERRY

Yeah, so how's my money? 

BARRY

Well it's still green. (sniffs twice) 

JERRY

What, you got a cold? 

BARRY

No, no. 

ELAINE

Wow, look at that ring. 

BARRY

(showing off the ring to Elaine) Oh, uh you like that? (Elaine not amused gives Barry a polite laugh; Barry sniffs) Say uh, where's the bathroom? 

JERRY

Bathroom uh, bathroom's uh right over there. 

BARRY

(turns looking in the direction Jerry mentioned) Oh, great. 

JERRY

Did you see that? 

ELAINE

See what? 

GEORGE

Yes, I saw that. 

ELAINE

What? 

JERRY

What was all that sniffing? 

ELAINE

I don't know. 

JERRY

You don't think...? 

ELAINE

Oh, no! Come on Jerry. 

GEORGE

He was definitely sniffing. 

JERRY

I mean what if, what if, this this guy has got all my money. Plus he has got some Kramer's money with him. This guy could write checks to himself right out of my account. 

ELAINE

No, I have known this guy since college. He doesn't do drugs. 

JERRY

Then, what was all that sniffing? 

ELAINE

Maybe it's the cold weather. 

JERRY

Today's not cold. 

GEORGE

All right, I gotta get going. My parents are expecting me. 

ELAINE

(making fun of George as he leaves) Don't forget to wash your hands before supper. 

FRANK

Why do you need all that ketchup for? 

GEORGE

This is my ketchup. I bought this ketchup just so I could have as much as I want. 

FRANK

So I, I talked to Phil Casacof today. 

ESTELLE

Phil Casacof? 

FRANK

Yeah, you know my friend, the bra salesman. He says they are looking maybe to put somebody on so I got you an interview next Friday with his boss. 

GEORGE

Next Friday, what time? 

FRANK

2 o'clock. 

GEORGE

That's my whole afternoon! I was going to look for sneakers. 

FRANK

You can look for sneakers the next day! 

ESTELLE

He doesn't know anything about bras. 

GEORGE

I know a little. Besides, what do you have to know? 

FRANK

Well, it wouldn't hurt to go in the and be able to discuss it intelligently. Maybe you should take a look at a few bras? (to Estelle) Where is you bra? Give him a bra to look. 

ESTELLE

I am not giving him a bra. 

FRANK

Why not? 

ESTELLE

Because I don't need him looking at my bra. 

FRANK

Why, so he'll go to the interview and he wouldn't know what he's talking about!?! 

GEORGE

Do we have to...? 

FRANK

You don't even know what they're made from. 

GEORGE

They are made from lycra-spandex. 

FRANK

Get out of here! Lycra-spandex? 

ESTELLE

I think they are made from lycra-spandex. 

FRANK

Wanna bet? How much you wanna bet? 

ESTELLE

I'm not betting! 

FRANK

Take a look. 

ESTELLE

All right, I'll get a bra. 

FRANK

(Yelling to Estelle as she leaves)I don't know what the big problem is getting a bra?! 

GEORGE

She doesn't want to get a bra. 

FRANK

I'm not saying go to the library and read the whole history, but it wouldn't kill you to know a little bit about it. 

GEORGE

All right, it wouldn't kill me. 

FRANK

How long it takes to find a bra? What's going on in there? You ask me to get a pair of underwear, I'm back in two seconds...you know about the uh cup sizes and all? They have different cups. 

GEORGE

Yea I-I know about the cups. 

FRANK

You got the A, the B, the C and the D. That's the biggest. 

GEORGE

I know the D is the biggest. I've based my whole life on knowing that the D is the biggest. 

ESTELLE

Here, here's the bra. 

FRANK

Let me see it. 

ESTELLE

(reading the bra) 100% lycra-spandex. 

FRANK

Let me see it. 

ESTELLE

I told you. Here, think you know everything? 

FRANK

Hmm, that's surprising. All right, what else? You got the cups in the front, two loops in the back. All right, a guess that's about it. 

GEORGE

I got it. Cups in the front, loops in the back. (puts the bra on the table) 

ESTELLE

You got ketchup on it! 

KRAMER

Sniffing, what do you mean sniffing? 

JERRY

Sniffing, with his nose. 

KRAMER

Jerry, he probably had a cold. 

JERRY

No, I asked him. 

KRAMER

So, what are you saying? 

JERRY

I don't know, you know, what if...? 

KRAMER

Drugs? You think he's on drugs? 

JERRY

I don't know. 

KRAMER

Jerry 

JERRY

All I know he was sniffing. 

KRAMER

Listen, we went in on a CD together. 

JERRY

I know. 

KRAMER

And Newman gave you money too. So, I didn't even meet this guy. You know, we trusted you. 

JERRY

Look, it doesn't necessarily mean anything yet, it just means he was sniffing. 

KRAMER

Well, what else? Was he nervous? Did he use a lot of slang? Did he use the word 'man'? 

JERRY

No, he didn't use 'man'. 

KRAMER

I mean when he was leaving did he say 'I'm splittin''? 

JERRY

No, but in one point he did use the bathroom. 

KRAMER

Whoh! 

JERRY

Do you think that's a bad sign? 

KRAMER

Yes!! Yes, that's what they do! They live in the bathroom! All right, what are we going to do? We are going to get our money back, right? 

JERRY

I don't know. (takes off his sweater) This sweater really itches me. You want it? 

KRAMER

(grabbing the sweater) Yeah. 

ELAINE

Hello.... hello, oh... 

JAKE

Well, you notice anything? 

ELAINE

You have cleaned out the whole apartment and you're making dinner. You're perfect, you're a perfect man. 

JAKE

Ooh... 

ELAINE

Did anyone call? 

JAKE

You got a few messages, I wrote them down. 

ELAINE

Where are they? 

JAKE

Lets see, they are (looking for the paper; finds it; hands it to Elaine) here they are. 

ELAINE

Thank you. (looking at the messages) Oh ya, heh, I'll call you back. Ooh, Myra had the baby! Oh, my God that's wonderful! Who called? 

JAKE

She did. 

ELAINE

She did? Oh, that's so great! 

JAKE

Where do you keep the corkscrew? 

ELAINE

In the drawer on the right. Hmm... 

JAKE

What? 

ELAINE

Nah it's nothing. 

JAKE

What is it? 

ELAINE

It's nothing. 

JAKE

Tell me. 

ELAINE

Well, I was just curious why you didn't use an exclamation point? 

JAKE

What are you talking about? 

ELAINE

See, right here you wrote 'Myra had the baby', but you didn't use an exclamation point. 

JAKE

So? 

ELAINE

So, it's ya nothing. Forget it, forget it, I just find it curious. 

JAKE

What's so curious about it? 

ELAINE

Well, I mean if one of your close friends had a baby and I left you a message about it, I would use an exclamation point. 

JAKE

Well, maybe I don't use my exclamation points as haphazardly as you do. 

ELAINE

You don't think that someone having a baby warrants an exclamation point. 

JAKE

Hey look, I just chalked down the message. I didn't know I was required to capture the mood of each caller. 

ELAINE

I just thought you would be a little more excited about a friend of mine having a baby. 

JAKE

Ok, I'm excited. I just don't happen to like exclamation points. 

ELAINE

Well, you know Jake, you should learn to use them. Like the way I'm talking right now, I would put an exclamation points at the end of all these sentences! On this one! And on that one! 

JAKE

Well, you can put one on this one: I'm leaving! 

JERRY

You're out of your mind you know that. 

ELAINE

Why? 

JERRY

It's an exclamation point! It's a line with a dot under it. 

ELAINE

Well, I felt a call for one. 

JERRY

A call for one, you know I thought I've heard everything. I've never heard a relationship being affected by a punctuation. 

ELAINE

I found it very troubling that he didn't use one. 

JERRY

George was right. Didn't take you long. 

KRAMER

Anything new with that guy on drugs? 

ELAINE

Oh, he's not on drugs. 

KRAMER

Then why the sniffing? Who walks around (sniff, sniff) sniffing? 

ELAINE

All right, here, you call him right now. See if he's sniffing right now. 

JERRY

Good idea. (Jerry calls Barry's office) 

PHONE

Prophet and Goldstein. 

JERRY

Yes, I'd like to speak to Barry Prophet, please. 

VOICE

I'm sorry he's out of town this week. 

JERRY

Out of town? 

VOICE

Yes, he went to South America. 

JERRY

South America? 

KRAMER

South America? 

JERRY

I'll call back, thank you. (hangs up the phone) He went to South America! 

KRAMER

Yyyeeaaah!! 

ELAINE

So what? 

JERRY

Who goes to South America? 

ELAINE

People go to South America. 

JERRY

Yeah, and they come back with things taped to they're large intestine. 

ELAINE

So, because of a few bad apples you're gonna impugn an entire continent? 

JERRY

Yes, I'm impugning a continent. 

KRAMER

Well, I say we're going to take our money right now! 

NEWMAN

Hey, hey... 

JERRY

Hello Newman. 

NEWMAN

Hello Jerry. (to Kramer) So, any news? 

KRAMER

Yeah, he skipped out and *ptruut* went to South America! 

NEWMAN

South America?! (to Jerry) What kind of snow blower you get us mixed up with? 

ELAINE

Look it, gentlemen. The fact remains you still have no proof. This is all speculation and hearsay. 

KRAMER

Wait, there is one way to find out. We set up a sting. You know like Abscam. Like Abscam Jerry. 

ELAINE

Ohh, what are you gonna do? You gonna put on phony beards and dress-up like Arab sheiks and sit around in some hotel room. I mean come on... 

JERRY

Wait a second. Maybe there is someway we can tempt him and find out... 

NEWMAN

If we put our three heads together we should come up with something. 

KRAMER

What's today? 

NEWMAN

It's Thursday. 

KRAMER

Really? Feels like Tuesday. 

NEWMAN

Tuesday has no feel. Monday has a feel, Friday has a feel, Sunday has a feel.... 

KRAMER

I feel Tuesday and Wednesday... 

JERRY

All right, shut up the both of you! You're making me nervous. Where is he already? He should've been out of work by now. 

NEWMAN

Hey, you know this is kind of fun. 

KRAMER

Yeah, maybe we oughta become private detectives... 

JERRY

Yeah maybe you should. 

KRAMER

Maybe I will. 

NEWMAN

Yeah, me too. 

JERRY

All right, what are you gonna say to him? 

KRAMER

Just gonna find out if he's interested. 

NEWMAN

Hey, hey maybe I should go with him? 

JERRY

No, you stay here in the car. 

NEWMAN

Who made you the leader? 

JERRY

All right Newman, one more peep outta you, you're out of the whole operation! 

NEWMAN

Alright. 

JERRY

There he is. He's going into that bar. 

KRAMER

All right, I'm going in. 

JERRY

Be careful Kramer. 

NEWMAN

I shoulda gone in with him. 

JERRY

No, you stay here in the car. I may need you. 

NEWMAN

What you need me in the car for? 

JERRY

I might need you to get me a soda. 

KRAMER

I'll have a brewsky, Charlie. 

BARTENDER

The name's Mitch. 

KRAMER

Oh, there's nothing like a cold one after a long day, eh? 

BARRY

Yeah. 

KRAMER

Oh yeah, I've been known to drink a beer or two. But then again, I've been known to do a lot of things. (Waiter opens the counter which hits Kramer on the head) Cigarette? 

BARRY

(sniffs) No, I never touch them. 

KRAMER

I suck'em down like Coca-Cola. Well here's to feeling good all the time. (Kramer drinks the beer and smokes the cigarette at the same time. Barry sniffs) Looks like you've got yourself a little cold there, eh fella? 

BARRY

I don't think so. 

KRAMER

Me neither. 

JERRY

You should try this new dental floss Glide, it's fantastic. 

NEWMAN

I use dental tape. 

JERRY

You should try this. 

NEWMAN

I don't wanna. 

JERRY

Not even once? 

NEWMAN

No. 

JERRY

You're an idiot. 

NEWMAN

Why, because I use dental tape? 

JERRY

Right, anyone who uses dental tape is an idiot. 

KRAMER

South America? 

BARRY

Yeah, yeah. 

KRAMER

Well that's a burgeoning continent. 

BARRY

Well, they are expanding their economic base. 

KRAMER

Tell me about it. 

BARRY

(sniffs) Excuse me, I gotta goto the bathroom. 

KRAMER

I'm hip. 

BARRY

Hip to the what? 

KRAMER

To the whole scene. (sniff) 

BARRY

What scene? 

KRAMER

The bathroom scene. (moves his knows as you would if you sniffed) 

BARRY

Listen, don't take this personally, but when I'm coming back I'm sitting over there. 

KRAMER

What ever turns you on. 

NEWMAN

No, no I don't like it. 

JERRY

What do you mean you don't like it? How could you not like it? 

NEWMAN

I like the thick tape. 

BARRY

Heeyy!! What kind of a nut are you? 

FARKUS

So, basically George the job here is quite simple. Selling bras. 

GEORGE

Well, that interests me very much Mr. Farkus.Very much indeed, sir. 

FARKUS

Have you ever sold a woman's line before? 

GEORGE

No, but um I have very good report with women, very good, comfortable. And from the first time I laid eyes on a brassieres, I was enthralled. 

FARKUS

Hum. tell me about it. 

GEORGE

Well, I was 14 years old. I was in my friends bathroom. His mother's brassieres were hanging on the shower rod and I picked it up, studied it. I thought, I like this. I didn't know what way or what level, but I knew: I wanted to be around brassieres. 

FARKUS

That's an incredible story. You have a remarkable passion for brassieres. 

GEORGE

Well, they're more than an underwear to me Mr. Farkus. Two cups in the front, two loops in the back. How do they do it? 

FARKUS

Well, I think I can say, barring some unforeseen incident, that you will have a very bright future here at E.D. Granmont. 

GEORGE

Thank you Mr.Farkus, thank you very much indeed sir. 

FARKUS

See you monday 9 o'clock. 

GEORGE

If you don't mind, sir. I'll be here at 8. 

FARKUS

Excellent. 

GEORGE

So long, Mr. Farkus. 

GRANMONT

What you're think you're doing? 

GEORGE

Oh, nothing... 

GRANMONT

Farkus, get out here! 

FARKUS

Yes, Ms. De Granmont? 

GRANMONT

Farkus, who is this pervert little weasel? 

FARKUS

Uh, this is Costanza, he's our new bra salesman. (George's offers his hand to shake) He's supposed to start on monday. 

GRANMONT

If he's here on monday, you're not. Take a pick. 

FARKUS

(to George): Get out! (to Ms. De Granmont) I'm terribly sorry Ms. De Granmont... 

ELAINE

You wanted to see me, Mr. Lippman? 

LIPPMAN

I was just uh going over the Jake Jarmel book and I understand you worked with him very closely on this. 

ELAINE

Yes (clears her throat) yes I did. 

LIPPMAN

And uh, anyway I was just reading your final edit and um, there seems to be an inordinate number of exclamation points. 

ELAINE

Uh well um, I felt that the writing lacked certain emotion and intensity. 

LIPPMAN

Ah, (reads an excerpt) 'It was damp and chilly afternoon, so I decided to put on my sweatshirt!' 

ELAINE

Right, well... 

LIPPMAN

You put exclamation point after sweatshirt? 

ELAINE

That's that's correct, I-I felt that the character doesn't like to be ch-ch-chilly... 

LIPPMAN

I see, (reads another excerpt) 'I pulled the lever on the machine, but the Clark bar didn't come out!' Exclamation point? 

ELAINE

Well, yeah, you know how frustrating that can be when you keep putting quarters and quarters in to machine and then (prrt) nothing comes out... 

LIPPMAN

Get rid of the exclamation points... 

ELAINE

Ok, ok ok ... 

LIPPMAN

I hate exclamation points... 

ELAINE

...ok I'll just.... 

JERRY

'Dear Barry. Consider this letter to be official termination of our relationship effective immediately.' 

KRAMER

Exclamation point. 

ELAINE

You still have no proof. 

KRAMER

Elaine, he was sniffing like crazy around me. 

JERRY

'I will expect all funds in form of cashier checks no later than the 18th'. 

KRAMER

Double exclamation point! 

NEWMAN

Will that take care of ours too? 

JERRY

Yeah, I'll give you yours as soon as I get my money back. 

NEWMAN

Hey, you want me to mail it? I'm on my way out anyway. 

JERRY

Yeah, thanks. 

NEWMAN

It'll be my pleasure. 

NEWMAN

See'ya later. 

JERRY

You know this... 

KRAMER

Hey, Ralph. 

JERRY

Hi Ralph. 

RALPH

What's up fellas? That'll be 14.30. 

JERRY

All right. 

KRAMER

Mushrooms, you got mushrooms Jerry? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

KRAMER

What's the matter? You've got a cold? 

RALPH

No man (sniffs again) Kramer, what is this? 

KRAMER

It's a sweater. 

RALPH

What is it made out of? 

KRAMER

I don't know, Jerry gave it to me. 

JERRY

Mohair, I think. 

RALPH

Mohair, that figures, I'm allergic to mohair. 

JERRY

You mean you just started sniffing? 

RALPH

Yeah, mohair does it to me every time. 

JERRY

I was wearing that sweater in the coffee shop when Barry came in. 

KRAMER

Jerry, I was wearing it in the bar. 

ELAINE

The sweater! The sweater made him sniff! See, I told you he wasn't a drug addict. 

JERRY

Oh no! The letter, Newman, it's got exclamation points all over it! 

KRAMER

Not to mention the picture of him on the toilet. 

JERRY

The what?? 

NEWMAN

After you. 

WOMAN

Thank you. 

WOMAN

Get your hands off of me! Johnny!!! Johnny! 

FRANK

What do you mean you felt the material? What, with your fingers like this? 

GEORGE

So what, what is so bad about that? 

ESTELLE

Who goes around feeling people's material? What can be gained by feeling a person's material? It's insanity! 

FRANK

What ever happened to 'Why, that's a lovely dress you have on. May I have this dance?'!! 

ELAINE

You are really lucky Newman never mailed that letter. 

JERRY

Sorry I'm late, I just came from a meeting with my lawyer. 

ELAINE

What is this? 

JERRY

It's a letter from your friend Barry Prophet's lawyer. 

ELAINE

He is filing a chapter eleven. Why, what's going on, why is he filing a chapter eleven? 

JERRY

Bankruptcy, bankruptcy...as in I've taken your money and spent it on drugs! 

ELAINE

What do you mean, I thought it was the sweater. 

KRAMER

All right, What about the money? 

JERRY

What about the money? Apparently if I had dissolved my relationship with him prior to his filing chapter eleven, I've could've got the money back. Which I would've done, if a certain imbecile had been able to get to a mailbox and mail a letter!! 

NEWMAN

Pair of bear claws, please. 

WOMAN

Nice. 

JERRY

Think so? 

WOMAN

Yeah, what is it? 

JERRY

Half silk, half cotton, half linen. How can you go wrong? 

STAN

...And then baby's head comes out, and I'm screaming and my brother who's been videotaping the whole thing turns green, his eyes roll up in his head and he blacks out, he drops the camera, the camera breaks, and then, the placenta comes flying out. 

ELAINE

Whoa. 

STAN

And then doctor says... 

JERRY

(interrupting) Thanks, that's enough. 

STAN

Will you look at that kid. Sucking away. Sucking like there's no tomorrow. Suck, suck, suck... 

JERRY

(Looking away) Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

STAN

Look at that Jerry, look at that. Sucking, sucking... 

JERRY

Yeah, I looked. I saw. 

STAN

This doesn't make you uncomfortable, does it? 

JERRY

No, Uncomfortable? Not at all. (ASIDE TO ELAINE) My friend's wife's breast sticking out - why would that make me uncomfortable? 

STAN

Look at him. 

JERRY

So how long do they do this? 

STAN

Jus, a year or two. 

JERRY

No break? 

STAN

After that comes the weaning. 

JERRY

So after the sucking, comes the weaning. 

ELAINE

First the sucking then the weaning. 

JERRY

Well, you gotta wean. 

STAN

Gotta wean. 

ELAINE

Must wean. 

GEORGE

What about that spot I got? 

JERRY

Yeah, I saw the spot. 

GEORGE

You open the door to the car, boom, you walk right into the hospital. Eh, You can't beat that spot. (starts doing a little dance) I am on a roll. I'm just willing these great parking spots. 

JERRY

George... 

GEORGE

Maybe the baby would like to see my spot. A positive, uplifting message to start his life out with. Huh, You can still get a great space in this city - if you apply yourself. 

JERRY

(to Elaine) Where's Kramer? Shouldn't he be here by now. 

ELAINE

Did you give him the room number? 

JERRY

Ya, 1397. 

KRAMER

1937, 1937, 1937... 

PATIENT

Excuse me. Do you know where the elevator is? 

KRAMER

Uh ya, it's right around the corner there. 

KRAMER

1937. 

KRAMER

Oh! God, It's a Pig man! A pig man! 

STAN

..So anyway, Jerry, Elaine, we have something we want to ask you. 

GEORGE

You gotta look at this. I pulled it in perfectly equidistant from the car in front of me and the car behind me. 

JERRY

Will you shut up George. 

ELAINE

I'm taking a cab home. I can't this anymore. 

JERRY

You were saying Stan? I-I'm sorry about that. 

STAN

Myra and I would like you and Elaine to be the Godparents of Steven. 

ELAINE

Huuh, Wow. 

JERRY

Me? Godfather? 

STAN

Yes. 

JERRY

(a la 'Don Corleone') Never go against the family, Elaine. 

ELAINE

What? 

KRAMER

Hey, I just saw a pig man! A pig man! Ya know he was sleeping and then he woke up and he looked up at me an-and he made this horrible sound, this (Quells like a pig). 

GEORGE

Kramer, what the hell are you talking about? 

KRAMER

I'm talking about the pig man. I went into the wrong room and there he was. 

GEORGE

A pig-man? 

KRAMER

A pig-man. Half pig, half man! 

ELAINE

That's great Kramer... So-So, anyway, tell us what's involved in being a Godparent. 

JERRY

(a la 'Don Corleione') Elaine, never ask me about my business!.... (SHEEPISH) 'Godfather.' 

STAN

The most important thing is you help with the bris. 

JERRY

The bris? 

KRAMER

A bris? You mean circumcision? 

STAN

Ya. 

KRAMER

I would advise against that. 

ELAINE

Wha, Kramer. It's a tradition. 

KRAMER

Ya well, so was uh sacrificing virgins to appease the gods, but we don't do that anymore. 

JERRY

Well, maybe we should. 

GEORGE

(knocks on the window) Hey, why are all those people milling around my car? 

KRAMER

I don't know. 

JERRY

Maybe they're admiring your spot. 

KRAMER

They're all looking up. 

GEORGE

Hey, there's a guy up the roof. 

KRAMER

Whoa. That's the guy that I told where the elevator was. 

GEORGE

Oh well, I hope he doesn't jum... 

STAN

Oh my! 

GEORGE

My car! My caaaaarrrr! 

ELAINE

A Mohel! What the hell is a Mohel? 

JERRY

A Mohel is the person that performs the circumcision. 

ELAINE

Where am I going to find a Mohel? (LOOKING THROUGH THE YELLOW PAGES, MUTTERING) Motels, models... How do you find a Mohel? 

JERRY

Oh, finding a Mohel is a piece of cake. Any idiot can find a Mohel. I have to hold the baby while they do it. That's a tough job. How would you like that? 

ELAINE

Hey Jerry, you ever seen one? 

JERRY

You mean that wasn't uh. 

ELAINE

Yeah. 

JERRY

No.. you? 

ELAINE

Ya. 

JERRY

What'd you think? 

ELAINE

(shakes her head) No, had no face, no personality. It was like a martian. But hey, you know that's me. 

JERRY

Hey. 

GEORGE

Well I just got the estimate. It's going to cost more to fix that roof than the car's worth, So I'm going over to see that hospital administrator today. Someone is gonna pay for this damage and it's not gonna be me. 

JERRY

Ah, you're screwed. 

GEORGE

I know, swan dives from twenty floors up, lands right on top. What do I got a bulls eye up there? He couldn't move over two feet? Land on the sidewalk. It's city property. 

ELAINE

Well I have to interview a Mohel. 

JERRY

How about our little Elaine huh? Attended the finest finishing schools on the Eastern seaboard. Equestrian competitions. Debutante balls. Look at her now. Interviewing Mohels. 

KRAMER

YEA! 

JERRY

What's the matter? 

ELAINE

Are you alright? 

KRAMER

Don't even question my instincts, because my instincts are honed. (RE:PAPER) Look at that. 

JERRY

What now? 

KRAMER

Look look. 

JERRY

(Kramer shows Jerry and Elaine the paper) 'Hospital receives grant to conduct DNA research'..' Government funds genetic research at area hospital' ... Yeah, so? 

KRAMER

pig-man, baby. pig-man. 

ELAINE

If I hear about this pig-man one more time... 

KRAMER

Hey, I'm tellin ya the pig-man is alive. The government has been experimenting with pig-men since the fifties. 

JERRY

Oh, will you stop it. Just because a hospital studying DNA research doesn't mean they're creating a race of mutant pig-men! 

KRAMER

Jerry wake up to reality. It's a military thing. They're probably creating a whole army of pig warriors. 

GEORGE

I tell you something. I wish there were pig-men. You get a few of these pig-men walking around suddenly I'm looking a whole lot better. Then if somebody wants to fix me up at least they could say, 'Hey he's no pig-man!' 

JERRY

Believe me, there'd be plenty of women going for these pig-men. Whatever the deformity is there's always some group of perverts that's attracted to it. 'Oo that little tail really turns me on.' 

ELAINE

(MUMBLES) That's just about enough 

JERRY

Oh, what's the matter this doesn't interest you? 

ELAINE

Oh, no, it's fascinating, but could you do me a favor, could ya tape the rest of the pig-men and the women who love them discussion and I'll listen to it the next time I'm here. I've gotta go find a Mohel. 

KRAMER

You know, you should call this off, Elaine. It's a barbaric ritual. 

ELAINE

Well, perhaps one day when the pig-men roam free it will be stopped Kramer. Until then, off with their heads. 

GEORGE

But Kramer, isn't it a question of hygiene? 

KRAMER

It's a myth. Besides, it makes sex more pleasurable. 

GEORGE

Yeah. So how does that help me? 

JERRY

(TO GEORGE) Hey George, you ever see one? 

GEORGE

Yeah, my roommate in college. 

JERRY

So what'd you think? 

GEORGE

(thinks for a second) I got used to it. 

JERRY

Alright, I'm waiting. I-I want to see the pig-man. Show me the pig- man. 

KRAMER

Oh, don't worry. I'm gonna show you, and you'll never be the same. 

JERRY

Maybe he's just a guy with a nose like this. (holds his nose up like a pig) You know a lot of people have a nose like this, they're not necessarily pig-men. 

KRAMER

Believe me, Jerry, somewhere in this hospital the anguished 'oink' of pig-man cries out for help. 

JERRY

Well, if I hear an anguished 'oink', I'm outta here. I-I don't see any pig-men. Look (HE POINTS AT PASSERBY) Human, human, human... (HE LOOKS DOWN CORRIDOR, WITH ALARM.) (WITH MOCK ALARM) Wait a second! (Grabs Kramer) 

KRAMER

What?! 

JERRY

Oh, it's George. 

GEORGE

Alright the administrator's on the third floor. I'll meet you guys back at the car. 

KRAMER

Wait wait George. You got room in the car for the pig-man huh? 

GEORGE

The pig-man can take the bus. 

KRAMER

George, if the pig-man had a car, he would give you a ride. 

GEORGE

How do you know? What if pig-man had a two-seater? 

KRAMER

Be realistic George. 

GEORGE

I'll tell you what, if pig-man shows up, we'll squeeze him in. I'll see you later. 

KRAMER

Yea. 

SWEEDLER

Mr. Costanza, come in, come in. It's been a very trying couple of days around the hospital. Doctors, patients, everyone, just grief stricken over this unfortunate occurrence. 

GEORGE

Well, I join them in their grief. 

SWEEDLER

Horrible thing. Flew right past the children's wing. All the sick children, in the playroom, looking out the window, just traumatized by the incident. Apparently, they thought he was flying. You know how children are, 'Oh look. A man is flying. A man is flying' And then, splat... 

GEORGE

That's where I come in. Umm, on splat. Uh, you see, Mrs. Sweedler, or is it hospital administrator Sweedler? 

SWEEDLER

Mrs. Sweedler's fine. 

GEORGE

Mrs. Sweedler thank you. Y-You see, this tragedy affected me in a very, very personal way. 

SWEEDLER

How is that? 

GEORGE

Yes, well you see, the deceased landed on my car. The uh splat, as it were, actually occurred on the roof of my car. Now of course I can't help but feel that had it been a convertible this whole tragedy might have been averted but I've never been the kind of guy to buy a convertible, what with the baldness and everything. 

SWEEDLER

Well I have known bald men who owned convertibles. They wore a hat. 

GEORGE

Yes but then everything is all pulled down and it's jus.. Anyway. The damage, unfortunately, has marred an otherwise fine automobile, rendering it virtually undriveable. 

SWEEDLER

(STIFFENING) Yes, well, that is a shame. 

GEORGE

Yes, a shame. That is exactly how I would put it. Now Mrs. Sweedler, with all due discretion and sensitivity, and taking in the whole scope of the situation, I just can't help but think that, the hospital is somehow responsible for compensating the other, still living 'victim' of horrendous, horrendous tragedy. 

SWEEDLER

Mr.Constanza. 

GEORGE

Yes. 

SWEEDLER

A man plummeted tragically to his ultimate demise - 

GEORGE

Yes. 

SWEEDLER

... and you greedily, callously want to profit from it? 

GEORGE

(PULLING OUT ESTIMATE OUT OF HIS POCKET) Well, profit. I think you'll see from the estimate that I'm not really profiting that much. They might be a little high, but.. 

SWEEDLER

Get out! Get out, now! Get out of my office. 

GEORGE

Should I leave this..? 

SWEEDLER

GET OUT! 

KRAMER

Excuse me. What happened to the man, that was in this room before? 

RESIDENT

I don't know what you're talking about. 

KRAMER

You know. (HE PUSHES HIS NOSE UP WITH HIS THUMB). 

RESIDENT

No. 

KRAMER

(STILL HOLDING HIS NOSE UP ) This doesn't look familiar to you? 

RESIDENT

Uh, Sir? 

KRAMER

Look, I know what's going on. The oink, oink. 

RESIDENT

Yes well if you'll excuse me. I really have some patients I have to attend to. 

KRAMER

(TOUGH TALKING) Now listen to me you little quack, There was a half man, half pig in that room over there. Now where is he?! Where is he?! 

RESIDENT

Half-what? 

KRAMER

You know what I mean - pork, sausage, (A LA PORKY PIG) A-deek-a-deek-a- deek th-th-th-that's all folks. 

RESIDENT

I think he's been released. 

KRAMER

He's lying. 

JERRY

Alright Kramer, enough of this. Let's go find George. 

KRAMER

Alright you go ahead. 

JERRY

Kramer. 

JERRY

Where's the Mohel? 

ELAINE

He'll be here. 

JERRY

He's late already. 

ELAINE

Relax. You'd think you were getting whacked. 

JERRY

I don't know why he asked me to be the Godfather. We're not even that close of friends. Just cause we're on the softball team, I'm the pitcher, he's the catcher he thinks we have a special relationship? 

ELAINE

I thought pitchers and catchers did have a special rapport. 

JERRY

Well maybe in hardball with all the signals and everything but I'm just lobbing it in. We don't have any conferences. He doesn't come out to the mound and encourage me. 

ELAINE

What about me? I mean I just watched a few games with her sitting in the stands. 

JERRY

Don't they have any closer friends. They're level jumping on our friendship. 

ELAINE

Yes it is level jumping. 

GEORGE

So uh... been to a bris before? 

WOMAN

No. 

GEORGE

I've been to a few of em. If you uh start to get woozy later, which is quite common, stay close to me. I'll get you through it. (chuckles) 

WOMAN

I'm a cardiologist. I think I'll manage. 

GEORGE

Oh. 

KRAMER

We're not talking about a manicure. Imagine, this is going to be his first memory. Of his parents just standing there while some stranger (Does some motions of cutting; Myra sobs more) cutting off a piece of his manhood and then serves a catered lunch. 

STAN

(Seeing Myra run away sobbing) Myra? 

ELAINE

Kramer, what's the matter with you? 

KRAMER

Me? 

ELAINE

(to everyone) Oh, that's the Mohel. 

ALL

(ADLIB) It's the Mohel! the Mohel is here! Thank God, the Mohel is here. 

ELAINE

Hello. 

MOHEL

(to Elaine) Hello, Hello (shaking hands with Jerry) Hello, I'm the Mohel. 

JERRY

Hello. 

MOHEL

(cont'd) (shakes Stan's hand) It's very nice to meet you all... (A PAN CLANGS TO THE GROUND. THE MOHEL SNAPS.) Oh! What was that?!? Jeez. Scared the hell out of me. My god. I almost had a heart attack! (THE CROWD GROWS UNEASY) (CALMING DOWN) Ok, I'm fine, I'm fine. Anyway, we're here to perform the mitzvah of the bris... (The Baby starts crying) (WITH INCREASING TENSION) ...Is the baby gonna cry like that? Is that how the baby cries, with the loud, sustained, squealing cry, 'cause that could pose a problem. Do you have any control of your child 'cause this will be the time to exercise it when baby is crying in that high-pitched, squealing tone that can drive you insane!!! 

ELAINE

Did you find the place alright? 

MOHEL

Did I find it alright? Could you send me to a more dangerous neighborhood? I'm dreading walking back to the subway, someone shouldn't crack me over the head and steal my bag, Because I'll be lying there and people will spit on me and empty my pockets. I'll be lying in the gutter like a bum, like a dog, like a mutt, like a mongrel, like an animal! God forbid anybody should help me or call an ambulance. Oh no, that's too much trouble to pick up a phone and press a few buttons. Ahh! What's the point. 

ELAINE

(setting down her glass) Oh, ya haha. 

MOHEL

(TO ELAINE INTERRUPTING) Darling, you see where that glass is? How that glass is near the edge of the table. You got the whole table there to put the glass, why you chose the absolute edge, so half the glass is hanging off the table, you breath and that glass falls over, then you're gonna have broken glass on the carpet, embedded in the carpet fibers, deep, deep in the shag, broken glass, bits of broken glass that you never get out. you can't get it out with a vacuum cleaner. Even on your hands and knees with a magnifying glass, you can't get all the pieces, and then you think you got it all and two years later, you're walkin' barefoot and you step on a piece of broken glass and you kill yourself, is that what you want? I don't think you want that, is it? .. Do ya? Huh? 

ELAINE

(to Myra) He's very highly recommended. So... 

MOHEL

(to George) You're holding the baby? 

GEORGE

(getting up out of his chair to get out of the Mohel's way) No, No. 

MOHEL

Hello! Who's holding the baby?!? Who's holding the baby? 

JERRY

(uncertain) Yeah. I'm holding the baby. 

ELAINE

(pushing Jerry over to the Mohel) Ok, go. 

JERRY

I'm going. 

ELAINE

Go. 

JERRY

I'm going. 

ELAINE

C'mon 

JERRY

Don't push me. 

MOHEL

Okay. you sit here. Now I need the baby. Bring me the baby. I need the baby! 

KRAMER

No, I'm not going to let this happen. 

ALL

(numerous voices) Kramer! Let go of the baby! Kramer! 

MOHEL

People compose yourselves. (Shouting as the struggle ends) This is a bris. We are performing a bris here, not a burlesque show. This is not a school play! This is not a baggy pants farce! This is a bris. An sacred, ancient ceremony, symbolizing the covenant between God and Abraham... or something. (The Mohel opens his bag to start the process but drops it and his instruments fall out. People attempt to help him out) No! Don't touch it! Don't touch a thing! 

ELAINE

Ok. 

MOHEL

(muttering to Jerry).. I coulda been a kosher butcher like my brother. The money's good. There's a union, with benefits. And, cows have no families. You make a mistake with a cow, you move on with your life... Anyway. 

JERRY

Hurry up George! Step on it! 

GEORGE

Alright, alright! 

JERRY

That damn Mohel - he circumcised my finger! The Mohel circumcised my finger! 

ELAINE

You flinched. 

JERRY

Flinched? I did not flinch. George, did I flinch? 

ELAINE

Oh how would he know. He blacked out. He fainted. 

GEORGE

It was very traumatic. The last thing I remember is you flinching. Then, everything went black. 

JERRY

Who's got a tissues? I need more tissues! Look at this thing. It's my phone finger! 

GEORGE

Be careful, you're getting blood all over the car. 

KRAMER

What about the baby? 

JERRY

Oh the baby's fine. They just took him to the hospital as a precautionary measure. But look at me. I'm the one who's hurt. 

ELAINE

Would you stop it? You're just gonna need a few stitches. 

JERRY

A few stitches? I've never had stitches. I'll be deformed. I can't live with that. It goes against my whole personality. It's not me! 

GEORGE

Hey look a that - boy are you lucky - another great spot - right in front of the hospital. In an emergency yet! How lucky are you huh? Is that unbelievable? How unbelievable is that huh? Come on, give it to me, give it to me. 

GEORGE

I have never seen a Mohel like that. 

JERRY

That was a one in a million Mohel. 

ELAINE

I said I'm sorry. 

JERRY

Look at this. 

KRAMER

Oh you'll be ok. I'll see you later. 

GEORGE

Wha, where is he going? 

JERRY

Oh well if it isn't Shakey the Mohel! Nice job on the circumcision but it's not supposed to be a finger. 

MOHEL

(RE:JERRY) The circumcision was perfect. The finger was your fault! You flinched! 

JERRY

Oh who made you a Mohel? Whadya, get your degree from a matchbook? 

MOHEL

(HE MAKES A SUDDEN MOVEMENT) Ya See! He flinched again! 

JERRY

Nice Mohel picking, Elaine. You picked a helluva Mohel! 

MOHEL

One more peep out of you and I'll slice you up like a smoked sturgeon. 

JERRY

Oh don't threaten me, Butcher Boy. 

MOHEL

Butcher Boy?! 

JERRY

Ya what was this? (HE IMITATES MOHEL'S FLINCHING) 

MOHEL

What was this? (HE IMITATES JERRY) 

JERRY

It was not! 

ELAINE

Jerry, be careful. The Mohel's got a knife! 

STAN

(holding the Mohel back) Hey, hey what's going on out here? You two should be ashamed of yourselves, both of ya! 

MOHEL

Ah, blood. 

ELAINE

Oh, how's the baby? 

STAN

There's nothing wrong with the baby. 

MYRA

The circumcision went fine. 

MOHEL

Thank god the flincher didn't harm the baby. 

STAN

Amen. 

MOHEL

I will get you for this. This is my business, this is my life. No one ruins this for me. No one! (TO ELAINE) Here's my card. 

KRAMER

(off screen) Outta My Way! 

JERRY

(struggling to open a bottle with his bandaged finger) I can't do it. (A LA GODFATHER) Look what they did to my boy, They massacred my boy. 

ELAINE

You really do the worst Godfather I ever heard. You're not even close. 

JERRY

(walking over the the buzzer to answer it) Oh, that's the Flicks. 

GEORGE

(ON PHONE) It's a '76 Chevy Impala. They stole it right in front of the hospital. I saw the guy drive off in it. Well he's about five feet tall, hairless, pink complexion.. (Elaine puts her finger on her nose) looks like a pig. Yeah, alright alright, thank you, thank you. (Kramer enters) So any word from the 'pig-man'? 

KRAMER

No. 

GEORGE

No. And he's not a pig-man is he? 

KRAMER

NO, he's not.. Just a fat little mental patient. 

JERRY

Myra, Stan. 

MYRA

Don't touch him 

JERRY

What's the matter? 

STAN

You're out, Jerry. You're out as Godfather. You too, Elaine. You're both out. 

ELAINE

But I didn't do anything. 

STAN

No, no buts. We made up our minds. (turns to Kramer) We want Kramer. He showed us how much he cares about Steven. 

KRAMER

(Leaving: A LA GODFATHER) Don't ever go against the family Jerry. 

STAN

(grabbing Kramer's hand) Godfather. 

MYRA

(grabbing Kramer's other hand) Godfather. 

KRAMER

Yes 

JERRY

Professional tennis. To me I don't understand all the shushing. Why are they always shushing. Shh, shh. Don't the players know that we're there? Should we duck down behind the seats so they don't see us watching them? To me tennis is basically just ping-pong and the players are standing on the table. That's all it is. And that goofy scoring, you win one point and all the sudden you're up by 15. Two points, 30-love. 30-love. Sounds like an English call girl. 'That'll be 30, love... And could you be a little quieter next time, please, shh.'  

JERRY

Are these seats unbelievable or what?  

GEORGE

Where's the sunblock?  

JERRY

Here.  

GEORGE

25? You don't have anything higher?  

JERRY

What, are you on Mercury?  

GEORGE

I need higher. This has paba in it, I need paba-free.  

JERRY

You got a problem with paba?  

GEORGE

Yes, I have a problem with paba.  

JERRY

You don't even know what paba is.  

GEORGE

I know enough to stay away from it.  

ANNOUNCER

30-Love 

GEORGE

So are you going to Todd's party this weekend?  

JERRY

I'll go if someone else drives. You going?  

GEORGE

Gwen really wants to go.  

JERRY

You're bringing a date to a party?  

GEORGE

No good?  

JERRY

A party is a bad date situation. It doesn't matter who you're with. You could be with J. Edgar Hoover. You don't want to sit and talk with Hoover all night. You want to circulate. (Makes hand motions) Ho, ho, ho.  

GEORGE

Why'd you pick Hoover? Was he that interesting to talk to?  

JERRY

Well I would think, with the law enforcement and the cross dressing. Seems like an interesting guy.  

GEORGE

Yeah I guess. What can I do? I gotta take her with me. Todd introduced us, I'm obligated.  

JERRY

That woman is absolutely stunning.  

GEORGE

Who, the Croat? [the tennis player]  

JERRY

Not the Croat, the lineswoman. That is the most beautiful lineswoman I've ever seen.  

GEORGE

Yeah, she's a B.L.  

JERRY

B.L.?  

GEORGE

Beautiful lineswoman. Alright listen uh I'm going to go to the concession stand and get some real sunblock. You want anything? Jerry? (Jerry is staring at the lineswoman) Jerry?  

COWORKER

You know, I just heard the Lexington line is out.  

ELAINE

(annoyed) Uh, you are kidding me. How am I supposed to get to this meeting?  

COWORKER

Take a car service. We have an account.  

ELAINE

Oh forget it, I hate those. Everytime I take one, the driver will *not* stop talking to me. No matter how disinterested I seem he just keeps yakking away. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Why does everything always have to have a social componant? Now a stage coach, that would have been a good situation for me. Cause I'm in the coach, and the driver is way up there on the stage.  

COWORKER

Well you're not going to get a cab now. Four thirty in the afternoon? Read a magazine, keep your head down.  

ELAINE

Yea, I guess that could work.  

ANNOUNCER

And that is it. The match to Ms. Natalia Valdoni. Coming up next, mens single, but for now let's stop a minute and take a look at our beautiful tennis center backdrop.  

KRAMER

Hey, hey, it's George.  

ANNOUNCER

Holy cow it's a scorcher. Boy I bet you that guy can cover a lot of court.  

DRIVER

Dag Gavershole Plaza huh? (Elaine ignores him) Pendant Publishing, that's books right? (Elaine is annoyed and still ignoring him) Miss?  

ELAINE

Pardon me?  

DRIVER

Books, that's what you do?  

ELAINE

Yeah.  

DRIVER

Yeah, I don't read much myself, (Elaine is annoyed) well you know besides the paper. Yeah a lot of people read to relax, not me. You know what I do?  

ELAINE

You know I-I'm having a lot of trouble, um, hearing you back here. So...  

DRIVER

(Yelling) I said you know what I do (Elaine is very annoyed) when I want to relax? The Jumble. Hey uh do you make a book of Jumbles?  

ELAINE

I'm going to have to be honest with you. I'm going deaf.  

DRIVER

Going deaf?  

ELAINE

What?  

DRIVER

Oh I-I-I'm sorry.  

ELAINE

It can be very frustrating.  

DRIVER

Hey what about a hearing aid?  

ELAINE

Am I fearing AIDS? Oh, yeah sure, who isn't. But you know you gotta live your life.  

DRIVER

No, no I said. Ehhh, forget it. (Elaine looks pleased)  

JERRY

I can't take my eyes off that lineswoman. The woman is absolutely mesmerizing.  

GEORGE

Boy you are really smitten.  

JERRY

I gotta talk to her. What do you think?  

GEORGE

Cold? How are you going to do that? You're not one of those guys.  

JERRY

I'm going to psyche myself into it like those people that just walk across the hot coals.  

GEORGE

They're not mocked and humiliated when they get to the other side.  

JERRY

I have to. I won't be able to live with myself.  

GEORGE

Wait a minute Jerry, there's a bigger issue here. If you go through that wall and become one of those guys I'll be left here on this side. Take me with you.  

JERRY

I can't.  

GEORGE

What are you going to say?  

JERRY

I don't know, 'Hi'.  

GEORGE

(laughing) You think you're going to the other side with 'Hi'? You're not going to make it.  

RADIO

Base to 92 come in  

DRIVER

Yes this is 92  

RADIO

After this go back to city for a 6:00 pickup  

DRIVER

Righteo  

RADIO

794 Bleeker the party's Hanks. Tom Hanks.  

ELAINE

Tom Hanks? After me you're picking up Tom Hanks? I love him.  

DRIVER

So I guess your hearing goes in and out huh?  

ELAINE

(realizing he caught her) Yeah. Yes it does...  

DRIVER

Yeah. You know what I think? I think you made that whole thing up.  

ELAINE

No no, no no.  

DRIVER

Yeah yeah, I know your type. You're too good to make conversation with someone like me. Oh god forbid you could discuss the Jumbles. But to go so far as to pretend you're almost deaf, I mean that is truly disgusting. And Mr. Tom Hanks, may I say he too would be disgusted by your behavior.  

JERRY

Excuse me. (Woman ignores him) Excuse me? (Still ignores him) Oh that's nice. That's right ignore me. That's real polite. Yea nobody's even talking to you. All you big lineswoman. Oh you've got some kind of a cool job. I know your type thinking your too good for everyone, but it's women like you (woman turns around and notices him) oh well, what are you deaf?  

LAURA

Bingo.  

KRAMER

And you're saying she's deaf.  

JERRY

I'm not *saying* she's deaf, she's deaf.  

KRAMER

Can't hear a thing.  

JERRY

Can't hear a thing.  

KRAMER

And you're going to go out with her.  

JERRY

Yeah, isn't that something?  

ELAINE

Hey.  

KRAMER

Hey.  

KRAMER

Hey I know how to sign.  

JERRY

Really?  

KRAMER

Yeah when I was 8, I had a deaf cousin who lived with us for about a year. (signing as he speaks) So I haven't been able to do it in a while.  

ELAINE

What is this about?  

JERRY

I met this deaf lineswoman at the tennis match.  

ELAINE

You are kidding. That is amazing. (She pushes Jerry, Jerry falls back into Kramer.) I just took a car service from work and to get the driver to not talk to me, I pretended I was going deaf.  

JERRY

Wow good plan.  

ELAINE

Oh didn't work. He caught me hearing. Alright it's terrible, but I'm not a terrible person.  

KRAMER

No.  

ELAINE

No. When I shoo squirrels away, I always say 'get out of here'. I never ever throw things at them and try to injure them like other people.  

JERRY

That's nice.  

ELAINE

Yeah, and when I see freaks in the street I never, ever stare at them. Yet, I'm careful not to look away, see, because I want to make the freaks feel comfortable.  

JERRY

(turning to Kramer) That's nice for the freaks.  

ELAINE

Yeah, and I don't poof up my hair when I got to a movie so people behind me can see. I've got to make it up to this guy or I won't be able to live with myself. What can I do?  

JERRY

Why don't you get him some tickets or something, how about that friend of yours that works at the ticket agency.  

KRAMER

Yeah yeah Pete, he can get you great tickets to something.  

ELAINE

Really? 

KRAMER

Like a rock concert. Whatever you like.  

ELAINE

Oh great, thanks Kramer.  

KRAMER

You got it. Hey Jerry, do me a favor. The next time you see that lineswoman ask her how those ball boys get those jobs. I would love to be able to do that.  

JERRY

Kramer, I think perhaps you've overlooked one of the key aspects of this activity. It's ball *boys*, not ball men. There are no ball men.  

ELAINE

Yeah I think he's right. I've never seen a ball man.  

KRAMER

Well there ought to be ball men.  

JERRY

All right I'll talk to her. If you want to be a ball man go ahead, break the ball barrier. (Elaine drinks straight out of the orange juice container) Hey. 

ELAINE

Hey you know a friend of mine from work said that she saw George at the tennis match on TV yesterday.  

KRAMER

Yeah, yeah me too. Yeah he was at the snack bar eating a hot fudge sundae. He had it all over his face. He was wearing that chocolate on his face like a beard and they got in there real nice and tight. And he's... (Imitates scooping up ice cream. Elaine and Jerry laugh)  

GWEN

I'm sorry George.  

GEORGE

I don't understand things were going so great. What happened? Something must have happened.  

GWEN

It's not you, it's me.  

GEORGE

You're giving me the 'it's not you, it's me' routine? I invented 'it's not you, it's me'. Nobody tells me it's them not me, if it's anybody it's me.  

GWEN

All right, George, it's you.  

GEORGE

You're *damn* right it's me.  

GWEN

I was just trying to...  

GEORGE

I know what you were trying to do. Nobody does it better than me.  

GWEN

I'm sure you do it very well.  

GEORGE

Yes well unfortunately you'll never get the chance to find out.  

JERRY

But I thought things were going great.  

GEORGE

Yeah so did I.  

JERRY

Did she say why?  

GEORGE

No. She tried to give me the 'it's not you, it's me' routine.  

JERRY

But that's your routine.  

GEORGE

Yeah. Well aparently word's out.  

KRAMER

Hey, Georgie, I saw you on TV yesterday.  

GEORGE

Really? At the tennis match?  

KRAMER

Yeah you were at the snack bar eating a hot fudge sundae.  

GEORGE

Get out of here. I didn't see any cameras there.  

KRAMER

Oh, the cameras was, vrooom, there. The announcers, they made a couple of cracks about you.  

GEORGE

Cracks? What were they saying?  

KRAMER

That you had ice cream all over your face. They were talking about how funny you looked.  

GEORGE

Oh my god, maybe Gwen saw it. Maybe that's what did it.  

KRAMER

Well I'll tell you it wasn't a pretty sight.  

GEORGE

She must have seen me eating it on TV.  

JERRY

So she sees you with hot fudge on your face and she ends it? You really think she would be that superficial?  

GEORGE

Why not. I would be.  

JERRY

Hello... Oh hi dad... You saw him?... Really with the ice cream?... All right I'll talk to you later, bye.  

GEORGE

You're parents saw me on TV?  

JERRY

Yeah.  

GEORGE

This is nighmare. Kramer how long was I on?  

KRAMER

It felt like 8 seconds.  

GEORGE

One-one-thousand, two-one-thousand, three-one-thousand.  

ELAINE

I heard you *really* inhaled that thing. Did anyone tape it?  

GEORGE

Can we move on?  

JERRY

He thinks Gwen broke up with him because she saw him eating the ice cream on TV.  

ELAINE

Oh come on. If she's that superficial you don't want her.  

GEORGE

Yes I do.  

ELAINE

So I guess you're not going to Todd's party on Friday.  

GEORGE

Well I can't now, Gwen's going to be there.  

KRAMER

Well she should be the one that shouldn't go.  

JERRY

Well if a couple breaks up and have plans to go to a neutral place, who withdraws? What's the etiquette?  

KRAMER

Excellent question.  

JERRY

I think she should withdraw. She's the breaker, he's the breakee. He needs to get on with his life.  

ELAINE

I beg to differ.  

JERRY

Really.  

ELAINE

He's the *loser*. She's the victor. To the victor belong the spoils.  

JERRY

Well I don't care, I don't want to go anyway. I don't want to fight that traffic on Friday night.  

ELAINE

Well we can take the car service from my office.  

JERRY

Really?  

ELAINE

Yeah, they don't know.  

KRAMER

All right, I'll see you later.  

JERRY

Okay.  

KRAMER

(while eating a banana) Hey Georgie. 

GEORGE

'To the victor goes the spoils.' What are you going to do tonight?  

JERRY

Oh I got a date with Laura the lineswoman.  

GEORGE

Oh. (he stands there)  

JERRY

Why? (George fiddles with the lock on the door.) Well what are you doing?  

GEORGE

Well I was just going to wander the streets. Don't wanna tag along with you or anything.  

JERRY

Oh, uh, do you want to come with us?  

GEORGE

Jerry please, that's very nice, but, uh, (closes the door) where would we be going?  

GEORGE

So, I've got ice cream all over my face. There were no napkins there. Whoever it was that's responsible for stocking that concession stand cost me a relationship.  

LAURA

They never have napkins there.  

JERRY

Let's get the check. (Waves in the air) Is this uh considered signing? Do you do this when you want the check?  

LAURA

(does the same thing Jerry is doing) Yea. 

JERRY

Really. I know a sign, that's my first sign.  

LAURA

Uh, oh. That couple is breaking up.  

GEORGE

They're breaking up? How do you know?  

JERRY

She reads lips.  

GEORGE

What are they saying now?  

LAURA

'It's not you, it's me.'  

GEORGE

(Holding his drink up to his mouth) Oh my gosh, I just had a great idea. She could come to the party tomorrow and read Gwen's lips for me.  

JERRY

(Puts his hand over his mouth) What?  

GEORGE

(Puts nuts into his mouth, and in the process covers his mouth) We bring her to the party, and she can tell me what Gwen is saying about me.  

JERRY

(Holds his drink up to his mouth) She's not a novelty act, George. Where you hire her out for weddings and bar mitzvas.  

GEORGE

(Puts his hands on his face, rubbing his eyes) Look. It's a skill, just like juggling. She probably enjoys showing it off.  

JERRY

(Puts his napkin over his mouth) I don't know George. I'm not sure about this.  

GEORGE

(Puts his arms in the air, stretching, and covers his mouth with an arm) Could you ask her, just ask her. If she says no, case closed.  

JERRY

(Puts his hand on his chin over his mouth) All right.  

JERRY

Uh Laura, George was wondering if...  

LAURA

Sure. I'll do it.  

JERRY

So I really had a good time.  

LAURA

Yeah, me too.  

JERRY

So you want to go to the party on Friday night?  

LAURA

Yeah.  

JERRY

All right, we're taking a car service. So we'll swing by and pick you up. How about six? (Laura looks offended). Six is good. (Laura looks offended and angry). You got a problem with six? (Laura opens the door and gets out). What? What?  

MAN

Okay listen up people. There are plenty of you here, but we've only got two spots to fill. Good luck.  

BOY

(to Kramer) Hey pops, isn't there a better way to spend your twilight years?  

KRAMER

I may be old, but I'm spry.  

BOY

The tryout lasts three and a half to four hours. Are you up for it?  

KRAMER

Oh I'll be up for it punk.  

JERRY

See I was saying 'six' but she thought I was saying 'sex'. We straightened the whole thing out though.  

GEORGE

She confused 'six' with 'sex'?  

JERRY

Yeah.  

GEORGE

Well if she can't tell 'six' from 'sex' then how is she going to lip read from across the room?  

JERRY

Well 'six' and 'sex' are close.  

GEORGE

It's two completely different sounds. 'ih' and 'eh'.  

JERRY

Eh.  

GEORGE

It seems like a problem.  

JERRY

Well I'm not dating any other deaf women.  

KRAMER

Hey guess who's going to be the new ball man for the finals.  

JERRY

You're kidding.  

KRAMER

Yeah. They said they haven't seen anybody go after balls with such gusto.  

GEORGE

Oh, when is that car service coming?  

JERRY

In five minutes. He's then going to pick us up, then we're going to pick up Elaine, and Laura is going to meet us there.  

GEORGE

If this lip reading thing works tonight do you know how incredible this is going to be? It's like having Superman for your friend.  

JERRY

I know. It's like X-ray vision.  

GEORGE

If we could just harness this power and use it for our own personal gain, there'd be no stopping us.  

NEWMAN

Hey, hey, hey. (to Jerry) I hear you've got some lip reader working for you. You gotta let me use her for one day. Just one day.  

JERRY

Can't do it Newman.  

NEWMAN

But Jerry, we've got this new supervisor down at the post office. He's working behind this glass. I know they're talking about me. They're going to transfer me, I know it. Two hours, give me two hours.  

JERRY

It's not going to happen.  

NEWMAN

(Sinister) All right, all right. All right you go ahead. You go ahead and keep it secret. But you remember this. When you control the mail, you control... information.  

JERRY

Uh just pull over right there by the stop sign.  

DRIVER

(The same driver as before) Pardon me sir?  

JERRY

I said pull over by the stop sign.  

DRIVER

I'm so sorry, you'll have to forgive me. I can't hear a damn thing. I went to that rock concert last night at the garden. My seats were right up agains the speaker. It's a heavy metal group. Metalla-something.  

KRAMER

-ca.  

DRIVER

Huh?  

GEORGE

What?  

JERRY

ca.  

GEORGE

ah.  

DRIVER

My ears are still ringing. Some woman's idea of a joke.  

DRIVER

Get out. Get out. Go on. Hey. Shut the door.  

JERRY

You know the whole idea of taking the car service was so I wouldn't have to fight the traffic on Friday night.  

JERRY

I know. I'm late. Hey now I know two signs, (puts his hand in the air) check, and (points to his watch) late. Hey this is the guy you helped become the first ball man.  

LAURA

Congratulations. 

KRAMER

She doesn't know what she's talking about.  

TODD

Guys you made it.  

GEORGE

Hey hey. 

TODD

(to George) Hey buddy. 

JERRY

Hey Todd. 

TODD

Sorry to hear about Gwen.  

GEORGE

Why? Did she say something to you about why she broke up with me?  

TODD

Oh no. Tonight will be the first chance I've had to talk to her.  

GEORGE

Really? 

TODD

Look George, I'm friends with both of you. But I can't betray her confidence by telling you anything.  

GEORGE

I wouldn't hear of it, Todd. It's none of my business. But you should try to find out everything you possibly can. In fact, I'll even stay all the way on the other side of the room just so there's no chance of me overhearing anything.  

TODD

You are so centered.  

GEORGE

Hey, grown-up. (they both chuckle, George notices Gwen enter the room) Oh my god, there she is. Go ahead, go ahead. (to the others) Let's go, let's go. All right what are they saying?  

KRAMER

'Hi Gwen, hi tide.'  

JERRY

Hi tide?  

KRAMER

Hi Todd.  

KRAMER

'You've got something between your teeth'  

GEORGE

Wheret?  

KRAMER

No that's what he said. 'That's interesting. I love carrots, but I hate carrot soup. And I hate peas, but I love pea soup.' So do I.  

ELAINE

She's so wild. Can I borrow her for a few hours tomorrow afternoon?  

JERRY

No. If I lend her to you I'll have to lend her to everybody.  

GWEN

I don't envy you Todd. The place is going to be a mess.  

TODD

Well maybe you can stick around after everybody leaves and we can sweep together.  

KRAMER

'Why don't you stick around and we can sleep together.'  

GEORGE

What?  

KRAMER

'You want me to sleep with you?'  

TODD

I don't want to sweep alone.  

KRAMER

He says 'I don't want to sleep alone.' She says, oh boy, 'love to.'  

GEORGE

Alright that's it. (George walks across the room over to them.) So you get rid of me and now the two of you are going to sleep together?  

GWEN

What? You're crazy.  

KRAMER

'What? You're crazy.'  

GEORGE

I heard your whole conversation.  

GWEN

How?  

KRAMER

'How?'  

GEORGE

(looks back to the group) I can read lips. You said let's sleep together.  

GWEN

No I didn't. I said 'sweep'. Let's sweep together, you know with a broom. Cleaning up.  

KRAMER

'... with a broom, cleaning up.'  

GEORGE

Sweep?  

GWEN

Yes sweep.  

KRAMER

'Yes sweep.'  

GEORGE

Cut it.  

KRAMER

George says 'Cut it.'  

GEORGE

Cut it.  

KRAMER

George is saying 'Cut it.'  

GEORGE

Cut it. (goes back to the group) (Yelling) Would you stop signing?  

KRAMER

What? 

GEORGE

She said 'sweep together' you idiots, not 'sleep together.'  

KRAMER

I know how to sign.  

GEORGE

Ow. My eye, my eye.  

ELAINE

It's so amazing getting to see Monica Seles playing in the finals.  

JERRY

I know and on the first tournament of her comeback.  

JERRY

Thus ends the great ball man experiment.  

DRIVER

(The same driver as before) You with the tennis center?  

LAURA

Yep.  

DRIVER

Hey how about that ball man injuring Monica Seles. Wasn't that something.  

LAURA

I'm deaf.  

DRIVER

Oh. (Very suspicious look on his face.)  

JERRY

I've always been a big fan of the little check move. You know (does the motion for the check) Check, Check. Unless the waiter isn't too shape then you gotta total it up. Sometimes they come over, 'Do you want the check?' No I wanna be pen pals, can't you see what I'm doing here? I'm trying to be cool and impress people.  

ELAINE

Hmm! 

GEORGE

Fantastic! 

JERRY

I told ya. How good is this? 

GEORGE

Good. 

JERRY

How good? 

GEORGE

Very good. 

JERRY

I know it. 

ELAINE

They put real blue berries in this. And there's real blue berries. What kind did you get? 

JERRY

Coffee. And they grind up the coffee beans, and put it in. 

ELAINE

Let me test-taste that. (tastes Jerry's yogurt) 

JERRY

Huh? Huh? 

ELAINE

Hmm! Rico! 

JERRY

Suave! And it's non-fat! 

GEORGE

Ya-see, how could this not have any fat? It's too good. 

ELAINE

(offering her yogurt to George) You want to taste mine? 

GEORGE

(offers his) Oh, you want to taste mine. 

ELAINE

No, I don't. 

GEORGE

Lo..k, if you want to taste mine, you don't have to offer me some of yours. 

ELAINE

All right, let's just forget it. 

JERRY

You know, Kramer's gonna clean up on this place. 

GEORGE

What do you mean? 

JERRY

He invested in it. 

GEORGE

No kidding? 

JERRY

Yeah. We've been coming here everyday. This is so fuck(bleeped)ing good. 

MARYEDITH

Jerry! 

JERRY

Oh, I'm sorry. 

ELAINE

All right, we should get going. But, I'm going to get a little bit more, okay? 

GEORGE

Oh, god. Look who's here. 

JERRY

Who is it? 

GEORGE

This guy from my old neighborhood. Lloyd Braun. He's a big advisor to Mayor Dinkins. He thinks he's so cool. 

JERRY

Oh, oh.? 

LLOYD

Hey, George! 

GEORGE

Hey-hay! Lloyd! Hey! My friend Jerry eh. 

LLOYD

Hi. 

JERRY

Hi. 

LLOYD

So, I hear you're living back home now, is it? 

GEORGE

Yeah, there was a fire in my apartment. 

LLOYD

Fire! Whoa! There's a lot of major chicks in this place, huh? (George nudges Jerry with his right arm) Something wrong with your arm? 

GEORGE

Uh, uh, yeah. Actually, the, uh, I-I bumped my elbow on a desk and uh injured something an.. now it sort of moves involuntarily. 

LLOYD

Wow, that's a bitch, huh? So, how are your parents doing? 

GEORGE

Oh, pretty good. 

LLOYD

This place does some business, huh? 

GEORGE

Yeah, this is my first time here. (nudges Jerry again) 

LLOYD

Hey, she's a doll. (looking at Elaine) 

ELAINE

Hi! 

GEORGE

Uh, Elaine, this is, uh, Lloyd. 

ELAINE

Hi! 

LLOYD

Oh, hi! Very nice to meet you. 

ELAINE

Nice to meet you, too! 

LLOYD

Well, I'm really sorry I gotta run now. (sets down his cup of yogurt and makes his way out) Well, take it easy, huh, George? 

GEORGE

Yeah! Yeah. 

ELAINE

(excited about Lloyd) Aaah. Boy, he is really cute! 

GEORGE

He's a jerk. (nudges to his right but no one is there) 

JERRY

He's gone, George. 

GEORGE

All right. All right. 

KRAMER

So, there were a lot of people there, huh? 

JERRY

Oh, man, that yogurt place - you're going to make a fortune. 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

JERRY

They're doing an incredible business. 

KRAMER

Yeah, well, I told you to go in on it. 

JERRY

How did you know? 

KRAMER

Well, I tasted it at the one downtown. It's got a remarkable texture. You'd never know it was non-fat. 

JERRY

(answering the buzzer) Yeah? 

ELAINE

(on the buzzer) Buzz me. 

JERRY

Hey, I had the show of my life last night. I ad-libbed like ten new minutes. 

KRAMER

Yeah, but did you tape it? 

JERRY

(pulling out a tape from his pocket) Vvvvup. Right there. I got it. I did this thing on the Ottoman Empire. Like, what was this? A whole empire based on putting your feet up? 

KRAMER

Yes! 

JERRY

I'm telling you, I got like a whole new Tonight Show here. 

ELAINE

Hey! 

KRAMER

Hey! 

JERRY

What's the matter? 

ELAINE

Oh, I was having lunch, and I bit down on the fork. 

JERRY

Boy, it's hard to believe - with all that biting experience - a person could still make a mistake like that. 

KRAMER

(sort of falling backwords) Yowm! 

ELAINE

What? 

KRAMER

Well, you're getting heavy. 

ELAINE

(quietly) What? 

KRAMER

Yeah, you look like you put on (holds his hands out) five, (holds his hands wider) ten pounds. 

JERRY

Kramer! 

KRAMER

I'll tell you something else, you're looking a little chunky yourself, buddy. 

JERRY

Me? 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

JERRY

No. 

ELAINE

Where's your bathroom scale? (Jerry looks at her like 'where do you think?' Elaine and Jerry both go into the bathroom) Oh my god, I've gained seven pounds. 

JERRY

I've gained eight. 

KRAMER

I told ya. 

ELAINE

Oh, my god! A couple, but 7 pounds. How did I gain 7 pounds? 

JERRY

How did I gain eight? 

ELAINE

I don't get it. I, I've been doing the same exercises. I haven't been eating anything different. 

JERRY

Me, either. Wait a second. Wait a second. Maybe it's that yogurt. 

KRAMER

No, no, no. That's hundred percent non-fat. 

JERRY

Well, how else could this have happened? 

KRAMER

Well, maybe it's the Oreos. 

ELAINE

I don't eat Oreos. 

KRAMER

You don't eat Oreos? (acts out eating Oreos) The way you break them open? You're (does a bunch of licking motions) ~ practically having sex with them. 

JERRY

What about me? 

KRAMER

You? You're getting old. 

JERRY

Maybe your yogurt isn't so non-fat. 

KRAMER

Oh, guess again, Tubby! 

ELAINE

Jerry, there's got to be a way to find that out. 

JERRY

There must be some kind of lab that would do that kind of thing. 

ELAINE

AH! I've got it. 

KRAMER

What? 

ELAINE

I'll call the Food and Drug Administration. 

KRAMER

Hey, I'll tell you what, Chubs, if that yogurt has fat in it, I will put myself on an all-yogurt diet for a week. 

JERRY

Well, let's start the insanity. 

KRAMER

NNNN-Giddy-up! 

FRANK

Tommy Tune is a very good dancer. (hits George on the head with what seems to be the tvguide) You ever see Tommy Tune dance? 

GEORGE

No. 

ESTELLE

I like tap dancing. 

FRANK

Tap dancing. Anyone can tap dance. It's all in those shoes. 

ESTELLE

Are you kidding? They practice for years, those people. 

GEORGE

What's for supper? 

ESTELLE

Somebody's at the door. 

FRANK

Tommy Tune is very tall. That helps. It makes him lankier. 

ESTELLE

(answers the door) Lloyd? 

LLOYD

Hello, Mrs. Costanza. 

ESTELLE

Georgie, Lloyd Braun is here. 

FRANK

Hey! Lloyd! 

ESTELLE

What are you doing here? 

LLOYD

Well, I was just in the neighborhood visiting my mother so I thought I'd drop by and say, 'Hello'. 

ESTELLE

Georgie. Come here and say hello. 

FRANK

How are you doing, Lloyd? I hear you're a big advisor for Dinkins now. 

LLOYD

That's right. Hey, George. 

GEORGE

Hey, Lloyd. (Shakes hands with Lloyd) How's it going? (chuckles) 

LLOYD

I uh ran into George yesterday in the city. 

ESTELLE

Ow! (hits George on the forehead) What's the matter with you? 

LLOYD

So, uh, how's the arm, huh? 

GEORGE

Oh, it's good. 

ESTELLE

What's the matter with your arm? 

GEORGE

Nothing. 

LLOYD

Oh, his arm moves like this. (does the nudging motion) 

FRANK

Your arm moves like this? (does the nudging motion) 

GEORGE

Yeah. 

FRANK

(continues to move his arm) I never seen your arm move like this. 

ESTELLE

Me, either. 

GEORGE

Well, it comes and goes. 

FRANK

It's like some kind of aaaaa (snapping his fingers) spasm. 

LLOYD

Ooh! I asked Mr. Dinkins if he knew any good orthopedists, and he said he had the best. (hands George the Doctor's card) So, I made an appointment for you. Dr. Dekter. 

ESTELLE

Mayor Dinkins got an appointment for him? 

FRANK

You mentioned George's name to Mayor Dinkins? You discussed George with the mayor of New York? 

ESTELLE

Dinkins was talking about you. He was discussing you. 

GEORGE

You know, Lloyd, I-I've been to the doctor (hands George the card) there's really nothing they can do. 

FRANK

(grabbing the card) Hey, Mayor Dinkins set this up for you. You know what kind of a doctor this must be if Dinkins knows him? 

GEORGE

All right. All right! I'll go. 

LLOYD

Well, that's great. (grabs the card back from Frank and hands it to George again) And, uh, I'll be very interested to hear the diagnosis. 

ELAINE

Uh-huh. Okay, well, we're coming down. All right. (hangs up the phone) Okay. I got a place that can analyze it. It's in Brooklyn. We have to drive there. 

JERRY

And they said they can do it? 

ELAINE

Yeah, it's forty-five bucks. 

JERRY

All right. Let's go down to the yogurt store, and we'll get a specimen. 

ELAINE

Hm-hmm. 

MARYEDITH

Well, I hope you're satisfied. 

JERRY

What? 

MARYEDITH

Every word out of my son's mouth now is *beep*(fuck), *beep*(fuck), *beep*(fuck). (Jerry half turns and puts his head done for a second) You know what he said to me five minutes ago? Where's my *beep*(fuck)ing cupcake? 

JERRY

Gee, I'm really sorry. 

MARYEDITH

He wants to be like you because you're a comedian. Maybe you could talk to him? 

JERRY

I'd be happy to. 

MARYEDITH

Thank you. 

JERRY

Ah, Mary, we've been eating a lot of your husband's uh yogurt at the yogurt place - does that have any fat in it? 

MARYEDITH

No *beep*(fuck)ing way! 

LLOYD

Well, it was very nice seeing you again. 

ESTELLE

Oh, it was good seeing you. 

LLOYD

Oh, um, by the way, who was that gorgeous woman I saw you with the other day? 

GEORGE

Oh, uh, just a friend of mine. 

ESTELLE

You must mean Elaine. Isn't she adorable? 

LLOYD

She is. She is. How about giving me her number? 

GEORGE

Oh, you know, Lloyd, I really don't have it. 

ESTELLE

She works at Pendant Publishing. Elaine Benes. 

LLOYD

Oh, great. (nudges George on the chin) Thanks a lot! 

GEORGE

Yeah! 

LLOYD

Buh bye. 

ESTELLE

Bye! (Lloyd leaves) Oh, that Lloyd Braun. He is something, isn't he? 

NEWMAN

Well, I wouldn't hear of it. I said, 'Nice try, granny!' And I sent her to the back of the line! 

JERRY

Hello, Newman. 

NEWMAN

Hello, Jerry. Say, this yogurt is really something, huh? And it's non-fat! I've been waiting for something like this my whole life! And it's finally here! 

OWNER

Hey, Seinfeld. I'd appreciate it if you'd stop using obscenities around my son, huh? 

JERRY

It was an accident. I'm going to talk to him. 

ELAINE

I want a small, plain vanilla in a cup to go. That's non-fat, right? 

OWNER

That's right. 

ELAINE

'Cause I'm on a special diet, and the doctor said I can't have any fat. 

OWNER

Yeah, well, there is no fat. 

NEWMAN

Hey, another round of strawberry for me and my friends. 

ELAINE

Hurry, Jerry! Hurry! 

JERRY

How's it doing? 

ELAINE

Not so good. 

KRAMER

Well, you can't have this tested now. It's melting. 

JERRY

So what. 

KRAMER

It changes the molecules. 

JERRY

Oh, you don't know what you're talking about. 

KRAMER

Hey, fatso! I got a 90 in biology. 

JERRY

You call me fatso one more time; you're going to be walking back. 

ELAINE

Um, hi! Hi. I called earlier about getting the yogurt tested. 

TECHNICIAN

Oh, right. Would you fill this out, please? 

ELAINE

Uh, does it matter if it's melted? 

TECHNICIAN

No! (Jerry looks at Kramer) You know, this is going to take a couple of days. 

ELAINE

That's okay. 

KRAMER

Hello, there. 

CHERYL

Hello! 

KRAMER

Ooh! Test tubes. Cool! 

JERRY

What do you got there? 

TECHNICIAN

Actually, this is Mr. Giuliani's blood. We're doing a cholesterol work up on it. 

JERRY

Oh. 

ELAINE

Okay, I'm done. 

CHERYL

It was really nice meeting you. 

KRAMER

Well, the pleasure's all mine. 

JERRY

You can't take that chemist out. 

KRAMER

Why not? 

JERRY

Because she's like the jury. She's going to be sequestered. 

KRAMER

I'm not taking her out just to influence the results. 

JERRY

Well, I think the whole thing stinks. 

ELAINE

It smells. Smells bad. Smells really bad. 

JERRY

That's enough. 

ELAINE

What? 

JERRY

With the smelling. 

GEORGE

So, he made an appointment for me to see Dinkins' doctor. He's just trying to humiliate me. 

JERRY

Uh-huh. 

GEORGE

And I have to go. If I don't go, he'll know I'm lying. 

JERRY

Well, so, what are you going to do? Sit in the doctor's office doing this? (moves his arm) He's gonna think you're a mental patient. 

GEORGE

I don't care. Look, Lloyd doesn't know what he's up against. This is nothing to me. (moving his arm) My whole life is a lie. 

ELAINE

Hey! 

GEORGE

Hey 

JERRY

Hey. 

ELAINE

So, guess who called me. 

GEORGE

Oh, don't tell me. Lloyd? 

ELAINE

We're going out tomorrow night. 

GEORGE

Oh, look, he's going to ask you about my arm. So, just tell him I banged it against a desk. And it's been moving involuntarily ever since. 

ELAINE

I can't say that. 

GEORGE

Why not? 

ELAINE

What if I like him? I'm going to start out lying to this guy? 

GEORGE

So, you're taking his side? 

ELAINE

No. But what if we get married or something? We'll always have that between us. 

GEORGE

Already you're marrying this guy? 

ELAINE

You never know. 

GEORGE

All right, believe me, you're not going to marry him. 

ELAINE

All right, well, then what if we become a couple, George? Every time we see you you're going to be walking around going like this? (moving her arm) Even you can't keep that up. 

JERRY

No, I believe he can. 

MARYEDITH

Hi! 

JERRY

Hi! 

MARYEDITH

You know Jerry. 

MATTHEW

Of course, he's the funny *beep*(fuck). 

MARYEDITH

See! 

JERRY

Listen, Matthew, I-I want to explain something to you. Now, cursing is not something that most comedians do. 

MATTHEW

You did it. 

JERRY

That's true. But it was an accident. And I haven't done it since. And I would never do it again. And if you continue cursing, you'll never become a comedian like me when you grow up. (phone rings) Excuse me one second. 

ELAINE

You know, Lloyd advises Dinkins on everything he does. 

GEORGE

Yeah, yeah. Big advisor. 

ELAINE

He tells him which soap to use. 

JERRY

(quickly moves over toward Matthew) What the *beep*(fuck) are you doing? You little piece of *beep*(shit)! 

CHERYL

Shh! We don't want to disturb the security guard. 

KRAMER

Where's the lights. Whoa! 

CHERYL

How about this? 

KRAMER

Yeah! Bunsen burner. (runs his fingers through the flame) oo ya ya. 

CHERYL

Oo. 

KRAMER

Yaow. 

CHERYL

Ha hea. 

KRAMER

You want a taste? It's Cappuccino. 

CHERYL

It's delicious. 

KRAMER

I hear you. 

CHERYL

Non-fat? 

KRAMER

Well, you tell me. Is the verdict in yet? 

CHERYL

No. 

KRAMER

Well, this is in case there's a tie! 

ELAINE

Well, as far as I know, he bumped his arm into a door and it's kind of got this in(pauses)voluntarily movement. Some sort of a (clears her throat) spasm. So, anyway, you're a..you're a big advisor to Dinkins, huh? 

LLOYD

Yeah, yeah. It's coming right down to the wire. 

ELAINE

Wow! You know what I would do if I was running for mayor. One of my campaign themes would be that everybody should wear name tags all the time to make the city friendlier. 

LLOYD

Name tags, hmm? 

ELAINE

Well, everybody would know everybody. It would be like a small town. 

LLOYD

Maybe I'll mention that to him. 

ELAINE

Really? Wow. 

LLOYD

You sure you don't want any yogurt? 

ELAINE

No, I'm watching my weight. 

LLOYD

Well, it's non-fat. 

ELAINE

Yeah, so they say. 

LLOYD

Well I'm done, should we go? 

ELAINE

Yeah. Okay. 

ELAINE

Three days and he hasn't called me, and you know why? Because he thinks I'm too fat. 

JERRY

(surprised) He said that? 

ELAINE

(stands up straight) No, but I saw the look on his face when he put his arm around me. And then we went to his apartment, and I sat on one of his chairs and it broke. And he says, 'Boy, you're a lot of woman!' 

KRAMER

Hey! So, hear anything on the yogurt? 

JERRY

No, but I expect to hear anytime. 

KRAMER

Well, I wouldn't get your hopes up. 

JERRY

Why do you say that? 

KRAMER

No reason. Oh, did you hear about that Dinkins? 

ELAINE

No. What about him? 

KRAMER

You didn't hear? 

ELAINE

Un-huh. 

KRAMER

He's proposing a plan where everyone in the city should wear name tags. 

JERRY

Name tags? 

KRAMER

Yeah! So people can go around saying 'hello' to one another. 

JERRY

Oh, I see. So you can go, 'Hey, you know who I saw wilding today? Herb!' 

KRAMER

He's become the laughing stock! You know The Times has already stated it could cost him the election. (laughing) Name tags! 

JERRY

(on the phone) Hello? Yes. Uh-huh. Ya. Oh, really? Okay, thank you very much. Bye-bye. (hangs up the phone) Well, the yogurt verdict is in. (Kramer looks at Jerry with his arms out) Fat! 

KRAMER

Yeow! 

GEORGE

The next morning, I woke up, and it was going like this. (moves his arm slowly) I can control it if I really concentrate. But otherwise, (arm moves) oh. 

DOCTOR

Uh huh. Yes, well, I'm going to have to be perfectly honest with you. 

GEORGE

Please, doctor. 

DOCTOR

I've examined you. 

GEORGE

Yes. 

DOCTOR

I've looked at your X-rays. 

GEORGE

Uh-huh. 

DOCTOR

And I find that there's absolutely nothing wrong with you. 

GEORGE

Hmm. Really? Nothing? 

DOCTOR

Nothing, that would indicate involuntary spasms. 

GEORGE

Well, it's kind of a mystery, isn't it? 

DOCTOR

No, not really. 

GEORGE

How so? 

DOCTOR

May I suggest the possibility that you're faking? 

GEORGE

Faking? What makes you think that I have time to see doctors, take X-rays, make appointments, when there's absolutely nothing wrong with me? What kind of a person would do a thing like that? 

DOCTOR

I don't know what kind of a person would do something like that. Obviously a very sick person. A very immature person. A person who has no regard for wasting other people's valuable time. Good-bye. 

GEORGE

Now, see here, doctor. 

DOCTOR

I said, good-bye. 

GEORGE

Fine. (hits his arm on the desk) Ow! 

ELAINE

Jerry, come on, look. Let's go over to that yogurt store. 

JERRY

Look, Elaine, I've been thinking about this. This has got to be a massive conspiracy. Who knows how deep it goes. Hey, look, wait a second, (looking at the TV) Kramer, turn that up. 

KRAMER

Huh, Okay. 

NEWS

Rudy Giuliani, who underwent a physical last week, received some startling news today, when his cholesterol count turned out to be a whopping 375. What effect this will have on the minds of the voters remains to be seen. In another development, Mayor Dinkins has fired his top advisor, Lloyd Braun, who is believed to be responsible for the name tag fiasco. We now take you to Giuliani headquarters where Rudy Giuliani is about to make a statement. 

GIULIANI

It's hard to understand. Because I've been doing everything I normally do. I've been watching my diet very carefully. I exercise regularly. My only indulgence, I guess, would be that I eat a lot of frozen yogurt. But it's non-fat. 

JERRY

Non-fat yogurt? Oh, my god. They got Giuliani and he doesn't even know it. 

ELAINE

(pointing to Kramer) Now look what you've done. 

JERRY

Well, we've got to do something. (grabs his phone) I'm calling Giuliani's headquarters. 

GEORGE

Name tags! Name tags! What kind of an idiot thinks anybody would be interested in an idea like that. 

FRANK

I don't think it's so bad. People should wear name tags. Everyone would be a lot friendlier. 'Hello, Sam.' 'How are you doing, Joe?' (George's arm moves and hits the lamp) Hey, your arm. It moved again. I thought you said it went away. 

GEORGE

I banged it on the desk in the doctor's office. An (worriedly rubbing his arm) aaaa . . . 

ESTELLE

Be quiet. They're starting the press conference. 

GIULIANI

My campaign staff has received some very disturbing information regarding the fat content in yogurt that's being sold throughout the city. I pledge to you now, that if I'm elected mayor, as my first order of business I'll appoint a special task force to investigate this matter. I promise you, my fellow New Yorkers, that Mayor Giuliani will do everything possible to cleanse this city of this falsified non-fat yogurt. 

JERRY

The old yogurt was so much better. Oh, this is terrible. 

GEORGE

Phew! 

ELAINE

Oh, it stinks. 

KRAMER

Mine, too. I got one more day. 

JERRY

I can't eat this. 

NEWMAN

(from the corner of the Yogurt shop) Hey, Jerry. Thanks a lot. I hope you're happy. 

JERRY

It had fat in it, it's not good for you. 

NEWMAN

I don't care. It was good. I was enjoying it. Had to interfere. Couldn't leave well enough alone. Well, I will get even with you for this. You can count on it. 

ELAINE

Hey, you guys, listen to this. Listen to this. (reading from the newspaper) Apparently some blood spilled into Mr. Giuliani's test tube causing his cholesterol count to be 150 points higher than was initially reported. Ironically, the mishap by bringing the non-fat yogurt scandal to the attention of the public, probably clinched the election for the Republican. It was the one issue which seemed to electrify the voters and swept Giuliani into office. 

JERRY

So, in effect, the yogurt won him the election. 

ELAINE

I wonder what actually happened in that lab. 

KRAMER

Yeah, me, too. 

NEWMAN

I can't eat this. 

MATTHEW

(hits Jerry to get his attention) Thanks for ruining my daddy's business, you fat *beep*(fuck). 

TUTTLE

Well George we here at Sanalac like to think of ourselves as a fairly progressive company. We have a small but prestigious group of clients.  

GEORGE

Well a lot of people consider me small and prestigious.  

TUTTLE

That's funny George. You're very quick. I feel like I, like I don't have to explain every little thing to you. You understand everything immediately.  

GEORGE

I enjoy understanding.  

TUTTLE

I want you to have this job. Of course...  

SECRETARY

Mr. Zimmer is on line 2.  

TUTTLE

Thanks. I've got to take this call. Listen, I'm really glad that you came in.  

GEORGE

I want you to have this job. Of course...  

ELAINE

Yeah?  

GEORGE

That's it.  

JERRY

What do you mean that's it?  

GEORGE

He never finished the sentence. He got a call, that was the end of the interview.  

JERRY

'Of course' was the last thing he said?  

GEORGE

Maybe he was going to say 'Of course I have to check with my associates.'  

ELAINE

'I want you to have this job, of course the Board of Directors is under indictment and will be serving time.'  

JERRY

'I want you to have this job, of course sodomy is a prerequisite.'  

GEORGE

All right.  

ELAINE

Why don't you go ahead and call him?  

GEORGE

Because he made a big deal about how I understand everything immediately. That's what impressed him.  

JERRY

So if you call and ask if you have the job, you might lose the job.  

GEORGE

And if I don't call...  

JERRY

You might have the job, but you'll never know it. What kind of company is it?  

GEORGE

Rest stop supply.  

JERRY

Oh. 

ELAINE

Good for you. 

KRAMER

Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

GEORGE

Hey 

JERRY

Hey 

KRAMER

Hey.  

JERRY

Shower?  

KRAMER

Haircut.  

JERRY

Oh. 

KRAMER

I'm very happy with this. 

JERRY

Who'd you use? Gino?  

KRAMER

Oh course. I wouldn't let that other butcher cut my hair.  

ELAINE

What butcher?  

KRAMER

The uncle Enzo. That's the guy Jerry uses.  

JERRY

Well I've been going with him for 12 years. I can't switch. I'd hurt his feelings.  

ELAINE

You never get good haircuts.  

KRAMER

You can get a good one today. It's Enzo's day off. Gino's there all by himself.  

JERRY

Really?  

ELAINE

Yeah. You know what, you should go over there and get one to look good for my bachelor auction.  

KRAMER

What bachelor auction?  

ELAINE

Oh it's a thing where they auction off dates with bachelors for charity.  

KRAMER

And you didn't ask me to do it? I could raise enough money to cure polio.  

JERRY

I believe they've had a cure for polio for quite some time.  

KRAMER

Polio?  

ELAINE

Will you go ahead? You need a haircut.  

JERRY

Okay.  

KRAMER

What are you all dressed up for?  

GEORGE

I had a job interview.  

KRAMER

Yeah. How'd it go?  

GEORGE

Good. Of course...  

ENZO

Oh Jerry.  

JERRY

Oh hi Enzo.  

ENZO

Oh, you've come for the haircut.  

JERRY

No, actually I was just gonna...  

ENZO

It's my day off, but I take care of you anyway because you're my favorite customer. You've been with me for so long. You're so loyal.  

JERRY

Well I, if it's your day off I really... (tries to leave)  

ENZO

(He pulls Jerry into the barber chair. Jerry is trying to get away but can't.) Eh, what's the difference. It takes 10 minutes. Jerry, today I'm going to do something special for you.  

JERRY

Well I don't want to take too much off.  

ENZO

Hey who's your barber, eh? You tell the joke, I cut the hair.  

MAN

Gino, you've outdone yourself this time. This is the best haircut I've ever had.  

GEORGE

He massacred you.  

JERRY

I know. 

GEORGE

You look like you're five years old.  

JERRY

What if I shampoo? Sometimes a shampoo helps.  

GEORGE

You've got to start seeing someone else. Get out of this relationship.  

JERRY

I can't. He loves me. He says I'm his most loyal customer. Plus he's right there on the corner. I'd have to pass him every day when I go by.  

GEORGE

Well, you gotta do it.  

JERRY

I can't, I can't. I'd break his heart.  

KRAMER

No way my Gino did that. It's an Enzo.  

JERRY

He was in the shop. I thought you told me he wasn't going to be there.  

KRAMER

So what?  

JERRY

I didn't want to hurt his feelings.  

KRAMER

His feelings? You can't continue seeing him. You're destroying yourself.  

JERRY

Yea but... 

KRAMER

I'm not going to let you. If you don't call him I will.  

JERRY

No, no Kramer. I don't want you to do that. You can't do that.  

KRAMER

I'm going to call Gino, you're going to see him, and we're going to get that haircut fixed up.  

JERRY

I don't want you to call him.  

KRAMER

All right, geez. You're crazy.  

GEORGE

So I still haven't heard about that job.  

JERRY

Yeah that's a tough one. What are you going to do about that?  

GEORGE

I have an idea.  

JERRY

Yeah?  

GEORGE

I show up.  

JERRY

What do you mean you show up?  

GEORGE

I show up. I pretend I have the job. The guy's on vacation. If I have the job, it's fine. If I don't have the job, by the time he comes back, I'm ensconced.  

JERRY

Hmm. Not bad.  

GEORGE

What's the worst thing that could happen?  

JERRY

Well, you'd be embarrassed and humiliated in front of a large group of people and have to walk out in shame with your tail between your legs.  

GEORGE

Yeah, so?  

JERRY

Yeah, I see what you mean. I forgot who I was dealing with here. 

GEORGE

(to various people as he walks in) Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Hi nice to see you. How are you. Good morning. (to the secretary) Good morning.  

SECRETARY

How can I help you?  

GEORGE

The name's George Constanza. I'm starting work here today. I was wondering if you could tell me where my office is.  

SECRETARY

I wasn't aware that, uh, Mike, this is George Constanza. He's starting here today.  

MIKE

Welcome aboard.  

GEORGE

Thanks Mike. Nice to be aboard.  

MIKE

I wasn't aware that Mr. Tuttle was finished interviewing.  

GEORGE

Oh, well, he was probably just getting anxious to start his vacation.  

SECRETARY

He wants to know where his office is.  

MIKE

Oh, ah, let's see, we've got two. There's a big one down the hall there and a small one over here. You know I should ask Jack.  

GEORGE

Oh leave Jack alone. Jack's got enough problems. I'll just take the small office.  

MIKE

Really?  

GEORGE

Yes. I like to feel cozy. I have a very small apartment. I like to feel tucked in, nestled in. Love to be nestled.  

MIKE

All right, it's 808 right down there. Meanwhile, I'll get you the Pensky file, you can start working on that.  

GEORGE

Yes, yes of course. The Pensky file. Ho ho, can't wait to sink my teeth into that. Wow that Pensky. Well we'll straighten him out.  

JERRY

So what did you do there all day?  

GEORGE

They gave me the Pensky file.  

JERRY

So it's a nice place to work?  

GEORGE

You know I'm enjoying it very much. I think my coworkers are really taking to me.  

GEORGE

(continuing) I feel like a family. In fact, yesterday was Grace's birthday. She's such a sweet woman so, we had a little party, with cake and champagne. I made a toast.  

JERRY

What about your boss? The guys you interviewed you?  

GEORGE

He'll be back on Monday.  

JERRY

Hi.  

ELAINE

Hi. How come you're wearing a hat?  

JERRY

I got a haircut.  

ELAINE

Oh yeah? Can I see it?  

JERRY

Oh there's nothing to see.  

ELAINE

Come on. Let me see it.  

JERRY

Forget it.  

ELAINE

Come on.  

JERRY

All right.  

JERRY

Alright, that's very good. Thank you. 

ELAINE

(still laughing, tears in her eyes) I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.  

JERRY

Well I'll tell you this, you can forget about me going to that bachelor auction.  

ELAINE

What? No Jerry, you have to go.  

GEORGE

You know Elaine, I'd do it but I'm working that day.  

ELAINE

(dryly) Yeah, too bad.  

KRAMER

It the worst haircut Jerry's ever had. You gotta fix it.  

GINO

Sure, I fix. But you gotta make sure you no tell anybody. He's a little crazy. I don't know what he'd do if he found out I touch Jerry's hair.  

KRAMER

Yeah yeah yeah. 

GINO

(Enzo enters) So I love the Edward Scissorhands. That's the best movie I've ever seen.  

ENZO

Oh ah, again with the Edward Scissorhand. How can you have hand like a scissor, huh? Show me one person who's got hand like a scissor.  

GINO

Hey, it's a beautiful dream. I'd love to be this man.  

ENZO

Did you ever think about what you're going to do on the toilet? (yelling) What are you going to do on the toilet?  

KRAMER

I'd like to have shoehorn hands.  

KRAMER

Hey. 

JERRY

Hey 

KRAMER

Okay listen to me. I talked to Gino, he's going to fix the haircut.  

ELAINE

Oh great, then you can go to the bachelor auction.  

JERRY

Yeah, but how am I...  

KRAMER

No buts. His apartment tonight, Eight o'clock.  

ELAINE

Can he fix it?  

KRAMER

I don't know.  

GINO

Boy, you've got a beautiful head of hair.  

JERRY

Oh. thank you.  

GINO

I bet uncle Enzo, he tell you that all the time.  

JERRY

Well actually Enzo hasn't said that to me in a while.  

GINO

I don't think Uncle Enzo realize what a lucky barber he is.  

JERRY

That's nice of you to say.  

GINO

Just a second. (answering buzzer) Yes.  

ENZO

(over the speaker) It's your uncle Enzo.  

GINO

It's Uncle Enzo. Go in there. I'll clean up.  

GINO

Uncle Enzo, what are you doing here?  

ENZO

I've come to apologize.  

GINO

Apologize?  

ENZO

Yea. I rented the move Edward Scissorhands. That Johnny Depp, he make me cry.  

GINO

He make me cry too. You want something to drink?  

ENZO

Hey, what's all of this?  

GINO

Nothing. It's just hair.  

ENZO

You do haircut in the apartment?  

GINO

No. Pizza man was here. Maybe some fall off. He's going bald.  

ENZO

It looks very familiar.  

JERRY

In the one minute he worked on me I could tell he was really good.  

KRAMER

Yeah. Slow, gentle, attentive. 

JERRY

Yeah. 

KRAMER

I told you he could do it.  

JERRY

Enzo picked up one of my hairs off the floor.  

KRAMER

Yeah, so?  

JERRY

I think he knew.  

KRAMER

No. He doesn't know.  

JERRY

Who do you know? He knows my hair.  

KRAMER

Listen you're just imagining things. He doesn't know a thing. Now come on. Pull yourself together.  

JERRY

Okay, okay.  

ELAINE

What happened? It looks the same.  

JERRY

He didn't get to finish it. His uncle came in. We almost got caught.  

ELAINE

Jerry, the auction is in a few hours.  

JERRY

Take the K-man.  

ELAINE

You can still go.  

KRAMER

What are you kidding? Look at him. He's grotesque.  

ELAINE

You think?  

KRAMER

Do I think? He's repugnant.  

ELAINE

What would you wear?  

KRAMER

Whatever it takes.  

ENZO

See, now Newman is a good customer.  

NEWMAN

Once I find a barber I stick with him. I almost went to barber school. I always felt I had a talent for it.  

ENZO

Oh, not everybody like Newman, so loyal.  

NEWMAN

Yeah, just the way that I was raised. I'm special.  

ENZO

You know I don't mind if somebody's funny, but I no like the funny business.  

GINO

I'm going to go out for a little bit. I'll be right back.  

ENZO

Take your time. (Gino leaves) You happy with the haircut?  

NEWMAN

It's okay. A little crooked.  

ENZO

How'd you like to have free haircut for six months.  

NEWMAN

What's the catch?  

ENZO

You're going to get me a sample of Jerry's hair.  

NEWMAN

Hmm, that job sounds like it might be worth a year's free haircuts. And a comb.  

SECRETARY

(over the speaker) Mr. Costanza, Mr. Pensky is here to see you.  

GEORGE

Mr. Pensky? Of the Pensky file?  

PENSKY

Costanza? Arthur Pensky.  

GEORGE

Mr. Pensky. I was just working on your file. I was transferring the contents of the file into this flexible accordion-style folder. 

PENSKY

Where's Tuttle?  

GEORGE

He's on vacation.  

PENSKY

He was on vacation the last time I dropped by. Give me my file. (looks through the file) Looks like you put a lot of work into this.  

GEORGE

Well you know in college they used to call me the little bulldog.  

PENSKY

Hey, you are Pensky material. Would you ever consider coming to work directly for me?  

GEORGE

Really?  

PENSKY

You are aware...  

SECRETARY

(over the speaker) Mr. Castanza?  

GEORGE

Not now Florice.  

SECRETARY

(speaker) I thought Mr. Pensky should know they're towing his car.  

PENSKY

Damn this city.  

GEORGE

I am aware. I am aware.  

GINO

He knows. He knows about us.  

JERRY

How do you know?  

GINO

Because I know. He's crazy. All morning, he looking at the hair. He staring at the hair.  

JERRY

Who is it?  

NEWMAN

It's Newman.  

GINO

He was in the shop with Enzo. He can't see me here.  

JERRY

All right, go in the bedroom. Open the window. You can go out the fire escape.  

JERRY

What do you want?  

NEWMAN

(dancing) Can I use your bathroom?  

JERRY

What's wrong with yours?  

NEWMAN

My toilet's clogged.  

JERRY

You can't unclog it?  

NEWMAN

No.  

JERRY

Did you ask Kramer?  

NEWMAN

He's out.  

JERRY

Number one?  

NEWMAN

Yes, yes. May I go? Cause I gotta go very badly.  

JERRY

All right. Flush twice.  

NEWMAN

(thinking to himself; checks a comb) No. (checks a brush) Jackpot. I don't believe this. There's no hair in this thing. I've never seen a person that didn't have at least one hair in a brush.  

JERRY

All right?  

NEWMAN

Yeah, yeah.  

JERRY

All right, I'll see you later.  

NEWMAN

What are you doing?  

JERRY

I'm watching Edward Scissorhands.  

NEWMAN

Oh, can I watch a little? Cuz it's my favorite movie.  

JERRY

Yeah all right.  

JERRY

You want something to drink?  

NEWMAN

No. No. 

JERRY

If you want to watch, sit down. You're making me nervous. I tell you this Scissorhands is a hell of a barber.  

NEWMAN

Gotta go. Oh gee, I dropped a nickel (reaches down and picks up the hair.)  

ENZO

Did you get it? (comparing the hairs) Oh you done good Newman.  

NEWMAN

It was a cinch. Where are you going?  

ENZO

Io volgio vandetta.  

ELAINE

Nine hundred. Do I hear a thousand? Ladies, he is a Harvard graduate.  

WOMAN

A thousand.  

ELAINE

A thousand. Okay, a thousand once, a thousand twice, a thousand three times, sold to the lucky lady in the third row. Congratulations, thank you so much.  

ELAINE

Okay next bachelor is number, um 124 on your program. He's uh, he's a high school graduate.  

KRAMER

Equivalency.  

ELAINE

Oh, uh equivalency. A high school equivalency program graduate. (Kramer dances up and down the stage) He's uh, self-employed. He's... I don't know, six foot three, 190 pounds, he likes, uh... fruit, and he just got uh, a haircut.  

ELAINE

Oh, Kramer. Okay uh, why don't we start the bidding. Do I hear, um, five bucks?  

JERRY

I don't get this Scissorhands. What, is he supposed to be like a super hero, like Green Lantern or somebody? What's with this guy? (Gino looks at him annoyed) Just asking.  

JERRY

Who is it?  

ENZO

(yelling) Enzo Manginero.  

JERRY

Oh my god, he knows. (Jerry and Gino scrambling) Go. (yelling to the door) One second.  

ENZO

It was you that was in Gino's apartment the other night.  

JERRY

No I wasn't there. (enters and slams the door)  

ENZO

Don't lie. I know it was you. I get a sample of your hair. I match them up.  

JERRY

Sample? (under his breath) Newman. Uh, I was there but I was just dropping off a book.  

GINO

Don't Jerry.  

ENZO

So, it's true.  

GINO

Yes it's true.  

ENZO

I'm going to kill the both of you.  

GEORGE

Mr. Tuttle, you're back.  

TUTTLE

George, I'm surprised to see you here.  

GEORGE

You are?  

TUTTLE

I thought you would have taken the large office.  

GEORGE

Oh. Really.  

TUTTLE

I guess I didn't make that clear when I hired you. So where's that Pensky file? Let's see what you've been up to all week. 

GEORGE

Ah, here it is. 

TUTTLE

 (pages through the file) What have you been doing all week?  

GEORGE

Well you missed a lovely little party that we had for Grace.  

TUTTLE

You haven't done anything with this.  

GEORGE

Well bear in mind that I am in the smaller office.  

TUTTLE

I'm beginning to wonder if you understand anything.  

GEORGE

You are aware that Pensky is interested in me.  

TUTTLE

(scoffs) You're not Pensky material.  

GEORGE

(chuckles) Really? Well, we'll just see about that. Ta-ta, Tut-tle.  

PENSKY

Gee George, I'm sorry I gave you the wrong impression. What is was going to say was, now you are aware that our Board of Directors has been indicted, myself included, and we're prohibited from doing business until the investigation is completed. So obviously, we would have no use for you.  

GEORGE

Obviously.  

PENSKY

Yes.  

SECRETARY

(over the speaker) Excuse me, but Mr. Costanza's car is being towed.  

KRAMER

(on the phone in Jerry's apartment) So when are you gonna be able to go out? 

NEWMAN

(on the phone in his apartment with a Bald head) Not for a while. 

JERRY

No eight years isn't such a long streak.  

ELAINE

It isn't?  

JERRY

No I haven't vomited in thirteen years.  

ELAINE

Get out!  

JERRY

Not since June 29, 1980.  

ELAINE

You remember the date?  

JERRY

Yes, because my previous vomit was also June 29th... 1972. That's why during the '80 vomit, I was yelling to George: 'Can you believe it? I'm vomiting on June 29th again.'  

ELAINE

Boy, you know when Joel told me he hadn't thrown up in eight years, I was wondering if he was normal.  

JERRY

No Elaine he's normal. Your boyfriend is a normal guy. He just happens to have the same name as one of the worst serial killers in the history of New-York.  

ELAINE

Yeah... (2 co-workers enter Elaine's office) Oh Jer, I gotta go. I gotta go. (she hangs up)  

JOANNE

Hi, we just saw your boyfriend at a bus stop.  

ELAINE

Oh, yeah?  

JOANNE

Yeah. What's his name?  

ELAINE

Joel...  

JOANNE

Joel what?  

ELAINE

Uh... (clears her throat) Rifkin.  

MICHAEL

Rifkin? Joel Rifkin?  

ELAINE

Yeah. It's just a coincidence obviously.  

MICHAEL

Guess you better keep on his good side.  

ELAINE

Very funny. That's very funny.  

JOANNE

I wouldn't sleep with my back to him if I were you.  

ELAINE

All right. Well that's enough of that. That's enough.  

MICHAEL

Hey Elaine listen. If you smell anything decaying in the trunk of his car...  

ELAINE

(she's upset, gets up and yells) OK look this is my boyfriend we're talking about OK? And he's a gentlemen, he's good looking, he's a good shaver and he hasn't thrown up in eigth years so just shut up about him! Shut up!  

ELAINE

The whole city is talking about this monster Joel Rifkin, and I am dating a Joel Rifkin.  

JERRY

But you like your Joel Rifkin.  

ELAINE

Yeah. I just wish he has a different name.  

JERRY

Ask him to change it.  

ELAINE

You can't ask a person to change their name.  

JERRY

Why not?  

ELAINE

Would you change yours?  

JERRY

If someone asked me nicely. I'm Claude Seinfeld.  

ELAINE

Hey, how many people did Rifkin strangle? Eighteen?  

JERRY

Yeah. Eighteen strangles.  

KRAMER

You know why Rifkin was a serial killer? Because he was adopted. (saying it as he's taking a lot of paper towels from Jerry's roll; Elaine and Jerry are confused at Kramer's statement) Just like Son of Sam was adopted. So apparently adoption leads to serial killing. (Kramer leaves and we don't know why he needed so much paper towels)  

ELAINE

You know Joel and I have an extra ticket to the Giants game.  

KRAMER

I'll go.  

ELAINE

O.K. I'll leave the ticket for you at will call.  

KRAMER

Yeah! Ooh! (leaves again)  

ELAINE

You think I should have asked George?  

JERRY

Hey did you hear that George got back with Karen?  

ELAINE

Karen?  

JERRY

Risotto. (we see a flashback from The Mango where Karen tells George that she feels full after a Risotto, as opposed to when she has sex with him)  

ELAINE

Oh! The Risotto broad.  

JERRY

Yeah. He's really got a good thing with her. In fact I'm doubling with them tonight.  

ELAINE

I tought you didn't like double dates.  

JERRY

George likes them, he feels it's a good personality showcase. He likes a date to see him with a friend so she can get a window into his nondate personality.  

ELAINE

I've looked through that window and screamed at him to shut the blinds.  

JERRY

He feels he's funnier, more relaxed.  

ELAINE

And you're taking...  

JERRY

Jody the masseuse.  

ELAINE

Hey, did you get a massage yet?  

JERRY

No! How many times do I have to go out with her before I get a massage?  

ELAINE

Jerry, she gives massages all day. She doesn't wanna to give them on dates.  

JERRY

Yeah I know... She just wants to have sex.  

ELAINE

So what?  

JERRY

So it's like going to Idhao and eating carrots. I like carrots, but I'm in Idhao, I want a potato.  

GEORGE

(George is telling a story. Karen is laughing and she seems to be the only one to find him funny) So I go into this clothing store and the saleswoman is wearing this (whistling) low cut thing. So I said to her: 'Can I ask you a question? When you put on a top like that, what's your tought process? What's going on in your mind?'  

KAREN

That is so funny.  

GEORGE

(to Jody) You're listening to this?  

JODI

Yeah. I heard you.  

JERRY

(to Jody) My neck is killing me. Right in this spot. Very tender over here.  

JODI

(to George) So what did she say?  

GEORGE

Well nothing. I didn't actually say that. (Karen is still laughing)  

JODI

You just said that you said it.  

GEORGE

Sweetheart, I was exaggerating.  

KAREN

I'm learning a lot about you tonight George. I've never seen you like this.  

JERRY

(touching the back of his neck) It's like somebody's pulling on wires back here.  

GEORGE

You know it's like you never see a really attractive woman getting a traffic ticket.  

JODI

How can you say that? My sister got a ticket last week. Are you saying she's not attractive?  

GEORGE

Well I've never met your sister but obviously these are not hard-and-fast rules. (to the waitress) Darling, the tea is getting a little cold sweetheart.  

JODI

(to Jerry) Can we go?  

JERRY

Yeah. Let's go.  

KAREN

So soon? (they get up)  

JERRY

Yeah. Good seeing you again Karen.  

KAREN

Yeah.  

JODI

Nice meeting you Karen.  

KAREN

Yeah. Nice to meet you too and I'm gonna call you about that massage.  

JODI

Oh yeah.  

GEORGE

Jody let's do this agian real soon (he tends his arms for a hug but she avoids him)  

JODI

Yeah. (she and Jerry walk away)  

JERRY

I strained my neck last night.  

JODI

Really, how?  

JERRY

I tried brushing my teeth by holding the brush and moving my head from side to side. It didn't work.  

JODI

So what's the deal with your friend George?  

JERRY

No deal. Why?  

JODI

What was all that 'attractive women not getting tickets' nonsense?  

JERRY

Oh well, he was just showcasing his nondate pesonality.  

JODI

I don't know how you can hang out with that guy.  

JERRY

Yeah. Sometimes he really makes me tense (he takes Jody's hand and put it on his shoulder)  

JODI

Did you see the way that he was eating?  

JERRY

Yeah, he's disgusting. (putting her hand back on his shoulder. She unconsciously starts to massage a little while watching TV)  

JODI

I have to tell you, I really don't like him.  

JERRY

Yeah, me either. (he takes her other hand and put it on his other shoulder)  

JODI

It's just I hate that type.  

JERRY

Yeah, he's a bad seed.  

JODI

Now you however, you, I like. (she stops massaging and kisses Jerry)  

JERRY

What are you doing?  

JODI

What do you think I'm doing? (he won't get his massage...)  

GEORGE

So, what do you think?  

KAREN

Really enjoyed it.  

GEORGE

Jody's nice.  

KAREN

She's very nice. (grabs George's hand) Let's discuss this later.  

GEORGE

You think she liked me? She seemed to like me.  

KAREN

Yeah  

GEORGE

I was personable. Don't you think I was personable?  

KAREN

You were extremely personable.  

GEORGE

I tought I picked up a little something. I'm very good at this. Did you pick up anything?  

KAREN

I didn't pick up anything.  

GEORGE

The second time I sent the noodles back, I tought she made a face...  

KAREN

I didn't see a face.  

GEORGE

I tought I saw a face.  

KAREN

Anyhow, what is the difference?  

GEORGE

No difference. I could care less. She's Jerry's girlfriend.  

KAREN

George, George, instead of talking about this, we could be... you know... (she makes a move with her head like George did in 'The Mango' while saying: 'instead of the movie...')  

GEORGE

He he he he  

KAREN

Ah ah ah ah  

GEORGE

So you think she likes me?  

ELAINE

(as he touches her) Uhh! What are you doing?  

JOEL

Massaging your neck.  

ELAINE

Oh. Huh. Of course. Massaging.  

JOEL

Uh, boning up on football? (talking about the magazine she's reading as he sits beside her)  

ELAINE

Yeah, yeah. You know what? There are a lot of players named Deon these days. What a cool name, Deon. If I were gonna change my name, I'd go with Deon.  

JOEL

Deon Benes?  

ELAINE

Well as a woman, it makes no sense. But, I mean, let's say I was you. And I decided I was gonna change my name for no real reasons whatsoever-- Deon Rifkin. Wow! That is so cool.  

JOEL

D-Deon Rifkin?  

ELAINE

Well maybe you're not the Dion type. O.K. then let's see, let's see, what do we got? (looking at the magazine, she starts to gasp and loses it) Oh! Oh oh oh! O.J.! O.J. Rifkin! You don't even use a name, it's just initials. Oh please please please change your name to O.J.! Please, it would be so great!  

JOEL

Elaine! What is going on?  

GEORGE

She stayed over?  

JERRY

Yeah. (disappointed)  

GEORGE

The sex wasn't so good?  

JERRY

No. The sex was fabulous.  

GEORGE

So?  

JERRY

I want the massage!  

GEORGE

Did you ask her?  

JERRY

I tried putting her hands there (on his neck) but she pulls it away immediately, she's not into it.  

GEORGE

Why not?  

JERRY

I guess 'cause it's her job. It's very frustrating.  

GEORGE

So we had a good time... the four of us.  

JERRY

Yeah.  

GEORGE

We all got along. Everyone seemed very pleasant.  

JERRY

Yeah.  

GEORGE

What did Jodi say?  

JERRY

She had a good time.  

GEORGE

Is that it?  

JERRY

Pretty much.  

GEORGE

Did she say anything about, uh...  

JERRY

What?  

GEORGE

Nah. It's all right. Great! She had a good time.  

JERRY

Yeah (a so-so yeah as he takes a sip of coffee)  

GEORGE

You just hesitated.  

JERRY

I was blowing on the coffee.  

GEORGE

She didn't like me?  

JERRY

Look it's not like you're gonna be spending a lot of time with her.  

GEORGE

So she doesn't like me?  

JERRY

No.  

GEORGE

She said that?  

JERRY

Yes.  

GEORGE

She told you she doesn't like me!  

JERRY

Yes.  

GEORGE

What were her exact--  

JERRY

'I don't like him.'  

GEORGE

Uh-Huh (gulp) Why didn't she like me?  

JERRY

Not everybody likes everybody!  

GEORGE

I tried to be nice. I wasn't nice?  

JERRY

You were very nice!  

GEORGE

I bent over backwards for that woman! Is it that thing I said about her sister?  

JERRY

It has nothing to do with her sister.  

GEORGE

I don't even know her sister but believe me, if she's getting traffic tickets, she's not that good-looking! Woah 

GEORGE

You vomited in 1987.  

JERRY

Oh no. That was the dry heaves.  

JERRY

Jodi.  

JODI

Hey, Jerry.  

GEORGE

Ha! Ha! Hey! (moving his arms like: it's so great to be all here)  

JERRY

What are you doing here?  

JODI

I was giving Kramer a massage.  

JERRY

Kramer! (tries to hide he's upset and jealous)  

JODI

I got to run. I have an appointment downtown.  

GEORGE

Here. Let me take your tabe downstairs for you.  

JODI

No that's O.K.  

GEORGE

Please give it to me. I love to help people. This is what I do. Come on. I'm going this way. (he takes the table from Jodi's hands and she has no choice but to follow him)  

JERRY

I'll see you tonight. (he's opening his door apartment as Kramer comes out of his in a bathrobe)  

KRAMER

Hey! I am looser than creamed corn!  

JERRY

Who told you to get a massage from her. I haven't gotten a massage from her yet!  

KRAMER

You don't know what you're missing buddy.  

GEORGE

No one hails a cab like me. My hailing technique is unmatched. I get the wrist going from side to side and boom! Cabs are crashing into themselves to just pick me up. (a cab stops) All right, here we go. Let me get door. Feminists aside, I know women like the door holding. Here we are all righty. O.K. Jodi let's get together again real soon and say hello to your sister for me.  

JODI

You've never met. (the cab starts and George is following to keep talking to Jodi)  

GEORGE

Whatever. Believe me, if I wasn't involved right now, I wouldn't mind being set up. Something tells me she's a knockout. (we see, from the camera inside the cab, George's hand waving as the cab drives away)  

KRAMER

(Kramer is talking much more slowly and smoother than usual) First she sets the mood perfectly with this new age music played over ocean sounds. Then she lays you out on this table, and she proceeds to rub oil over your entire body. And she rubs long... and deep... Jerry, she rubs with love. (Jerry is obviously cutting much harder than the cheese needs it as he listens to Kramer) Every muscles she touches just... (long pause) ooo-zz-es. Beneath those silky, soft fingers, you can scarcely contain yourself, buddy. (Jerry slams down the knife and goes to the couch)  

JERRY

So you had a good time.  

KRAMER

Oh... yeah...  

JERRY

Enjoyed yourself.  

KRAMER

Very... much...  

JERRY

All right now you listen and you listen good! (he grabs Kramer's legs and throws him down the couch)  

KRAMER

What! (Kramer is back to his usual way of speaking)  

JERRY

The massages are out!  

KRAMER

Wha--  

JERRY

Ahh!!! They're out!  

KRAMER

Why?!  

JERRY

Because if I can't get one, you're not getting one.  

KRAMER

Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I need my massages! Can't you see I'm burned out!  

JERRY

I'm sorry, Kramer. (he goes back to the kitchen)  

KRAMER

Why? Why? Look, I paid for her. (Jerry stops walking)  

JERRY

Don't you ever talk about her like that!  

KRAMER

But why?  

JERRY

That's final!!!  

KRAMER

Ah!!! Yahh!!!  

ANNOUNCER

Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to Giants stadium. 

ELAINE

Oh, you have photos in your wallet?  

JOEL

Yeah. Why? Is that weird?  

ELAINE

No, it's normal. You're very normal. You're totally normal. Who's this?  

JOEL

That's my mother.  

ELAINE

Oh yeah. I see the resemblance.  

JOEL

No, there's no resemblance.  

ELAINE

Yeah, there is, right here you see--  

JOEL

Elaine, I was adopted.  

ELAINE

(pause) Oh. That's nice.  

JOEL

Oh, the game's about to start. I wonder where your friend Kramer is.  

KRAMER

(to the ticket man) Uh, yeah, a ticket for Kramer.  

MAN

Here it is. I need some I.D.  

KRAMER

Oh, yeah. (snaps fingers) You know, I forgot my wallet.  

MAN

Well, I can't give it to you then.  

KRAMER

Are you kidding me?  

MAN

I'm afraid not.  

KRAMER

Come on, just look at me. Tell me I'm not Kramer.  

MAN

I'm sorry. I need proof.  

KRAMER

Look, I'll drive out here tomorrow and I'll show the I.D. I got nothing to do all day.  

MAN

Neither do I. But without I.D., I need confirmation from the person who left the ticket.  

KRAMER

Where's a phone?  

ANNOUNCER

Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention, please? Would Joel Rifkin report to the stadium office. Joel Rifkin...telephone. (the crowd stops cheering and we see a football player, Lawrence Taylor of the N.Y. Giants, distracted from the game while hearing the announcer saying Joel Rifkin)  

JOEL

Who would be calling me here? (he stands up and look around)  

ELAINE

(to the person in front of her) He's not the murderer.  

KRAMER

Oh, God.  

JERRY

What's the matter with you?  

KRAMER

Jerry, I need another massage!  

JERRY

You just had one yesterday. What do you need another one for?  

KRAMER

Because of the Giant game! I told you, It went overtime! You know what those seats are like. They're very unforgiving.  

JERRY

Oh please.  

KRAMER

And then the game-winning field goal went over the net and into the crowd and I dove over three rows! My back, it's killing me! (whining) It's killing me Jerry!  

JERRY

Well, did you get the ball?  

KRAMER

Oh I got the ball.  

JERRY

Well, I never even caught a foul ball at a baseball game.  

KRAMER

Well, It's quite a thrill.  

JERRY

Why don't you get somebody else?  

KRAMER

Because nobody does it like she does. She's the best.  

JERRY

Well, that's it! Tonight's the night. I'm getting one. No 'if and's or but's'.  

KRAMER

What about my massage?  

JERRY

(whining like Kramer) Ask Newman.  

GEORGE

So I lugged that table. That big heavy massage table all the way down to the cab! You ever seen one of those things?  

KAREN

Of course.  

GEORGE

No, I don't know. Maybe you haven't. You know, not everybody's seen a massage table.  

KAREN

What, do you think I've never had a massage before?  

GEORGE

Anyway, I don't even get a thank you. I don't get it!  

KAREN

George, frankly, I'm getting a little tired of hearing about her.  

GEORGE

I wanna know what I did to this woman.  

KAREN

What, you got a little thing for her?  

GEORGE

No, No! She's going out with a friend of mine. It's only courteous that we should try and like each other.  

KAREN

What difference does it make? Who cares if she doesn't like you? Does everybody in the world have to like you?  

GEORGE

Yes! Yes! Everybody has to like me. I must be liked!  

ELAINE

Of course I support your decision to change your name.  

JOEL

After the Giant game I realized that this--this problem isn't going away.  

ELAINE

Well, listen, I just want you to know that I was more than willing to stick it out with Joel Rifkin.  

JOEL

Sure?  

ELAINE

(she fakes a strangling) RRR...  

JOEL

O.K. you got your list?  

ELAINE

Yeah. Yeah. 10 names.  

JOEL

Right.  

ELAINE

O.K. And if somebody objects, you can just veto it.  

JOEL

O.K.  

ELAINE

O.K. You start. What's your first choice?  

JOEL

Stuart.  

ELAINE

(right away) No. Second choice.  

JOEL

Stu--Stuart's no good?  

ELAINE

I have never met a normal guy named Stuart.  

JOEL

O-O.K. My second choice is... Todd.  

ELAINE

(repeating to hear how it sounds) Todd. (pause) No. Veto.  

JOEL

All right. Oh, hey, I think you're gonna like my first my third choice.  

ELAINE

Great...  

JOEL

Alex.  

ELAINE

I gotta tell ya, I have a bad association with the name Alex.  

JOEL

Bad bad association?  

ELAINE

Yeah, in college I sat next to an Alex in art history. And he was always drinking coffee and after every sip he would go: 'Ahh'. I mean every two seconds: 'Ahh'. And he would take like 40 sips and after everyone: 'Ahh'. I had to drop the class.  

JODI

Hey.  

JERRY

Hi.  

JODI

Hi. (kiss) I was running late and I didn't have a chance to drop off my stuff before I came over.  

JERRY

Ah, no problem. That's fine.  

JODI

What's with this music?  

JERRY

That's new age music. Sounds of the forest. I find it soothing. Hey, look at this! What do you know? A massage table! This is great! (he starts to install the table)  

JODI

What are you doing?  

JERRY

Just checking it out. Look at how this thing is made. Can I tell you something? That's a hell of a piece of equipment.  

JODI

Actually, I should get a new one.  

JERRY

No, nonsense. This one's fine. (as he sits on the table)  

JODI

So, where do you wanna go? (as she puts her hand on his shoulder)  

JERRY

Go? Why go anywhere? (as he places his hand over hers. She starts to massage his shoulders a little) Ahh, that feels good. Yeah. That's, uh... That's good. (he tries to go further. He grabs her hands over his shoulders and he lies down on the table on his chest) Yeah, that's nice. That's very nice.  

JODI

(she stops massaging) No. No, this isn't good. I can't do this.  

JERRY

Why, what's wrong? (he grabs her hands and force her to keep them on his shoulders)  

JODI

I can't (she tries harder to pull her hands away)  

JERRY

No. Yes you can. (he hangs on)  

JODI

No, I can't!  

JERRY

Come on! I know it's something you wanna do! (she pulls harder and he falls right off the table)  

GEORGE

You know what? I should really go talk to her. Nothing confrontational. Just two adults sitting down trying to clear the air. You know, I just know if I could spend some time alone with her. I've got to. (he grabs his jacket) I've got to.  

KAREN

You're going now?  

GEORGE

I think I can still catch her.  

KAREN

All right George. I have had just about enough of this.  

GEORGE

What? What are you talking about.  

KAREN

I am talking about you and Jodi. You're completely obsessed with her!  

GEORGE

I know. I know.  

KAREN

Who is more important to you, her or me? I like you, she doesn't. Who are you gonna pick?  

GEORGE

(he thinks a little about it... and as he puts his hand on his knee and gets up) I'm sorry Karen. I know I care for you, but I just can't stand when someone doesn't like me. (he opens the door)  

KAREN

Well, now I hate you!  

GEORGE

That I'm used to. (he leaves)  

JOEL

Ned?  

ELAINE

What is wrong with Ned?  

JOEL

Ned's a guy who buys irregular underwear. Next!  

ELAINE

Ellis.  

JOEL

Ellis?! You might as well go with Alex. It's the same thing!  

ELAINE

Ellis and Alex aren't even close.  

JOEL

NEXT!  

ELAINE

Ohh, what is the point?  

JOEL

NO, NO. COME ON!  

ELAINE

O.K. O.K. Remy.  

JOEL

Remy Rifkin? Should I get a beret?  

ELAINE

Oh, Stuart's a lot better! (talking like a baby) Little Stuart Rifkin likes to go shopping with his mother.  

JOEL

Grrrr!  

JERRY

What do you mean, no?  

JODI

No means no.  

JERRY

Look, who are you kidding? You come up to my apartment with your table and your little oils, and I'm not supposed to expect anything? You're a massage teaser.  

JODI

Listen. I massage who I want, when I want. I don't submit to forcible massage. (he tries desperately to get her hands on his shoulders again but she pulls them away immediately) I'm getting out of here.  

JERRY

Fine. Go.  

GEORGE

Jerry, could you excuse us for a few minutes, please?  

JERRY

What for?  

GEORGE

We need to talk.  

JERRY

You need to talk?  

JODI

We have nothing to talk about.  

GEORGE

Look it's no secret what's going on between us. (to Jerry) She doesn't like me. Now Jerry if you don't mind.  

JERRY

George, anything you have to say to her, you can say in front of me.  

GEORGE

(he makes a sign to Jodi to wait and turns to Jerry) Jerry... This woman hates me so much. I'm starting to like her.  

JERRY

What?  

GEORGE

She just dislikes me so much... It's irresistable.  

JERRY

I can see that.  

JODI

I'm getting out of here. (to Jerry) Don't call me.  

JERRY

Don't worry. (she leaves)  

GEORGE

A woman that hates me this much comes along once in a lifetime.  

JERRY

You're a lucky guy.  

GEORGE

I got to go after her.  

JERRY

George. I wouldn't push for the massage. (George nods)  

GEORGE

JODI! (he starts running after her)  

JERRY

The swedish are very big massagers. You know? They like the swedish meatballs, swedish massage. They like having meat in their hands these people, for some reason. But it's weird because they have the highest suicide rate, they're rubbing each other's necks all the time for a neutral country they seem kinda tense. I don't really like the idea of getting a professional massage. I don't want people touching me that don't know me and don't want to have sex with me. You know what are you bothering me for? You get me all loosened up, juices flowing, and then that's it ok, you're done. It's like having chocolate rubbed all over your face, you know you wanna go 'Excuse me, I think you missed a spot.'  

JERRY

How would you describe the smell in this house?  

ELAINE

(sniffing) Dandruff?  

JERRY

Yeah, that's part of it. (sniffs) Kasha?  

ELAINE

There's some kasha.  

JERRY

Yeah. Dandruff, kasha, mothballs, cheap carpeting. It's pot pourri, really.  

ELAINE

Alright, let's go, come on.  

GEORGE

Wha... you're going?  

ELAINE

Yeah. You know we shouldn't have bowled that last game, I'm gonna be late.  

KRAMER

Egh. These aren't candies.  

GEORGE

Wha? Did you use those? These are guest soaps! (he grabs the soaps and begins examining them for damage)  

KRAMER

Well I'm a guest.  

GEORGE

Now my parents are gonna know I had people over.  

JERRY

You're not allowed to have people over?  

GEORGE

I can't have any parties while they're out of town. (he leaves to return the soaps)  

KRAMER

What, this is a party?  

ELAINE

Not any more. Come on, get your ball, we're leaving. Let's go, let's go.  

GEORGE

(yells) Wow! Who put this cup right on the new table!  

JERRY

(picks it up) I was having coffee, I put it on the coffee table.  

GEORGE

But you didn't use a coaster, Jerry, you left a stain! (he runs to kitchen)  

KRAMER

Whoah boy. There's always one at every party, huh?  

ELAINE

(impatient) Come on!  

JERRY

What's the big rush?  

ELAINE

I'm having people over.  

JERRY

Who?  

ELAINE

The girls for poker night. You know, Joanne, Renee, Winona...  

JERRY

Eh, eh, ah. Winona's gonna be there?  

ELAINE

Yeah. And she broke up with the vitamin guy.  

JERRY

(interested) Really?  

ELAINE

I'll put in a good word for you.  

JERRY

Thanks, because I would really like... (distractedly puts coffee cup back on the table)  

GEORGE

(screaming) Aaahh!!  

JERRY

Alright, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. (picks it up again)  

GEORGE

But Jerry, this is not coming out!  

JERRY

Just put a coffee table book over it.  

GEORGE

My parents don't read! They're gonna wonder what a book is doing on the table!  

KRAMER

Hey, hey, hey, hey. You know what would make a great coffee table book? A coffee table book about coffee tables! Get it?  

ELAINE

Got it! C'mon, let's go, let's go. Bye George.  

GEORGE

Wait, wait wait, not so fast. Jerry, you gotta take me to get this thing refinished.  

ELAINE

Now?!  

GEORGE

Yes, now. It's gonna take a few days and my parents are gonna be back. I gotta have it back before them!  

ELAINE

Jerry, you promised you'd get me home by seven.  

KRAMER

Alright, we'll take the subway.  

JERRY

There you go. That'll get you home in time.  

ELAINE

Oh! The subway? From Queens?  

GEORGE

Alright, Jerry, I'm gonna get my coat.  

JERRY

I'm sorry Elaine, I'll make it up to you.  

ELAINE

I need something to read on the subway.  

JERRY

(handing her a magazine) Here, read this.  

ELAINE

(looks at it) TV Guide?  

KRAMER

Like a history of coffee tables, celebrities and their coffee tables. It's a natural. This is a story that must be told.  

ELAINE

(engrossed in magazine) Hmm-mmm.  

KRAMER

So, you're gonna talk to your boss about it, huh?  

ELAINE

(still paying no attention) Hmm-mmm. First thing in the morning.  

KRAMER

(claps hands) Yes indeed.  

TANNOY

Next stop, Queensboro Plaza.  

KRAMER

Oh, Queensboro Plaza. (reties his shoelaces) This stop is famous for its gyros, you want one?  

ELAINE

How are you gonna get something and get back on the train in time?  

KRAMER

Well, they got a stand right out on the platform. Gyros are cooked, and wrapped, and ready to go. (he pulls money from his pocket) Three dollars, no change. You want one?  

ELAINE

(laughing) No thanks.  

KRAMER

Alright, but no bites.  

RICKY

Highlighter?  

ELAINE

Excuse me?  

RICKY

To highlight the programmes you plan to watch.  

ELAINE

Ah. Uh, look really (looks about to try and avoid contact) I'm just trying to read.  

RICKY

Fine, okay. It's just, I've never seen a beautiful lady reading 'the Guide' so far away from a TV. You must really like television.  

KRAMER

(yells) Elaine!  

RICKY

Guess your boyfriend'll have to catch the next train.  

ELAINE

He's not my boyfriend.  

RICKY

He's not? (thoughtful) Interesting.  

JERRY

Hey, maybe I should get Elaine something.  

GEORGE

Why?  

JERRY

Ah, you know, I didn't drive her home. Plus, I give her a gift in front of Winona, how does that hurt me?  

GEORGE

Can't hurt you.  

JERRY

What about, what about this thing?  

GEORGE

The Indian?  

JERRY

Yeah. You know, kind of a peace offering. Cute.  

GEPETTO

Well, I can have the table ready for you on Monday.  

GEORGE

Alright, but no later, because my parents are coming back.  

GEPETTO

They left you home alone, huh?  

RICKY

Oh, 'kay, see. On this particular Tuesday (he swaps seats and sits beside Elaine) you could've watched six hours of Lucy. There's I Love Lucy, The Lucy Show, Here's Lucy.  

ELAINE

Oh, (nervous laugh) my stop. (making her escape) Bye-bye.  

RICKY

(after Elaine) Hey miss! (waving TV Guide) You forgot this!  

GEPETTO

They don't make these any more. The work is, is all done by hand. (Sylvia enters the store behind him) Takes years, and years, and... (notices) Sylvia! For crying out, you're forty-five minutes late!  

SYLVIA

Yeah, yeah. (to George, smiling) Is that your car out there?  

GEORGE

No, it's, it's his. (indicates Jerry)  

SYLVIA

Oh, nice. You guys are obviously from Manhattan.  

GEORGE

Well, he is. I, uh, I live around the corner.  

SYLVIA

Really? Ah, I didn't think any cool guys lived in this neighborhood.  

GEORGE

(sensing his chance) Well, they do now. Neighborhood's changing.  

JERRY

Alright, I'll take it.  

GEPETTO

Smart choice.  

SYLVIA

Wow, you bought the Indian? Oh, you guys have great taste.  

GEORGE

Well, we're collectors. We, uh, see objects of great beauty and, uh, we must have them.  

ELAINE

Knocked you out Jack. Pair of deuces  

GIRLS

(disappointed) Oh/Aah. 

ELAINE

(triumphant) Ha, ha, ha ha!  

ELAINE

Who is it?  

JERRY

It's Jerry.  

ELAINE

Jerry!  

JERRY

Surprise! (he carries in the object)  

ELAINE

What is this?  

JERRY

Well, I felt bad about this afternoon, so I got you something.  

ELAINE

Oh, you did? (to girls) Oh, do you guys all know Jerry?  

GIRLS

Hi Jerry/Hello. (etc)  

JERRY

Hi. Hi Winona. Nice to see you again.  

GIRL

Elaine, is it your birthday?  

ELAINE

No.  

JERRY

I don't need a reason to give gifts, it's my nature. I love to make people happy.  

GIRLS

Aww/That's so sweet. (general murmur of approval)  

JERRY

Are you ready?  

ELAINE

Yeah.  

JERRY

(whips off bag to reveal Indian) Ta-da!  

JERRY

It's a cigar store Indian. (to Elaine) Read the card.  

ELAINE

(examines card; embarrassed) That's very nice. Thank you very much.  

JERRY

Read it out loud.  

ELAINE

I, I don't think so.  

JERRY

(takes the card from Elaine) We had a little fight this afternoon. (reading from card) Let's bury the hatchet. We smoke um peace pipe.  

WINONA

(gathering her stuff) Hey, you know, it's late. I really should go.  

ELAINE

I, uh, I don't blame you Winona. I, uh...  

JERRY

Hey-yah, ho-ah, hey-yah, ho-ah.  

ELAINE

Are you out of your mind?!  

JERRY

...ho-ah. It's, it's, it's kitschy.  

ELAINE

Winona is a Native American.  

JERRY

She is?  

SYLVIA

You got very unusual taste.  

GEORGE

(proffering glasses) I hope prune juice is alright. It's the only thing I had that was chilled.  

SYLVIA

Fine.  

GEORGE

I'm sorry about that lock on the liquor cabinet. The combination musta just flown outta my head. It's a mental block.  

SYLVIA

(regarding photo) Ahh! Is this your son in the bubble bath?  

GEORGE

(bashful) No, that's me.  

SYLVIA

Oh. You don't see many guys your age who keep baby pictures of themselves around. (laughs) I like it. Consistent with the rest of the house.  

GEORGE

Yes, it is consistent. I've, uh, I've tried to maintain a consistent feel throughout the house.  

SYLVIA

What is this we're listening to?  

GEORGE

The Ray Conniff Singers. (nervous chuckle)  

SYLVIA

Mmmm, what's that smell? Kasha?  

GEORGE

It's a pot pourri. May I, uh, may I show you the master bedroom? (they leave together)  

WINONA

Who is it?  

JERRY

Uh, Winona, it's Jerry Seinfeld.  

WINONA

(unimpressed) Yeah?  

JERRY

Uhm, listen, I really felt bad about what happened, and I, I, I'd really like to apologise. Can I come up?  

WINONA

I'll come down.  

KRAMER

I came by to get my ball.  

ELAINE

It's right over there.  

KRAMER

Oh, yeah, thanks. (gets ball) Yeah, it's got the magic grip. How d'you think I bowled that two-twenty today, huh? (sees Indian) Yo! Where did this come from?  

ELAINE

You want it?  

KRAMER

(unbelieving) I can have this?!  

ELAINE

Yuh! You wanna lug it uptown, it's yours.  

KRAMER

Oh. I'll lug.  

WINONA

It's just that it's a very sensitive issue for me.  

JERRY

And well it should be. I think if you spent any time with me at all, you'd see I'm very sensitive to these matters as well. You wouldn't be hungry by any chance, wouldya?  

WINONA

(smiling) I guess I could go for a bite.  

JERRY

You like Chinese food, 'cos I once went to a great Szechwan restaurant in this neighbourhood. I don't remember the exact address... (he spots a mailman crouched emptying a box) Uh, excuse me, you must know where the Chinese restaurant is around here.  

MAILMAN

Why must I know? Because I'm Chinese? You think I know where all the Chinese restaurants are? (adopts hackneyed Chinese accent) Oh, ask honorable Chinaman for location of restaurant.  

JERRY

I asked because you were the mailman, you would know the neighbourhood.  

MAILMAN

Oh, hello American Joe. Which way to hamburger, hotdog stand? (storms away)  

JERRY

I didn't know that...  

WINONA

You know, it's late. I should probably just go home.  

JERRY

I, I had no idea.  

KRAMER

(yells) Hey Jerry! (thumps cab door with his palm) Look what I got! (begins doing war-whoops)  

GEORGE

Looks pretty good.  

JERRY

Yeah, did a good job.  

GEORGE

Yeah. I don't think they'll be able to tell.  

JERRY

You know, I don't get it. Not allowed to ask a Chinese person where the Chinese restaurant is! I mean, aren't we all getting a little too sensitive? I mean, someone asks me which way is Israel, I don't fly off the handle.  

GEORGE

So, anyway, what's uh, what's the status with, uh...  

JERRY

Ah, she kinda calmed down. I talked to her today. In fact I'm gonna see her tonight.  

GEORGE

Oh, great.  

JERRY

Yeah, but I'm a little uncomfortable. I'm afraid of making another mistake.  

GEORGE

Aw c'mon.  

ESTELLE

Hello, hello!  

GEORGE

(insincerely) Ahh, hey you're home. Hi.  

ESTELLE

Oh, the house looks very nice.  

GEORGE

Yeah, huh.  

FRANK

Where's the mail?  

ESTELLE

Hello Jerry.  

JERRY

Hello.  

GEORGE

So, how was the trip?  

ESTELLE

Ah, your father...  

FRANK

Is there anything wrong with getting a receipt at a toll booth?  

ESTELLE

I'm going upstairs. (she leaves for the bedroom)  

FRANK

(examining mail) This stack should be bigger, where's the TV Guide?  

GEORGE

What TV Guide?  

FRANK

I'm missing TV Guide volume forty-one, number thirty-one.  

JERRY

Uh, Elaine took it to read on the subway.  

FRANK

Elaine took it?  

GEORGE

I didn't know she took it!  

JERRY

Wa, it's two weeks old.  

FRANK

(shouting) How could you let her take the TV Guide?!  

GEORGE

(to Jerry) He collects them.  

JERRY

You collect TV Guide?  

FRANK

The nerve of that woman. Walking into my house, stealing my collectible!  

ESTELLE

(screaming) Oh my God! (she enters holding a small packet) This was in our bed.  

FRANK

(taking the packet) What is this? (accusingly to George) A prophylactic wrapper?!  

ESTELLE

What is this doing on my bed?!  

GEORGE

I don't know, uh...  

JERRY

I'll see you later. (he leaves with unseemly haste)  

FRANK

You were having sex on our bed?!  

GEORGE

Yes!  

ESTELLE

Who told you, you could have sex in our bed?  

GEORGE

(pleading) Well, my bed is too small.  

FRANK

Your bed is too small? I'm gone two weeks and you turn our house into, into Bourbon Street!  

ESTELLE

Where am I going to sleep?  

GEORGE

What are you talking about?  

ESTELLE

I can't sleep in there!  

GEORGE

Of course you can.  

ESTELLE

I can't! (screams) I can't!  

FRANK

That's it! You're grounded!  

GEORGE

(incredulous) You can't ground me, I'm a grown man.  

FRANK

You wanna live here? You respect the rules of our house. (yells) You're grounded!  

WINONA

So, where are we gonna go eat?  

JERRY

I thought we'd eat at the Gentle Harvest.  

WINONA

Ooh, I love that place, but it's usually so crowded. Can we get a table?  

JERRY

Ah, don't worry. I made reser... (catches himself)  

WINONA

You made what?  

JERRY

I uh, I uh, I arranged for the appropriate accommodations. And then, Knick tickets, floor seats.  

WINONA

How did you get these?  

JERRY

Got 'em on the street, from a scal... (catches himself again)  

WINONA

From who? 

JERRY

A uh, one of those guys.  

WINONA

What guys?  

JERRY

You know, the guys, that uh, they sell the tickets for the sold-out events.  

WINONA

Oh.  

JERRY

Wait a second, you got the Mark McEwan TV Guide.  

WINONA

That's Al Roker.  

JERRY

Oh well, they're both chubby weathermen. I get Dom Deluise and Paul Prudhoe mixed up too. Could I have this?  

WINONA

Sure, take it.  

JERRY

Thanks.  

JERRY

So, Winona had the TV Guide. Told you I'd make it up to you.  

ELAINE

Aah, so Mr Costanza was pretty mad, huh?  

JERRY

Yeah. You almost ruined his life's work.  

ELAINE

He collects (holds up magazine) these?  

JERRY

Yeah.  

ELAINE

Wow! Alright, well I will personally go out to Queens and deliver his Al Roker TV Guide to him.  

JERRY

What'ya do with the one you took?  

ELAINE

I dunno.  

ELAINE

Hi.  

KRAMER

Yeah uh, Elaine uh, what'd he say?  

ELAINE

What did who say?  

KRAMER

Your boss. Didn't you tell him about the coffee table book?  

ELAINE

Uhmm...  

KRAMER

Yeah, you didn't tell him didya?  

ELAINE

Kramer, it is such a dumb idea. I would be (raising her voice as Kramer speaks his line) totally embarrassed to bring it...  

KRAMER

(simultaneous) Wait a minute, on the cover I'm...  

ELAINE

I would be embarrassed to bring it up.  

JERRY

I thought it was a pretty good idea. It's about coffee tables, it's on a coffee table.  

KRAMER

Yeah, right, right, and on the cover is a built-in coaster. (clicks tongue) Alright, well I'm gonna go.  

JERRY

Where you going?  

KRAMER

Well, I'm gonna go to the cigar stores. I'm gonna see if I can sell that Indian.  

JERRY

My Indian?  

KRAMER

You know, I think it's worth something. It's kitschy. (tongue click)  

FRANK

How do you just walk into a house and take a TV Guide? How does she expect you to watch TV? (doorbell rings) Am I just supposed to turn it on and wander aimlessly around the dial?  

RICKY

Hello. Is Elaine home?  

ESTELLE

Elaine Benes? Oh, she's my son's friend.  

FRANK

(shouting) And she's not welcome in this house!  

RICKY

(entering) Oh, 'cos I made her this very special gift. 'Kay, it's a bouquet of paper from her TV Guide.  

FRANK

(yelling) That's my TV Guide! Ripped to shreds! She gave that to you?!  

RICKY

(seeing TV) Hey, is that the Twilight Zone you're watching?  

GEORGE

Yeah.  

RICKY

Oh, this is a good one.  

TANNOY

Next stop, Queensboro Plaza.  

ELAINE

Mmm, gyro.  

WINONA

I like your place. It's very unassuming.  

JERRY

Well, why would I assume. I never assume. Leads to assumptions.  

WINONA

(laughs) Oh, by the way. That TV Guide I gave you, I need it back.  

JERRY

Why?  

WINONA

Well, I'm doing a report on minorities in the media, and I wanted to use that interview with Al Roker.  

JERRY

Well, it's too late. I gave it to Elaine, and she's already on her way to give it to George's father.  

WINONA

Jerry, I really need it back. It, it is mine.  

JERRY

You can't give something and then take it back. I mean, what are you... (catches himself)  

WINONA

What?  

JERRY

A uh, a person that uh...  

WINONA

A person that what?  

JERRY

Well, a person that gives something and then they're dissatisfied and they wish they had, had never uh...  

WINONA

And?  

JERRY

...give, given it to the person that they originally gave it to.  

WINONA

You mean like, an Indian giver?!  

JERRY

I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with that term.  

RICKY

I like the special fall preview issues the best.  

FRANK

Those. I've been saving those from the beginning.  

RICKY

These are worth like, a lot of money.  

ESTELLE

Oh, hello Elaine!  

ELAINE

Hello. (she enters)  

RICKY

(jumping to his feet) Elaine! Hello! You look scrumptious.  

FRANK

Why'd you take my TV Guide?  

ELAINE

(placatory) I'm so sorry about that Mr Costanza, but look. Look, I brought you another one. (hands it over)  

RICKY

I made this for you.  

ELAINE

(accepts reluctantly) Oh, thank you.  

FRANK

(examining magazine) What is this? You got stains all over it! What the hell'd you do?  

RICKY

Hey, you can't talk to her like that.  

FRANK

(yelling) I'll talk to her any way I want!  

RICKY

Come on Elaine, let's go.  

ESTELLE

My coffee table!  

KRAMER

I don't understand. How can you have a cigar store, without an Indian? It's unseemly.  

SPIKE

I'll give you a box of Coronas for it.  

KRAMER

Forget it.  

LIPPMAN

Uh, excuse me. Are you uh, selling this Indian?  

KRAMER

Oh yeah, yeah.  

LIPPMAN

Uh, I'm just uh, redecorating my office in a south-western motif and this'd be perfect. Give you five hundred dollars for it?  

KRAMER

Giddyup.  

LIPPMAN

Yeah? Could you help me bring it up to my office, I'm right next door. Pendant Publishing.  

KRAMER

Pendant Publishing? Giddyup again.  

ELAINE

Mr Lippman. I'm sorry, I was in Queens uh... (sees Kramer) Kramer!  

KRAMER

Yeah, hi Elaine.  

ELAINE

What are you doing in here with that?  

KRAMER

Ah, well, it's a business transaction.  

LIPPMAN

(entering, smoking a cigar and with a handful of cash) Listen uh, petty cash just had tens and twenties. (hands cash to Kramer) Go ahead, count it.  

KRAMER

Yeah, I'm sure it's all here. (puts in in his pocket) You know I was just admiring your coffee table, out there in the hall.  

LIPPMAN

You like that, huh? I had that custom made for me in Santa Fe.  

KRAMER

You mind if I use it in my book?  

LIPPMAN

What book?  

KRAMER

Well, I'm doing a coffee table book on coffee tables.  

LIPPMAN

About coffee tables?  

KRAMER

Uh huh.  

LIPPMAN

That's fantastic. (Elaine looks gobsmacked) Who's your publisher?  

KRAMER

Well, I'm still shopping it around.  

LIPPMAN

Yeah? (to Elaine) You see, this is the kind of idea you should be coming in with. What the hell do you do round here all day anyway?  

ELAINE

Well I (indistinct) ...manuscript that I...  

LIPPMAN

(ignoring Elaine) God, that Indian really completes the room. Don't you think?  

SYLVIA

I know this coffee table, it's George Costanza's.  

ESTELLE

It's mine. I'm his mother.  

SYLVIA

Oh, I haven't seen George for a while. He must be working very hard.  

ESTELLE

George doesn't work. He's a bum. That's why he lives at home with us.  

SYLVIA

He does?  

JERRY

I don't know why we didn't think of this before. We just could call TV Guide.  

ELAINE

I dunno.  

JERRY

Well, it's gonna make Mr Costanza very happy. (he hands the magazine to Elaine)  

ELAINE

I guess.  

JERRY

What's the matter?  

ELAINE

What d'you think is the matter? I've been assigned to work on Kramer's coffee table book.  

JERRY

It is a good idea, Elaine.  

TANNOY

Next stop, Queensboro Plaza.  

JERRY

You want a gyro?  

ELAINE

I don't think so.  

JERRY

Elaine!  

ROKER

Guess your boyfriend's gonna have to catch the next train.  

ELAINE

He's not my boyfriend.  

ROKER

He's not? Interesting. (gives a big grin)  

JERRY

I was always excited as a kid, when that new TV Guide would come. Somehow when that front cover's nice and flat, seems like there's good fresh TV shows in. Then, as the weeks go by you start to hate the TV Guide. All the shows stink. Everything's getting all crumpled and ripped from being sat on, thrown across the room. TV Guide is always thrown, never handed, to another person. It's the world's most thrown reading material. 'Where's TV Guide?' (mimes throwing) 'There it is.' You know in the back of the TV Guide, they have a phone number, ninety-five cents a minute, they will give you the answers to the TV Guide crossword puzzle? My question is, if you can't do the TV Guide crossword puzzle, where are you coming across ninety-five cents?  

GEORGE

Can I say one word to you? Lobster. The lobster here is unbelievable. (looks at the menu) Ooh, a little expensive.  

SASHA

Twenty five dollars.  

GEORGE

Yes, well, you know, I'm not thinking about the price. You know you're the only woman I've never thought about the price. Get the lobster. I beg you to get the lobster. Go for the lobster.  

SASHA

George, George, uh, I think we have to talk. I think we have a problem.  

GEORGE

We do?  

SASHA

We can't keep seeing each other.  

GEORGE

Why?  

SASHA

(crying) Because it's over. (sob, sob, sob) It's my parents George, the differences in our religion. Oh George, can you ever forgive me? (sob)  

SASHA

(crying) Yes. I'll have the lobster.  

GEORGE

Um, you know I'm starting to think that maybe lobster isn't the way to go.  

JERRY

Then he asked you out?  

ELAINE

We started to talk, and I told him that I jog, and then he put his hand on my heart.  

JERRY

On your heart?  

ELAINE

Jerry, the man is a doctor.  

JERRY

Doctor? He's a podiatrist.  

ELAINE

So, it's the same thing.  

JERRY

Anyone can get into podiatry school. George got into podiatry school.  

ELAINE

Really?  

TAWNI

Hello.  

JERRY

Oh hi.  

TAWNI

Are you going to be stopping by later?  

JERRY

Yes, I'll be stopping.  

TAWNI

Ok, see you later. 

JERRY

See you later. (to Elaine) Well we can't all be dating podiatrists. (Elaine laughs) 

GEORGE

It's over.  

ELAINE

What?  

JERRY

How did you get in?  

GEORGE

Kramer.  

ELAINE

What's that? (points at some foil on the table) 

GEORGE

Lobster.  

JERRY

Looks like a swan.  

GEORGE

She says we can't go out anymore.  

ELAINE

Why?  

GEORGE

Because I'm not Latvian Orthodox. Her parents won't let her get involved with anyone who isn't Latvian Orthodox.  

ELAINE

Latvian Orthodox? (gasps) Mmm, it is lobster.  

JERRY

She's limiting herself to Latvian Orthodox? Too bad.  

GEORGE

I know. This was the only woman I never lied to. Well that's not entirely true.  

JERRY

Oh, whatever. 

ELAINE

Mmm, this is delicious.  

JERRY

Mmm, succulent.  

GEORGE

She knew I didn't have a job, she knew I lived at home. Didn't seem to bother her. I think I could have married this woman.  

ELAINE

Why don't you just ask her parents?  

GEORGE

I can't. I met them. They're devout. You know, in the cab on the way over here, I actually thought about converting.  

JERRY

To Latvian Orthodox?  

GEORGE

Why not? What do I care?  

JERRY

You know it's not like changing toothpaste.  

ELAINE

I think it would be romantic.  

GEORGE

Really?  

ELAINE

Yeah, it's like Edward the Eighth abdicating the throne and marrying Mrs. Simpson. Ooh.  

GEORGE

King Edward. (snapping his fingers) King Edward, Jerry.  

JERRY

Yeah well King Edward didn't live in Queens with Frank and Estelle Costanza.  

GEORGE

You know what? I could probably do this. What's the difference.  

ELAINE

George I was just kidding around.  

GEORGE

No. I wouldn't even have to tell her. I could surprise her.  

ELAINE

George I wasn't serious.  

GEORGE

How hard could it be? You make a little contribution, you have a ceremony. I am going to think about this. I am really going to think about this.  

ELAINE

I guess this one is my fault.  

JERRY

Oh yeah.  

TAWNI

(kiss, kiss, kiss) Oh that was nice. Have you always been such a good kisser?  

JERRY

Oh I don't know. Not always. No I uh I had to work at it. When I was a kid all the kids would be out playing, I would be up in my room practicing my kissing.  

TAWNI

Well it was worth it. (kiss) I'll be (kiss) right (kiss) back (kiss). Where are you going?  

JERRY

To wash my hands. They're sticky from the orange.  

TAWNI

Meet you back here?  

JERRY

Right there.  

JERRY

(thinking to himself; picks up a tube) 'Fungicide'. Fungus?  

JERRY

Fungicide. I mean what could she have?  

ELAINE

I don't know.  

KRAMER

Fungus.  

JERRY

Exactly 

ELAINE

So what did you say?  

JERRY

I said I was coming down with the flu or something and I had to go home.  

ELAINE

I don't know, what were you doing opening her medicine cabinet?  

JERRY

I didn't open it. It was open. I just nudged it a little.  

ELAINE

You were snooping.  

JERRY

I was not snooping. I did not break the seal. There was no breaking and entering. I wouldn't do that.  

KRAMER

I would. I always open medicine cabinets.  

ELAINE

Well I trust people not to do that.  

KRAMER

Big mistake.  

JERRY

Why don't you ask that doctor what it is?  

ELAINE

What? Now he's a doctor? Before he was a podiatrist.  

JERRY

But that's what podiatrists do. They deal in fungus. They're knee- deep in fungus. This guy knows fungus.  

ELAINE

I am not going to ask him about funguses.  

KRAMER

Fungi.  

JERRY

What?  

KRAMER

Fungi.  

PRIEST

Why do you want to accept the Latvian Orthodox faith?  

GEORGE

(ahem) In this age of uncertainty and confusion, a man begins to ask himself certain questions. How can one even begin to put into words something so um... (trying to think of a word)  

PRIEST

Enigmatic?  

GEORGE

No.  

PRIEST

Vast? (he pronounces it as 'vost')  

GEORGE

No not vast (he pronounces it as 'vost')  

PRIEST

Well whatever it is, basically you like the religion.  

GEORGE

Yes.  

GEORGE

(he thinks) I think the hats. The hat conveys that solemn religious look you want in a faith. Very pious.  

PRIEST

Are you familiar with Orthodox theology?  

GEORGE

Well perhaps, not to the extent that you are. But I know the basic plot. Yeah.  

PRIEST

Plot?  

GEORGE

Yes. You know the uh flood, and the uh lepers, and the commandments and all that.  

GEORGE

Oh yes I am Father. Incredibly sincere. So, uh, pffft, am I in?  

PRIEST

The first step would be to familiarize yourself with these texts (brings out a pile of books).  

GEORGE

Ah hah. You see Father, I'm I'm incredibly anxious to become a member. Um, don't you offer any kind of an express conversion? A quick change?  

ROBERTA

Oh I'm sorry. Father, there's a man waiting in the chapel.  

PRIEST

You may attend to it Sister, oh this is George Costanza. He is interested in joining the church.  

ROBERTA

Oh are you? That's wonderful. Well good luck to you.  

GEORGE

Nice nun.  

PRIEST

No, Sister Roberta is not a nun. She is what we call a novice.  

ROBERTA

May I help you?  

KRAMER

Oh yeah, I'm here to pick up my friend George Costanza.  

ROBERTA

Well he's in with the Father.  

KRAMER

Oh yeah.  

ROBERTA

I'm Sister Roberta.  

KRAMER

Oh. Kramer. Pleasure.  

ROBERTA

Mine. (she smiles at Kramer)  

GEORGE

I can't believe how easy it is. I'm virtually Orthodox. All I have to do is read a few books, memorize a few prayers, and I'm in the club.  

JERRY

That's all there is to it.  

GEORGE

That's all there is to it. By Christmas day I will be Brother Costanza.  

JERRY

And when is Brother Costanza planning on telling Mother Costanza?  

GEORGE

Brother Costanza will be taking the vow of silence.  

JERRY

Oh a slinky. 

KRAMER

Sister Roberta gave it to me.  

JERRY

Why did she give you that?  

KRAMER

I think she liked me.  

JERRY

What do you mean she liked you?  

KRAMER

Liked me.  

GEORGE

Kramer, they like everybody. They're friendly people.  

KRAMER

No. I think I picked up on a vibe.  

JERRY

You picked up on a vibe, from a nun.  

KRAMER

Yeah, Jerry I'm telling you I have this power. And I have no control over it.  

JERRY

Yea alright.  

KRAMER

Oh, that's my phone. 

JERRY

Oh hi.  

TAWNI

Hi, I just wanted to stop by and see how you were feeling.  

JERRY

(weakly) A little better. (fake cough)  

TAWNI

If you need anything let me know.  

JERRY

Okay. 

TAWNI

Okay. 

JERRY

All right. 

TAWNI

Bye. 

JERRY

Bye. 

GEORGE

Story.  

JERRY

She's subletting Carol's place for a month.  

GEORGE

Yea, she likes you.  

JERRY

Yeah but there's a problem. I found a tube of a fungicide in her medicine cabinet.  

GEORGE

So?  

JERRY

So I don't know what she's using it for.  

GEORGE

Well how do you even know it's hers? Maybe it belonged to Carol. Did you see a name on the tube?  

JERRY

I didn't even think to look.  

GEORGE

Well take a look. It might not even belong to her.  

JERRY

Yeah.  

GEORGE

People always leave old things in their medicine cabinet.  

JERRY

Yeah I've got this old bottle of cough medicine.  

GEORGE

I still have brill cream.  

JERRY

Hi 

TAWNI

Hi.  

JERRY

Hi. Can I use your bathroom?  

ELAINE

You sure you don't mind?  

DOCTOR

No of course not. People ask me medical questions all the time.  

ELAINE

Well I mean the question isn't even for me it's for a friend.  

DOCTOR

Elaine, I'm used to it. I'm a doctor.  

ELAINE

Well... podiatrist.  

DOCTOR

Huh?  

ELAINE

No no, I'm just saying you didn't really go to medical school, you went to podiatry school. Which I'm sure is very grueling in it's own way.  

DOCTOR

I went to podiatry school because I like feet. I chose to work with feet.  

ELAINE

I like feet too. I'm just saying...  

DOCTOR

Saying what?  

TAWNI

How are you doing in there?  

JERRY

Fine all done, just looking for the soap.  

TAWNI

No soap?  

JERRY

No I don't see it.  

TAWNI

(giving Jerry the soap) Here you go.  

ESTELLE

George what are you doing in there?  

GEORGE

What? Nothing.  

FRANK

You've been in there an hour.  

ESTELLE

You don't feel well?  

GEORGE

I'm fine.  

ESTELLE

I want to know what you're doing in there.  

GEORGE

Nothing.  

FRANK

George, open the door.  

GEORGE

No.  

ESTELLE

Georgie.  

GEORGE

No!  

KRAMER

Hey.  

ROBERTA

Good evening. I hope I'm not disturbing you, but I found another toy I thought you might like.  

JERRY

Okay, Latvius was the son of which apostle? And I'll need that in the form of a question.  

GEORGE

I don't know. I can't believe they're making me take this test.  

JERRY

Hey, did you talk to the doctor?  

ELAINE

No.  

JERRY

All right, the next time you see him show him this. (He presents the bottle of fungicide.)  

ELAINE

You took her medicine.  

JERRY

Not on purpose. I was hoping there would be a name on the tube. When are you seeing him again?  

ELAINE

I don't know. We got into this whole thing about how podiatrists aren't real doctors.  

JERRY

How could you say that?  

ELAINE

It's you fault. You just got me thinking.  

JERRY

I was merely speaking extemporaneously.  

ELAINE

I've got nothing against the foot. I'm pro-foot.  

JERRY

Me too.  

ELAINE

Do you think I should call him and apologize?  

JERRY

Yes. He's a doctor. (Elaine starts to leave. ) Wait a second. (Jerry puts the bottle of fungicide in Elaine's purse.) (to George) What are you doing?  

GEORGE

What does it look like I'm doing?  

JERRY

(Reading words George wrote on his hand) 'Matthew, Luke, Paul', what you're cheating on your conversion chest?  

KRAMER

I told you.  

JERRY

What?  

KRAMER

I told you she liked me.  

JERRY

Who?  

KRAMER

Sister Roberta.  

JERRY

How do you know?  

KRAMER

She told me. She said she's never had a man stir up all of these feelings inside of her. She's questioning her faith. She's thinking of leaving the church.  

JERRY

Wow 

KRAMER

Oh, uh, this power. I'm dangerous Jerry, I'm very very dangerous.  

PRIEST

I must say George, I was somewhat surprised at the results of your conversion test. I don't recall having seen such an impressive performance. You truly must be filled with the spirit of the Lord.  

GEORGE

Oh, I'm I'm full of it Father.  

PRIEST

Yes, yes I see. (To George) I'm sorry something has come up.  

GEORGE

Oh, I understand. (George exits; Sees Kramer in the hallway) Hey. 

KRAMER

(rushed) Yea, Hey. (Kramer enters.) Um, you wanted to see me Father?  

PRIEST

Yes. Please, sit down. Sister Roberta came to see me yesterday.  

KRAMER

I know what this is about Father. I didn't do anything. I just spoke to her innocently for just a few minutes. It's just that, that I have this power.  

PRIEST

Yes. Kavorka.  

KRAMER

Kavorka?  

PRIEST

It is a Latvian word which means 'the lure of the animal'.  

KRAMER

I don't understand.  

PRIEST

Women are drawn to you. They would give anything to be possessed by you.  

KRAMER

Help me Father. Help me.  

PRIEST

Yes, yes I will help you. Listen very carefully. I want you to buy ten cloves of garlic, three quarts of vinegar, six ounces...  

JERRY

What is that stench? I got it. (He follows the smell to Kramer's door) Ah hah.  

KRAMER

Hey.  

JERRY

Hey. What are you doing?  

KRAMER

I've got the Kavorka Jerry.  

JERRY

The Kavorka? What's that?  

KRAMER

The lure of the animal. I'm dangerous.  

JERRY

What is this thing around your neck?  

KRAMER

The priests they're helping me. I just bathed in vinegar.  

JERRY

You know you're funcifying the whole building.  

KRAMER

Keep away Jerry. Keep away.  

JERRY

Kramer. (knock, knock, knock) Kramer.  

WOMAN

George Costanza? Estelle's son?  

ESTELLE

Latvian Orthodox? Why are you doing this?  

GEORGE

For a woman.  

FRANK

A woman? What are you out of your mind?  

ESTELLE

Why can't you do anything like a normal person?  

FRANK

Wait. Is this the group that goes around mutilating squirrels?  

GEORGE

No it's a regular religion.  

FRANK

I'm calling my lawyer. It might not be too late to get out of this.  

GEORGE

I don't want to get out of it.  

ESTELLE

Bu George, you don't know what you're saying. You're under their control.  

FRANK

What, they brainwashed you?  

GEORGE

No no.  

FRANK

You're not performing any rituals in this house.  

ESTELLE

Go back to the psychiatrist. I beg you.  

FRANK

And stay away from those squirrels.  

TAWNI

Oh how you doing Jerry?  

JERRY

Good. What's the matter?  

TAWNI

I'm tired. I hardly slept last night with all this scratching. Bonkers was going crazy.  

JERRY

Bonkers?  

TAWNI

My cat. He's got this weird sort of skin condition. Some type of fungus, I couldn't find his medicine.  

JERRY

Oh it's your cat!  

TAWNI

What?  

JERRY

Ooh, nothing.  

PRIEST

Are you ready my son?  

GEORGE

Yes faddah.  

PRIEST

What did you say?  

GEORGE

What?  

PRIEST

I thought you said faddah.  

GEORGE

I said faddah, I meant Father. Just a little bit nervous.  

PRIEST

Ooh, of course. 

KRAMER

How you doing?  

WOMAN

Get away from me you creep. (She walks away.)  

KRAMER

Yes, Yes. It worked. Sister Roberta I've still got time to catch her.  

PRIEST

Congratulations George. Welcome to the faith. Sister Roberta would you please offer the final benediction.  

ROBERTA

(hesitates) I can't. (crowd murmurs) I'm sorry. It's a beautiful religion, but I am not worthy of it. I found something else.  

ROBERTA

Him.  

CROWD

Kavorka, Kavorka.  

ELAINE

(kiss, kiss) You know, because I love the foot. I'm a big fan of the foot.  

DOCTOR

Well it's my fault. I got a little defensive.  

ELAINE

And that pinkie toe, come on . How adorable is the pinkie toe.  

DOCTOR

It's my favorite toe.  

ELAINE

Let's face it, you get a bunion, where are you going? You're not going to the ear guy.  

DOCTOR

No you're not.  

ELAINE

I'll be right back.  

DOCTOR

Oh uh, where's the bathroom?  

ELAINE

It's right down here to the left. I will uh meet you right back here.  

JERRY

Elaine it's her cat. Her cat had the fungus. So I need the tube back.  

DOCTOR

(Thinking to himself) 'Fungicide'? Fungus?  

ROBERTA

Something's wrong. I don't feel the same lure.  

KRAMER

You don't?  

ROBERTA

What have I...? I must return to the church. By the way you really need to take a bath. You stink.  

KRAMER

Yeah yeah.  

JERRY

But once you put medicine in your medicine cabinet you're never using it again. Any medicine you're using, is on the sink. It's not really even a medicine cabinet, it's really like an ointment museum isn't it? It's like here's a saff from 1983, some cream from the 70s. But you want to keep it private, because a medicine cabinet is a place that reveals our weaknesses and it can really throw off the balance between two people that might be going out. Somebody peeks in there, 'Oh I see Mr. Perfect needs tough actin' Tinactin. Well I guess I'll be calling the shots in this relationship from now on.' 

SASHA

For me?  

GEORGE

Well I didn't do it for my mother.  

SASHA

I'm really flattered. But I just don't feel ready to make a commitment yet. Maybe when I get back from Latvia.  

GEORGE

Latvia?  

SASHA

Yes. I'm going to stay with some relatives there for a year. Isn't it great?  

GEORGE

Enjoy, enjoy.  

SASHA

Oh George, you are so sweet. Don't ever change.  

GEORGE

I'd like a doggie bag for this please. (hands her plate to the waitress) 

JERRY

The whale is supposed to be such an intelligent animal. You know you always here about how they can communicate by song from miles away. How extensive their vocabulary is. I would say from the rate we are pushing the whales off the beach back into the ocean the words shore and close do not appear to be in their vocabulary. I would say if the whales concentrate a little less on the singing and a little more on approaching Quervo beach volleyball tournament. If you wanna maintain the brainy mammal image. 

ELAINE

Oh, I can't believe this. What a dope! uh..excuse me umm.. I'm sorry this is.. this is kind of embarrassing but.. there's no toilet paper over here  

JANE

(from the stall on Elaine's right) Are you talking to me?  

ELAINE

yeah.. I I just forgot to check so if you could just spare me some. 

JANE

No I'm sorry  

ELAINE

What?  

JANE

No I'm sorry, I can't spare it  

ELAINE

you can't spare it??  

JANE

no there's not enough to spare  

ELAINE

well I don't need much, just 3 squares will do it  

JANE

I'm sorry I don't have a square to spare, now if you don't mind  

ELAINE

3 squares? you can't spare 3 squares??  

JANE

no I don't have a square to spare, I can't spare a square  

ELAINE

oh is it two-ply? cause it it's two-ply I'll take one ply, one ply, one puny little ply, I'll take one measly ply  

JANE

look, I don't have a square and I don't have a ply (flushing and leaving)  

ELAINE

No no, no no, don't don't, I beg you  

JERRY

(eating pop corn) hmm I love this artificial flavoring I like it better than butter I think it's more consistent  

JANE

you would not believe what just happened to me in the bathroom  

JERRY

what?  

ELAINE

hey  

TONY

Hey. Hey? where is my popcorn babe?  

ELAINE

what?  

TONY

my popcorn, you were supposed to get me popcorn what? would you forget about me babe?  

ELAINE

you would not believe what just happened to me in the bathroom  

JANE

I mean.. a person needs a certain amount of toilet paper to be covered.. I simply could not spare it this woman just didn't get it, she kept harassing me  

ELAINE

3 squares!! that's all I was asking for! 3 squares!  

JANE

she wouldn't stop 'help me! help me!' she was insane  

ELAINE

I was begging her 'please! please!' she was insane  

JERRY

who do you think she is? how dare she? you want me to get the manager? too bad they don't have those old ladies walking around with flashlights anymore we'd flush her out  

JANE

I don't know what she looks like  

JERRY

I wonder where Elaine is sitting? I really wanted you to meet her she's supposed to be here tonight with her new boyfriend Tony  

ELAINE

hmm where is Jerry sitting? he's supposed to be here tonight with his new girlfriend I'm dying to see what she looks like  

TONY

hey? you think if I jumped off that balcony I'd get hurt?  

KRAMER

hey  

JERRY

KRAMER

JERRY

KRAMER

JERRY

It's not one of those 976 calls, is it?  

KRAMER

look come on, let me use it, 5 minutes, I'll pay you back huh?  

JERRY

KRAMER

ELAINE

I am never going back to the movies again  

JERRY

ELAINE

ELAINE

ELAINE

ELAINE

JERRY

ELAINE

JERRY

well maybe she couldn't spare it  

ELAINE

a square?  

JERRY

well, you know, sometimes a square is everything  

ELAINE

a ply?  

JERRY

Elaine, you cannot judge a person on a situation like that. I mean it's like asking for someone's canteen in the desert  

ELAINE

yeah  

JERRY

it's battle conditions  

ELAINE

yeah, well I just hope I run into her again ok, cause I will never forget that flinty voice, it is tattooed in my brain if I hear it, watch out So listen what happened with Jane last night?  

JERRY

KRAMER

JERRY

(on the phone) hey Andre, get the hell off the phone!  

ELAINE

JERRY

Kramer's Andre, he's fooling around with these 976 numbers (Kramer walks out of the bedroom) hey I told you, I don't want you doing that on my phone  

KRAMER

Jerry, I'm telling you, this phone sex thing is hilarious, like this woman Erika, here look (showing the ad in the newspaper). You gotta call her, the voice she uses..  

JERRY

KRAMER

ELAINE

JERRY

Elaine, he's a.. he's a male bimbo, he's a mimbo  

ELAINE

JERRY

ELAINE

no it is not  

JERRY

ELAINE

JERRY

TONY

JERRY

JANE

Oh that is too bad, what a shame  

JERRY

yeah, it's a damn shame, a damn shame!  

JANE

JERRY

yeah without a doubt, I'm down (Kramer enters) oh hey how're you doing? Jane this is my neighbor Kramer  

KRAMER

JANE

hello Kramer (he acts all weird, a la Kramer)  

KRAMER

well hello Jane  

JANE

Jerry told me so much about you, I feel like I know you intimately  

KRAMER

(very quickly) oh I don't think so, no we never met, I never talked to you before on the phone, alright I'll see you later buddy  

JERRY

wait, where are you going? where are you going?  

KRAMER

uptown, to the Y  

JANE

oh I'm going uptown too, you wanna split a cab?  

KRAMER

JANE

JERRY

JANE

JERRY

Ok. 

JANE

KRAMER

JERRY

KRAMER

Erika, she's Erika  

JERRY

oh you think she's Erika, the phone sex woman  

KRAMER

Jerry, that voice is tattooed on my brain, I'm telling you it's her  

JERRY

oh you're crazy  

KRAMER

Am I? Or am I so sane that you just blew your mind?  

JERRY

It's impossible  

KRAMER

iIs it? Or is it so possible your heard is spinning like a top?  

JERRY

it can't be  

KRAMER

Can't it? Or is your entire world just crashing down all around you?  

JERRY

alright that's enough  

KRAMER

yeaaaaah!  

ELAINE

he's supposed to get the bandages off on Sunday.. what if?  

JERRY

what?  

ELAINE

you know (acts like a monster)  

JERRY

oh you're afraid he might look like Zippy the pinhead  

ELAINE

yeah I mean, I mean what is my obligation here, you know we were just dating, it was probably gonna be over in a couple of weeks anyway  

JERRY

oh I though you didn't care about his looks  

ELAINE

I lied  

JERRY

aha  

ELAINE

are you kidding, he's a mimbo I know that.. but he's my mimbo, you know and even if he is a hideous freak maybe, maybe I can learn to love him, maybe in some final irony (Jerry is looking the other way), I'll learn what love really is. You know Jerry  

JERRY

oh I'm sorry I didn't get most of that.. isn't that Kramer over there?  

ELAINE

yeah, yeah  

JERRY

hey Kramer  

KRAMER

what? hey (walks by Jerry and Elaine's table) it's all set  

JERRY

what's all set?  

KRAMER

Erika is gonna meet me here, now we're gonna find out the truth  

JERRY

how's you get her to meet here?  

KRAMER

I don't know, we have a certain chemistry  

JERRY

oh my god  

JANE

hi I thought I'd find you here  

JERRY

hello.. Erika  

JANE

Erika? what are you talking about?  

JERRY

how can u say things like that over the phone?  

JANE

what things? What are you talking about?  

JERRY

selling sexual pleasure over the phone?  

JANE

I sell paper goods you jerk  

JERRY

paper goods?  

ELAINE

excuse me, do you have a tissue?  

JANE

No, I'm sorry, I can't spare it, there's not enough to spare  

JANE

Where's the ladies' room (Kramer points her)  

ELAINE

I have to go to the bathroom too (runs to be ahead of Jane; Jane stops and looks back at Jerry; Jerry shugs)  

JANE

oh damn  

ELAINE

something.. wrong?  

JANE

yeah there's no toilet paper in here, I usually check but would you mind?  

ELAINE

I can't, I don't have it, I don't have a square to spare, I can't spare a square  

JANE

Hey, wait a minute, I know you  

ELAINE

that's right honey, and I know you!  

JANE

no, no, no!!!  

ELAINE

here, take it  

JERRY

thanks 

JANE

(walks out of the bathroom, very furious; to Jerry) don't call me anymore  

JANE

(to Kramer, in a very sensual voice) you either  

JERRY

Now of the course the thing is Extreme sports. Bungie jumping. To me if Bungie jumping is a sport so is being a crash test dummy. Just leaning does not make it a sport. It's like a Wiley Coyote idea isn't it? The thing I wonder about the sky diving is why do they even bother with the helmets? Can you almost make it? Why don't they just wear a party hat? What's the difference? You jump out of a plane from twenty thousand feet in the air the chute doesn't open I got news for you, the helmet is now wearing you for protection. Later on the helmet's talking to the other helmets going 'boy it's a good thing he was there or I would have hit the ground directly.'  

ELAINE

Hey, do you believe I got Happy New Yeared today? It's February. 

JERRY

I once got Happy New Yeared in March. 

ELAINE

It's disgusting. 

JERRY

It's pathetic. . . . hey, is it cold out? 

ELAINE

Really cold. 

JERRY

Scary cold. 

ELAINE

I don't know. What's your definition of scary cold? 

JERRY

That. (pointing at George) 

ELAINE

(Laughing as she says it) What is that, ha? 

GEORGE

What? 

JERRY

When did you get that? 

GEORGE

This week. My father got a deal from a friend of his. It's Gore-Tex. You know about Gore-Tex? 

JERRY

You like saying Gore-Tex, don't you? 

ELAINE

Hey, you can't even turn around in that thing. 

JERRY

Look at this 

ELAINE

Hey George, can you feel this? Can you ... 

GEORGE

All right, all right. KNOCK IT OFF. Come on, let's go. 

ELAINE

Oh listen we should stop off on the way and get a bottle of wine or something. 

JERRY

Yeah. (pointing at Elaine as he goes into the bedroom) 

GEORGE

What for? 

ELAINE

These people invited us for dinner. We have to bring something. 

GEORGE

Why? 

ELAINE

Because it's rude, otherwise. 

GEORGE

You mean just going there because I'm invited, that's rude? 

ELAINE

Yes. 

GEORGE

So you're telling me instead of them being happy to see me, they're going to be upset because I didn't bring anything. Ttst --You see what I'm saying? 

JERRY

The fabric of society is very complex George. 

GEORGE

I don't even drink wine. I drink Pepsi. 

ELAINE

Ya can't bring Pepsi. (Elaine starts putting on her coat and gloves) 

GEORGE

Why not? 

ELAINE

Because we're adults? 

GEORGE

You telling me that wine is better than Pepsi? Huh (snort), no way wine is better than Pepsi. 

JERRY

I tell you George, I don't think we want to walk in there and put a big plastic jug of Pepsi in the middle of the table. 

GEORGE

I just don't like the idea that any time there's a dinner invitation there's this annoying little chore that goes along with it. 

JERRY

You know, you're getting to be an annoying little chore yourself. 

KRAMER

All right, let's go. Who's driving? (claps his hands and rubs them together) 

JERRY

You are. I can't get that thing in my car. (referring to George) 

KRAMER

Uh huh. 

JERRY

Where's the heat in this car? Come on Elaine warm me up, oh! I'm cold. Just give me a little squeeze. 

ELAINE

Jerry get off of me. Get off of ME! Get off, Get off of Me! 

GEORGE

Hehehehehe (higher tone laugh, though still quietly ) 

JERRY

You're pretty comfortable up there eh, Bubble boy? 

GEORGE

Oh, yeah. You wish you had this coat. 

ELAINE

You know, I was just thinking. The four of us can't show up with just one bottle of wine. 

GEORGE

Oh, here we go... 

ELAINE

What? 

GEORGE

Why don't we get them a couch? (Kramer laughs) We'll rent a U-haul -- we'll bring 'em a nice sectional. 

KRAMER

(low tone)Yeahhehehehe 

ELAINE

We should bring some cake. Will you stop off at the bakery? 

KRAMER

(low tone) All right, yeah. 

GEORGE

Why don't you just get some Ring Dings from the liquor store? 

ELAINE

Ring Dings? 

GEORGE

Hey, Ring Dings are better than anything you're gonna get at a bakery. 

KRAMER

Ooooh I like Ring Dings. 

ELAINE

George, we can't show up at someone's house with Ring Dings and Pepsi. 

KRAMER

HEY YOUR LIGHTS ARE ON! (shouting out the window) 

GEORGE

(to Kramer) It's a funeral procession. . . . (to Elaine) And I got news for you. I show up with Ring Dings and Pepsi, I become the biggest hit of the party. People be coming up to me, 'just between you and me I'm really excited about the Ring Dings and the Pepsi. What are we, Europeans with the Beaujolais and Chardonnay . . . 

ELAINE

Oh, Kramer, that's the bakery. Stop here. Stop here. 

KRAMER

(low tone) All right. 

ELAINE

Okay, let me out. You, eh, whatever your name is... 

JERRY

Jerry. 

ELAINE

Yeah, Jerry, Jerry -- come with me. 

KRAMER

Okay, so we're going to get the wine and we'll pick you up here in ten minutes. 

ELAINE

Yeah. 

KRAMER

All right 

ELAINE

Ummm, I love the smell of bakeries. 

JERRY

Mmm. Oh look Elaine, the black and white cookie. 

ELAINE

Mmm. 

JERRY

I love the black and white. Two races of flavor living side by side in harmony. It's a wonderful thing isn't it? 

ELAINE

You know I often wonder what you'll be like when you're senile. 

JERRY

I'm looking forward to it. 

ELAINE

Yeah. I think it will be a very smooth transition for you. 

JERRY

Thank you. All right, look at all this stuff. What are we getting'? 

ELAINE

CHOCOLATE BABKA! That's their specialty. 

JERRY

Love that babka. 

ELAINE

Yeah, yeah! 

JERRY

So listen Elaine, when we get up to the door, you , you hold the cake box. 

ELAINE

Why? 

JERRY

I don't know, just standing there with a box, holding it by the little string. 

ELAINE

You think it's effeminate? 

JERRY

It's a tad dainty. 

ELAINE

Oh, we forgot to pick a number. 

JERRY

Oh, see that's not fair. We-We were here ahead of all these people. 

ELAINE

I-cu-di-ge--You think I should go and ask her for hers? 

JERRY

Ah, no, forget it. 

ELAINE

No, no no no, no it's not fair. Just because they have a ticket doesn't mean they were here first. We were here, and we were ahead of them, and them, and her. Come on let's just go ask 'em. Come on. . . . Excuse me. 

KRAMER

(exhales) Well, I'm not finding a spot here. What do you want to do? 

GEORGE

Ah, Just double park. 

KRAMER

No, no. 

GEORGE

Why not? 

KRAMER

I'll get a ticket! Besides, what if somebody wants to get out of here? 

GEORGE

Are you kidding? People get spaces this good, they never give 'em up. 

KRAMER

That's a fallacy. 

GEORGE

All right, I'll tell you what... why don't you go into the store and I'll wait in the car? 

KRAMER

Why don't YOU go into the store and I'LL wait in the car? 

GEORGE

Because, I've got the coat. I can sit in the car and not get cold. 

KRAMER

So what I'm going to leave the car running and the heat 'll be on. 

GEORGE

Does the heater even work in this car? 

KRAMER

No. 

GEORGE

Oh, Hey, eh, there's a spot right in front of the liquor store. You see 

KRAMER

I see. 

GEORGE

You see, hu, ho ho. 

ELAINE

But we were here ahead of you. 

BARBARA

How do I know that? 

JERRY

Well we saw you come in. 

DAVID

Well, that's easy for you to say. 

ELAINE

Oh, yeah, right, that's something I do all the time, right. I make up stories to get ahead in lines at bakeries. 

CLERK

46? 

ELAINE

Wait, wait a second are, are you Barbara Benedict? 

BARBARA

Yes. 

ELAINE

Oh my god. I, I know you. I-I'm, I'm Elaine Benes. Do you remember we met at Linda van Grak's baby shower. 

BARBARA

I'm on my way over there right now. 

ELAINE

Yeah me too. 

DAVID

You're Jerry right? 

JERRY

David! 

ELAINE

Well, this is a little awkward, isn't it? 

BARBARA

Yes it is. 

ELAINE

You know we were here, ahead of you. 

BARBARA

You're NOT getting my number. 

JERRY

Oh so you still don't believe us. 

CLERK

47! 

BARBARA

That's Us. 

ELAINE

Ohhh, OK, fine, fine, go ahead. But listen let me tell you something as soon as I get there I'm going to tell everyone what a jerk you are. 

BARBARA

Well, I'll be there ahead of you and I'LL be telling them what a jerk YOU are. . . . (turns to the counter) I'll have the chocolate babka. 

CLERK

You're lucky Mrs. Benedict it's our last one. 

GEORGE

Alright, what are we getting? It's hot in here! 

KRAMER

Ooo, What do you say we get a Mouton Cadet? 

GEORGE

What's that? 

KRAMER

Well its a Bordeaux. Robust, bold, very dry. As opposed to a Beaujolais -- which is richer and fruitier. Ahh, here's one. Twelve dollars. 

GEORGE

Twelve dollars? I knew we should have gone to the bakery. I guarantee you they're not getting no twelve dollar cake. 

KRAMER

All right look, I am going to have to pay you back later. I don't have my wallet. 

GEORGE

. . . Why not? 

KRAMER

Because I don't like to carry my wallet. My Osteopath says that it's bad for my spine. It throws my hips off kilter. (makes a motion with his hips) 

GEORGE

'throws your hips off kilter' So where's your money? (pulls out his wallet) 

KRAMER

I never take it. 

GEORGE

So what do you do? 

KRAMER

Oh, I get by. 

BARBARA

See you later (exits with the babka) 

JERRY

See you later. 

JERRY

That's the last babka. They got the last babka. 

ELAINE

I know. They're going in first with the last babka. 

JERRY

That was our babka. 

ELAINE

You can't beat a babka. 

JERRY

We had that babka. 

ELAINE

(exhales) They're going to be heroes. 

JERRY

Well what are we going to do now. If we can't get the babka the whole thing's useless. 

ELAINE

Well how about a carrot cake? 

JERRY

Carrot cake? Now w-why is that a cake? You don't make carrots into a cake. I'm sorry. 

ELAINE

Black Forrest? 

JERRY

Black Forrest? Too scary. You're in the Forrest, oohh. 

JERRY

How about a Napoleon? 

ELAINE

Napoleon? Who's he to have a cake? He was a ruthless war monger. Might as well get Mengele. 

JERRY

That was our babka. We had that babka! 

ELAINE

What's this one? 

CLERK

That, Cinnamon Babka. 

ELAINE

(gasp) 

JERRY

Another babka? 

CLERK

There's chocolate and there's cinnamon. 

JERRY

Well-well we got to get the cinnamon. 

ELAINE

No, but they got the chocolate. We'll be going in with lesser babka. 

JERRY

I beg your pardon? Cinnamon takes a back seat to no babka. People love cinnamon. It should be on tables in restaurants along with salt and pepper. Anytime anyone says, 'Oh This is so good. What's in it?' The answer invariably comes back, Cinnamon. Cinnamon. Again and again. Lesser babka - I think not. 

CLERK

49? 

ELAINE

I'll have a cinnamon babka. 

JERRY

... and a black and white cookie, for me. Peace! 

CLERK

That'll be 13.05 

GEORGE

All right here you go. 

KRAMER

Yeuu. 

CLERK

A hundred? I can't change that. 

GEORGE

You can't - huhu, All right let's go. 

KRAMER

Wait a second. I can get change. 

KRAMER

Hey, anybody got change for a hundred? 

GEORGE

Are you crazy?! What are you doing?! You'll get us killed! 

KRAMER

What? 

GEORGE

Don't go shouting we got a hundred dollar bill. People will be jumping out of windows on top of us. 

KRAMER

Alright, Let's go but something. Then we'll get some change. 

GEORGE

I am not buying something just to get change. 

KRAMER

George, there's a news stand right over there. Now come on. 

GEORGE

All right, what are we doing? 

KRAMER

Just get some gum or something. 

GEORGE

Pack of gum. Here you go. (hands the clerk a $100 bill) 

CLERK

What is it a hundred? I can't change a hundred. 

GEORGE

Why not? 

CLERK

You got to buy more than that. 

KRAMER

Here, get a newspaper. (Kramer hands George a Newspaper) 

GEORGE

Newspaper. 

CLERK

Not enough. 

KRAMER

Clark Bar. (Kramer starts tearing the candy wrapper open with his teeth.) 

GEORGE

Clark Bar. 

CLERK

Keep going. 

GEORGE

We're up to two dollars here. 

KRAMER

Here, George, get a Penthouse Forum. 

GEORGE

I'm not getting a Penthouse Forum. 

KRAMER

Why? No, that'll make great dinner party conversation. We'll read the letters at the dinner table. 

GEORGE

Oh, that's nice. 

KRAMER

Come on, did you ever read one of these? 

GEORGE

It's not real. They're all made up. 

KRAMER

Ohh, it's real. 

GEORGE

Well you know there is an unusual number of people in this country having sex with AMPUTEES! (grabs the forum from Kramer and walks over to the clerk) . . . Penthouse forum, newspaper, gum, Clark Bar. 

CLERK

6.75. 

GEORGE

Ah, great. All right, with the wine I'm in over twenty dollars now. 

KRAMER

All right, all right. 

GEORGE

Yes, I'm Sorry, it's a new coat. It-it's Gore-Tex. 

KRAMER

You better be careful with that thing... You'll start a war. 

JERRY

Uhm, see the key to eating a Black and White cookie, Elaine, is you want to get some black and some white in each bite. Nothing mixes better than, vanilla and chocolate. And yet still somehow racial harmony eludes us. If people would only *Look to the Cookie* -- all our problems would be solved. 

ELAINE

Well your views on race relations are just, fascinating. You really should do an Op-Ed piece for the Times. (Op-Ed stands for Opinions and Editorials) 

JERRY

Hmm. Look to the cookie Elaine... Look to the cookie. 

ELAINE

(looking in the box) Well what is this? 

JERRY

What? 

ELAINE

It's a hair. 

JERRY

Oh, oh take it back. Let's get another one. 

ELAINE

No, we're late as it is. I'll just take it off. 

JERRY

No no come on really, get another one. It'll take a second. 

ELAINE

Alright, alright. 

ELAINE

Excuse me. 

ELAINE

No noo no, we just bought this. . . . Um, you sold us a cake with a (quietly) hair on it. 

CLERK

You have to take a number. 

ELAINE

We waited fifteen minutes for this. Tst - YOU SELL ME A CAKE WITH A HAIR ON IT. Then you want me to wait? . . . What are you doing (to Jerry taking a number) you're gonna wait now? 

JERRY

Well, I'm not going to eat a cake with a hair on it. 

ELAINE

Well it was a little hair. I took it off. 

JERRY

A little hair? Do you think that makes it better? 

ELAINE

What if it's your hair? 

JERRY

What if it's your hair? 

ELAINE

(Wh-wh) What is wrong with my hair? Nobody takes better care of their hair than me. You can serve dinner on my head. 

JERRY

Who needs that misty herbal rain water crap they sell in the health food store. I use Prell, the hard stuff. Hundred proof - takes your roots out. (pretends to pull hair out) 

ELAINE

Okay, fine, we'll just wait until she calls the number. 

JERRY

Well, maybe we should just forget about the cake? 

ELAINE

No I'm bringing cake! (looking worried and apprehensive) 

GEORGE

All right we got the wine. Aren't we lucky? We got wine. Whoopee Whoa! Imagine if we didn't bring the wine. We'd be shunned by society. Outcasts! WHERE'S YOUR WINE? GET OUT! 

KRAMER

(reading from the Penthouse Forum) 'I know this is going to sound like a crazy fantasy but every word of this story is true...' (exits to street) ' A few weeks ago my girlfriend happened to mention to me how attractive she thought our new neighbor Linda was...' 

GEORGE

L-Look at this? 

KRAMER

Ahh. 

GEORGE

Somebody double parked and blocked us in. D-DOES ANYBODY KNOW WHOSE CAR THAT IS? Maybe there's a note on it. Ohh-oh brother. No, no note. Can you believe this? 

KRAMER

'...well of course I noticed it too with those cannibal breasts and pouty lips. I don't have to tell you she was a knock out....' (turns the page) 

GEORGE

I really can not comprehend how stupid people could be sometimes. Can you comprehend it? 

KRAMER

No, no I can't comprehend it? 

GEORGE

I mean we can put a man on the moon but we're still basically very stupid. The guy who's car this is? He could be one of the guys that built the rocket. You see what I'm saying? 

KRAMER

Well yeah, yeah. He could build the rocket, but-but he's still stupid for double-parking and blocking somebody in. 

GEORGE

So you really understand my point about building a rocket and double-parking. 

KRAMER

Yeah, on one hand he's smart with rockets and on the other hand he's dumb with parking. . . . It's cold out here huh? 

GEORGE

Maybe it's not even stupidity. Maybe it's just a blatant disregard for basic human decency. Yeah this how dictator's start. Do you think Mussolini would circle the block six times looking for a spot? 

KRAMER

How about Idi Amin, huh? 

GEORGE

I'll tell you, if I was running for office I would ask for the death penalty for double-parkers. If this is allowed to go on this is not a society. THIS IS ANARCHY! 

KRAMER

Are those shoes comfortable? 

GEORGE

No not really. 

KRAMER

Cause they look comfortable. 

GEORGE

I know that's why I bought `em but they're not comfortable. 

ELAINE

Why couldn't we just take the hair off and go? 

JERRY

No. That's out of the question. 

ELAINE

Whhhy? 

JERRY

Because I had a bad experience with a hair when I was younger. 

ELAINE

What happened? 

JERRY

I'd rather not talk about it. 

ELAINE

You can't tell me? 

JERRY

All right . . . . I once found a hair in my Farina and I freaked out. 

ELAINE

You found a hair in your Farina? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

VOICE

56 

ELAINE

What happened? 

JERRY

Well I started screaming, 'There's a hair in my farina. There's a hair in my farina.' Then I ran out of the house and I was running and running. And like I was little but I could run very fast. And I-I just kept running (In the background -- CLERK'S VOICE: 57) and they found me like three hours later collapsed at a construction site. 

ELAINE

(quietly) Wow. Who's hair was it? 

JERRY

My mother's. 

ELAINE

(quietly) Ahhhhh 

CLERK

58! 

ELAINE

Ooo, That's us. (hits Jerry in the arm) 

JERRY

Oh, good. 

ELAINE

You sold us a hair with a cake around it. We'd like another one. 

CLERK

(coughing and coughing, getting really bad) 

JERRY

Oh, that's lovely. 

ELAINE

Ah, 

JERRY

That's what you want to see, yeah. . . . Yeah, you want to trade your hair for some phlegm. 

JERRY

Yeah that's a good deal -- you win the Pennant with that trade, hair for phlegm. 

CLERK

Here you are. (hands Elaine the cake box) 

ELAINE

Okay. Alright we got the cake now. Where is George and Kramer? 

KRAMER

HEY DOUBLE-PARKER! (honk, honk) SHOW YOURSELF. (honk, honk) COME ON OUT, I'M FREEZING! (honk, honk) 

GEORGE

We are really late now. We're in big trouble. Big trouble. 

KRAMER

Why? 

GEORGE

You know -- Elaine. 

KRAMER

What about her? 

GEORGE

. . . I'm a little scared of her. 

KRAMER

You're scared of Elaine? 

GEORGE

Yes! 

KRAMER

Why? 

GEORGE

Did you ever see her lose her temper. I was once late cause I bought a Panama hat -- she grabbed it by the brim, pulled it down so hard my head came right through the top of it. 

KRAMER

Hey, let's go inside the liquor store. I'm freezin in here. 

GEORGE

Why didn't you just wear a heavier coat? 

KRAMER

Because I wanted to look good for the party. 

GEORGE

Oh, Hey, hey, hey! That's great! That's very nice. You know we've been waiting twenty minutes for you people?! What do you think, you're Mussolini?! 

GEORGE

I wasn't talking to you. 

ELAINE

Wait `til I get my hands on that George. I am gonna *pull* that big hood over his little head... tie the strings, and suffocate. You remember that Panama hat? That was nothing. 

JERRY

Huh, wa? 

ELAINE

What's the matter with you? 

JERRY

I don't know, I don't feel so good. 

ELAINE

What's wrong? 

JERRY

My stomach, I , think it was that cookie. 

ELAINE

The black and white? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

ELAINE

Not getting' along? 

JERRY

I think I got David Duke and Farrakhan down there. 

ELAINE

(mocking - in a dopey voice) 'Well if we can't look to the cookie where can we look?' 

JERRY

Oh my stomach. I feel like I'm going to throw up. 

ELAINE

Wait, what about your vomit streak? 

JERRY

I know, I haven't thrown up since June 29th, 1980. 

ELAINE

Oh, oh! Ooh my god. Oh! 

ELAINE

Sorry? You almost took my toe off. Why don't you watch what you're doing you, LUNATIC!... (the man turns and walks away) 

ELAINE

(con't) ...uh, Jerry, I think he broke my toe. (Jerry gets up) W-Where're you going? 

JERRY

Fourteen years down the drain. (points and walks off -- to the bathroom) 

GEORGE

Do you think chickens have individual personalities? 

KRAMER

(shivering) I don't know. 

GEORGE

If you had like five chickens could you tell them apart by just the way they acted? Or would they all just be walking around? Bak, bak, baak, bak? Cause if they have individual personalities I'm not sure we should be eaten `em. What's the matter with you? 

KRAMER

(shivering gibberish) Waj cha jia ja 

CLERK

Can I help you guys with anything? 

GEORGE

Oh, no no no -- We bought the wine here before, but now, you know we're bl-blocked in by some car double parked and we're just waiting for the guy to pull out. 

CLERK

Well wait outside. This isn't a hangout. 

GEORGE

But my friend here has hypothermia. 

KRAMER

(shivering) Hypothermia. 

CLERK

All right guys, take it outside. 

CLERK

You're paying for these. 

ELAINE

How was it? 

JERRY

As good as it gets. 

GEORGE

You know that coat was Gore-Tex. It's worth a hell of a lot more than that, cheap Chardonnay. 

KRAMER

(shivering) You know I'm freezin. I'm definitely freezin. I can't stop shaking. 

GEORGE

I'm cold too. At least you've got a coat. Let's get in the car. 

KRAMER

(quietly) L-l (look) 

GEORGE

Oh, my god that's Saddam Hussein. The dictator. 

CLERK

Can I get'ca anything else? 

JERRY

Oh, no thanks. 

CLERK

How about a nice box of 'scram'. 

GEORGE

S-s-somebody double parked, we couldn't help it. It might have been Saddam Hussein, we're not really sure. He eh, had a British accent though. 

GEORGE

What, what happened to you? 

ELAINE

Somebody put a cane on my foot. Just like the one I'm going to put up your... 

JERRY

Hey, what happened to your coat? And what is the smell? Is-ya, What are you drunk? 

GEORGE

I had to give it to the liquor store guy. 

JERRY

What for? 

GEORGE

I spilled some Chardonnay. So, what did you get? 

ELAINE

Cinnamon babka. 

GEORGE

Cinnamon? Why didn't 'cha get chocolate? 

JERRY

George! 

ELAINE

Here, here's your cake. (just about tosses it at the woman) 

GEORGE

And your wine. 

ELAINE

See ya'. 

JERRY

See ya'. 

ELAINE

(to the phone) Well did he bring it up in the meeting? 

JERRY

Elaine, see this T-shirt, six years I've had this T-shirt. It's my best one, I call him... Golden Boy. 

ELAINE

Yeah, I'm on the phone here. 

JERRY

Golden Boy's always the first shirt I wear out of the laundry. Here... touch Golden Boy! 

ELAINE

No thanks. (to the phone) Yeah, Yeah I'll hold. 

JERRY

But see look at the collar, it's fraying. Golden Boy is slowly dying. Each wash brings him one step closer, that's what makes the T-shirt such a tragic figure. 

ELAINE

Why don't you just let Golden Boy soak in the sink with some Woolight? 

JERRY

No!!! The reason he's the iron man is because he goes out there and plays every game. Wash!!! Spin!!! Rinse!!! Spin!!! You take that away from him, you break his spirit! 

ELAINE

(to the phone)Yeah. Oh! What? He is! Oh! that's fantastic! I'm so excited! Yes I'm excited, OK, OK I'll be in soon! yeah, yeah, I'm coming, I'm coming! OK bye. (Elaine jumps up and dances around) Yuri Testikov, the Russian writer! 

JERRY

The guy who's in the gulag?! 

ELAINE

Yeah! Pendant's publishing his new book, and I'm working on it! Lippman and I are gonna go to the airport on Thursday and pick him up in a limousine! 

JERRY

You wanna barrow Golden Boy! 

ELAINE

Oh! (pushing Jerry) Do you know what this means, it's like working with Tolstoy! 

JERRY

Hey ya know I read an unbelievable thing about Tolstoy the other day, did you know the original title for 'War and Peace' was 'War--What Is It Good For?'! 

ELAINE

... (looking at Jerry for a second then, mockingly nods her head back and forth) ....Ha ha ha ha. 

JERRY

No, no... I'm not kidding Elaine it's true, his mistress didn't like the title and insisted that he change it to 'War and Peace'! 

ELAINE

But it's a line from that song! 

JERRY

That's were they got it from! 

ELAINE

Really? 

JERRY

I'm not joking! 

GEORGE

... You can't handle the truth! (he salutes) (imitating Jack Nicholson [a.k.a. Col. Nathan R. Jessep], from the 1992 movie A Few Good Men) 

JERRY

What? 

GEORGE

(still in Jack's voice) I'm working on my Jack Nicholson, You can't handle the truth! (he salutes) 

ELAINE

What is this your mail? (She takes a magazine and starts flipping through it) 

GEORGE

Yeah, I grabbed it on the way out, I don't want my mother reading it. 

ELAINE

Oh! Your Alumni Magazine. 

JERRY

Your mother reads your mail? 

GEORGE

Yeah. 

JERRY

What do you mean like post-cards an...? 

GEORGE

No, anything. 

JERRY

She doesn't open...? 

GEORGE

She'll open! 

JERRY

You've caught your mother opening envelopes! 

GEORGE

Yes. 

JERRY

What did she say? 

GEORGE

I was curious! (imitating his mom's voice) 

JERRY

Isn't that against the law? 

GEORGE

Maybe I can get her locked up. 

ELAINE

(gasp) Hey Jerry, you're in the Alumni magazine! Listen to this: Jerry Seinfeld has appeared on 'David Letterman' and the 'Tonight Show' and he did a pilot for NBC called 'Jerry' ...that was not picked up. Georgie, how come there's not anything about you in here? 

JERRY

He can't handle the truth! 

ELAINE

All right... (slaps the magazine down on the counter) this is too much fun, I gotta get back to work. (heads for the door) 

KRAMER

(singing) Johnny Yuma was a rebel, Yeah! ... 

KRAMER

Are you all right? 

ELAINE

Yeah. (startled) 

KRAMER

Unh.... Sorry. 

ELAINE

It's OK. (starts walking down the hallway) 

KRAMER

Yeah. Oh, here, wait wait (walks a few steps to catch up to her as she stops) Ah, maybe you could ah, use this (he searches through his jacket) Ah, here, it's a electronic organizer... 

ELAINE

What? 

KRAMER

Ah, Yeah. uh... 

ELAINE

Wh..? 

KRAMER

Yeah, here it is... yeah. 

KRAMER

You know, for phone numbers, addresses, keep appointments, everything. 

ELAINE

Wow! 

KRAMER

It's got an alarm that beeps! 

ELAINE

Oh! I can't believe this, Kramer! 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

ELAINE

I've been wanting to get one of these things! Are you sure that... 

ELAINE

...Are you sure you can't use this thing? 

KRAMER

No no no. I got all my appointments up here. (he points to his head) 

ELAINE

Where'd you get this? 

KRAMER

Well, the bank, I opened up a new account. 

GEORGE

Hey, did you see that whale thing on TV last night? 

JERRY

No. 

GEORGE

I am such a Huge whale fan. These marine biologists were showin' how they communicate with each other with these squeaks and squeals, what a fish! 

JERRY

It's a mammal. 

GEORGE

Whatever. (George looks to the table) Hey new tape recorder? 

JERRY

Yeah, got it from the bank. 

KRAMER

(overly excited) Hey (Claps hands one time) 

JERRY

Hey. 

GEORGE

Hey. 

KRAMER

(still overly excited) Who wants to have some fun! 

JERRY

I do. 

GEORGE

I do. 

KRAMER

(once again, overly excited) Now are you just sayin' you want to have fun or do you reallllly want to have fun?! 

JERRY

I really wanna have fun. 

GEORGE

I'm just sayin' I wanna have some fun. 

KRAMER

Right now there six-hundred Titleists that I got from the driving range in the trunk of my car. Why don't we drive out to Rock-a-Way... and hit `em-----------(very over excited) into the ocean! Now picture this.... we find a nice sweet spot between the dunes, we take out our drivers, we tee up and (he makes a golf stroke), that ball goes sailing up into the sky holds there for a moment and then....... ..... gulp! 

GEORGE

Come on. Ya wanna go get some lunch? 

JERRY

Yeah, let me just stop by the cash machine and I'll meet you over at the coffee shop. 

GEORGE

Yeah, I'm gonna get a paper. 

GEORGE

Keep your head down. 

KRAMER

Yeah! (Kramer takes a huge imaginary swing) 

JERRY

(he hits a few keys and looks over at her) Cash advance... yes (hits a key) ... no (he looks over again) balance inquiry... no (he looks again) receipt.... no (he looks again) processing... processing... (He opens the box, pulls out his money and then looks at the woman and says) I won! 

DIANE

Jerry? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

DIANE

It's Diane, Diane DeConn, from Queens college. 

JERRY

Oh Diane. 

DIANE

(laughing a little) How are you? 

JERRY

Good, good. 

DIANE

(sighs) How long has it been? 

JERRY

Since college. 

DIANE

Huh. I've been seeing you on TV you're doin' great. 

JERRY

Yeah pluggin' along. 

DIANE

You know I got the Alumni magazine. What ever happened to your friend George? I notice I never see his name in there. 

JERRY

Well he's kind of modest. 

DIANE

He was always such a goof-off. I mean did he ever get anywhere? 

JERRY

Sure. 

DIANE

Yeah? What field? 

JERRY

Marine biology. 

DIANE

George is a marine biologist?! 

JERRY

Yeah, pretty damn good one, too! 

DIANE

I can't believe it. I-I would never had thought... 

JERRY

Yeah... he's specializing in whales. He's working on lowering the cholesterol level, in whales... all that blubber -- quite unhealthy. You know it's the largest mammal on earth but as George says 'they don't have to be.' 

GEORGE

Diane DeConn? You saw Diane DeConn! 

JERRY

Something huh? 

GEORGE

Ahh! How'd she look? 

JERRY

She looked great. 

GEORGE

Ahh! (closes his eyes and rolling his head back) Umh! 

JERRY

She asked about you. 

GEORGE

She asked about me? What did- What did she say? 

JERRY

'How's George?' 

GEORGE

George! She said George? She remembered my name. (loudly -- to a passing waitress and the rest of the restaurant) Diane DeConn remembered my name. She was the 'it' girl! 

JERRY

Yeah she asked for your number, I think she's gonna get in touch with you. 

GEORGE

(pauses for a few seconds) ...OK, I'm tellin' you right now - if your kiddin' around I'm not gonna be able to be your friend anymore. I'm serious about that. You got that. 

JERRY

I got no problem with that. 

GEORGE

Good. Cause if this is a lie, if this is a joke, if this is your idea of some cute little game... we're finished! 

JERRY

Expect a call. 

GEORGE

Oh my god he's not kidding. (exhale gasp) 

JERRY

Now, I should tell you... that, at this point, she's under the impression that you're - a - ah... 

GEORGE

A what? 

JERRY

A marine biologist. 

GEORGE

(pauses) A marine biologist? 

JERRY

Yes. 

GEORGE

Why am I a marine biologist? 

JERRY

I may have mentioned it. 

GEORGE

But I'm not a marine biologist! 

JERRY

Yes I know that. 

GEORGE

So? 

JERRY

Why, you don't think it's a good job? 

GEORGE

I didn't even know it was a job. 

JERRY

Oh it's a fascinating field! 

GEORGE

Well what if she calls me? What am I supposed to say?! (hand hits the table) 

GEORGE

Algae,... obviously plankton, hmhm. I don't know what else I could tell ya, ah, Oh I-I just got back from a trip to the Galapagos Islands, I was living with the turtles. 

LIPPMAN

We have got you in a very nice hotel, I-I don't know how you like to work, but ah, I can arrange for an office if you like. 

TESTIKOV

(Russian accent) I work in hotel. 

LIPPMAN

Oh. 

TESTIKOV

... is better. 

TESTIKOV

Away from all your little petty bickerings and interference. 

LIPPMAN

You know, Tolstoy use to write in the village square. The faces inspired him. 

TESTIKOV

(proudly) He did not need inspiration... God spoke through his pen. Hu Hu Hu (pounds his fist lightly on his heart) 

ELAINE

Ohh, That is so true! (clutches her hands to her chest) 

LIPPMAN

Yes. 

ELAINE

Although one wonders if 'War and Peace' would has been as highly acclaimed as it was, had it was published under it's original title 'War---What Is It Good For?' 

LIPPMAN

What? 

ELAINE

Yeah. Mr. Lippman. It was *his mistress* who insisted that he call it... 

LIPPMAN

Elaine... 

ELAINE

'War and Peace.' 

LIPPMAN

Elaine... 

ELAINE

'War--What Is It Good For.' (sings) Absolutely nothin' HUH! Say it Again! ahehehehe 

TESTIKOV

(quietly) Ahhuuh 

ELAINE

(spoken to Testikov) that's a song ... 

LIPPMAN

It... (frustrated and trying to keep her from saying more) 

ELAINE

...they-they took it from Tolstoy. 

LIPPMAN

No. e-Elaine. 

TESTIKOV

War--What Is It Good For? 

LIPPMAN

It-no- it's just her sense of humor. 

ELAINE

No it's not. That really is true. 

TESTIKOV

What is that noise! 

LIPPMAN

It's Not... 

ELAINE

Yes it is... 

LIPPMAN

No It's Not!! 

TESTIKOV

That noise! ... 

LIPPMAN

it-it-it's her purse. 

TESTIKOV

Where is that noise? It's traveling up my spine! Into my Brain! 

ELAINE

Oh, I... 

LIPPMAN

It's coming from your purse. 

ELAINE

Oh... It must be my new organizer. 

TESTIKOV

That noise! ... 

LIPPMAN

Yes...Turn it off. 

ELAINE

Right, I think it's this... 

LIPPMAN

No it's the Button. Elaine... 

TESTIKOV

I can not stand it! 

LIPPMAN

It's the button at the top, the top. 

ELAINE

OK. I don't quite know... 

TESTIKOV

Will you Turn it off! 

LIPPMAN

The one at the top. 

ELAINE

Yeah, I'm gonna work on that... 

TESTIKOV

Aaach! 

LIPPMAN

Yeah... Ohoo. 

JERRY

I did it for you. 

GEORGE

I don't know what'cha had to tell her that for. You put me in a very difficult position, Marine Biologist! I'm very uncomfortable with this whole thing. 

JERRY

You know with all do respect I would think it's right up your alley. 

GEORGE

Well it's not up my alley! It's one thing if I make it up. I know what I'm doin, I know my alleys! You got me in the Galapagos Islands livin' with the turtles, I don't know where the hell I am. 

JERRY

Well you came in the other day with all that whale stuff, the squeaking and the squealing and... 

GEORGE

Look, why couldn't you make me an architect? You know I always wanted to pretend that I was an architect. Well I-I'm supposed to see her tomorrow, I-I-I'm gonna tell her what's goin on. I mean maybe she just likes me for me. 

KRAMER

Hey. 

JERRY

Hey. 

KRAMER

Hey ya want these (He throws down the golf clubs -- kicks the bag hard) I don't want em! 

JERRY

What? 

KRAMER

I stink! I can't play! The ball is just sitting there, Jerry, and I can't hit it! I only hit one really good ball that went way out there! 

JERRY

Well what happened? 

KRAMER

I have no concentration! 

JERRY

What, what, what's wrong with you? 

KRAMER

Sand, I can get rid of the sand. (he sits at the table, looking down his shirt) Look there's still some in here, it won't go away! Look I even got sand in the pockets! 

JERRY

Hey come on, you're getting it all over the floor! 

JERRY

(to the phone) Hello... yeah... yes it is... really... ah, ah... Could you hold on a second? (to George and Kramer) Hey listen to this, some woman found an electronic organizer, my name was in it, she wants me to help her track down the owner. 

GEORGE

How'd she find it? 

JERRY

She's waking down the street and it hit her in the head! 

CORINNE

So I am walkin' along, minding my own business when all off the sudden this thing comes flying out of nowhere and clonks me right on the head. 

JERRY

Wow. 

CORINNE

Yeah, So they took me to the hospital... 

JERRY

Yeah... 

CORINNE

...and they put me in this thing, that feels like a coffin, for forty-five minutes. Have you ever been in one of those things? You could go berserk in there! 

JERRY

Well you have insurance... 

CORINNE

I wish! 

JERRY

Unbelievable! 

CORINNE

Yeah. 

JERRY

What is with this thing. 

CORINNE

(hits the organizer) I don't know, it never shuts up. So anyway, you could see why I would be interested in finding this person. 

JERRY

Absolutely. You should not have to pay for that. 

CORINNE

(hits the organizer, picks it up and hits it on to the table -- shouting) Stop it! Stop it! 

JERRY

Let me have a look at this thing. 

CORINNE

Ya know it was somebody told me they thought they saw that thing come out of a limousine. 

JERRY

Typical rich people, using the world for their personal garbage can. 

CORINNE

Boy am I lucky your name came up. I just pushed a button. 

JERRY

I would like to know what my name's doin in this creep's organizer to begin with. 

CORINNE

Yeah. 

JERRY

Who do I know who would have even been in a limousine yesterday anyway. Uhh-O h-owow! 

KRAMER

Wha-- Oh, hey. 

ELAINE

Hey, 'great' organizer you gave me. 

KRAMER

Oh, you liked it huh. 

ELAINE

It wouldn't stop beeping, in the car so Testikov, through it out the window. 

KRAMER

Oh. (continuing to itch and scratch from the sand) 

ELAINE

I transferred everything in there. I threw out my old book. I'm lost now, Kramer. 

ELAINE

What, what is it? 

KRAMER

The sand, it's everywhere! (blows on his arm) 

ELAINE

OK I'll see you later. 

KRAMER

Yei- 

JERRY

Oh, there you are! 

ELAINE

There you are! 

JERRY

So? 

ELAINE

So? 

JERRY

So what do you have to say for yourself? 

ELAINE

So what do you have to say for yourself? 

JERRY

Why should I have anything for say for myself? 

ELAINE

'War-- What is it good for?'! 

JERRY

A-Ahahahahah. Who told you? 

ELAINE

A-hu hu hu hu. Yuri Testikov, the Russian writer! Hellooo! 

JERRY

You told Testikov, (Elaine nods) that Tolstoy wanted to name his book 'War-- What Is IT Good For?'? 

ELAINE

Uh-hu. And do you know what happened? 

JERRY

Can I take a guess? 

ELAINE

Oh, Please. 

JERRY

Oh I don't know, he threw your organizer out the window? 

ELAINE

What, how did you know that? 

JERRY

Because I know who has it. 

ELAINE

(gasps) How did you find it? 

JERRY

Because the woman who got hit in the head with it found my name, called me up, and we met! 

ELAINE

(gasps) Where is it, give it to me! 

JERRY

I don't have it! 

ELAINE

Why not. 

JERRY

Because she's not returning it until she gets the money back for the hospital bill. 

ELAINE

But I didn't do it. Testikov did it, he should pay for it! 

JERRY

How much is Testikov getting from Pendant for this book? 

ELAINE

One million. 

JERRY

Well that's a start. 

GEORGE

Then of course with evolution, the octopus lost the nostrils and took on the more familiar look that we know today. 

DIANE

Uh-Really? 

GEORGE

Yeah, but if you still look closely you can see ah, a little bump where the nose use to be. huhuhuhu. 

DIANE

Wow. 

GEORGE

But enough about fish, huhuhu. I can discuss other things you know, ah... architecture. Huhu. (makes a wide gesture with his arms) 

JERRY

You know what room Testikov's in? 

ELAINE

Yeah, 308. Oh, I'm crazy for doing this! 

JERRY

Well, you want your organizer back don't you? 

ELAINE

Why are you so interested -- you want to take her out? 

JERRY

Hey you know when Superman saves someone no one asks if he's trying to hit on her! 

ELAINE

Well, you're not Superman. 

JERRY

Well you're not Lois Lane. 

ELAINE

Oh. Listen, you got the tape-recorder. 

JERRY

Yeah I got it. You sure you want to do this? (hands Elaine the tape recorder.) 

ELAINE

Yeah I gotta get Testikov on tape. If this woman ends up in the 'New England Journal Of Medicine' I'm not gonna pay for it. 

JERRY

Oh, here she comes. 

JERRY

Hi. 

CORINNE

Hi. 

JERRY

Elaine, this is Corinne. 

CORINNE

Hello. 

ELAINE

Hi, (sighs) you got the organizer? 

JERRY

All right lets go. We'll meet you back down here in ten minutes, hopefully with the money. 

DIANE

Your parents must be so proud of you, George. 

GEORGE

Oh, they're busting! 

DIANE

Hmhm. 

DIANE

What are those people doing over there? 

TESTIKOV

(In a loud and cranky voice) What, Come in - come in - Come in Miss Benes! That is if you can spare a minute from your busy schedule! And you bring guest for my entertainment? 

ELAINE

Um, yes this is my friend Jerry. Um, he accompanied me, ya know (clears throat), single women in a big city can be dangerous, so... 

JERRY

Yeah. Th-That's why I where these sneakers, in case of any trouble -- Zip, I'm gone. (makes a running motion with both arms and his right foot) 

TESTIKOV

Yeah, Yeah. The sneakers. All the Americans with the sneakers. Always running from something. Ya ya, well Sit, stop running, Ehh. two minutes, I give you latest manuscript! 

JERRY

Oh! Rimsky -- great great book if I may say so sir. I almost read the whole thing. 

ELAINE

Hmm. (she nods in agreement) 

CORINNE

What! 

CLERK

If you can't thing off, I'll have to ask you to leave. 

CORINNE

I'm waitin for two people! (takes a drag on the cigarette) 

CLERK

Well you can wait for them outside. 

CORINNE

Yeah, (she blows smoke out as she speaks -- it rises as in front of her) I guess I'd better. I wouldn't want to take any attention away from the hookers! 

CLERK

All right, All right. Out, Out. 

CORINNE

Whatever you say, Cro..w-well! 

DIANE

What's going on over here? 

BEACH

There is a beached whale, she's dying. 

VOICE

Is anyone here a marine biologist? 

TESTIKOV

Here is latest draft. I see you next week. Same time, same day. (smacks the manuscript into Elaine's hand) On time please. 

ELAINE

(quietly) OK. 

JERRY

It was nice meeting you... 

TESTIKOV

Aah. 

JERRY

... you're a real pleasure. (Jerry is being sarcastic) 

TESTIKOV

Ya ya. (wipes his nose with a handkerchief) 

ELAINE

Uh-Oh-ah, by the way Mr. Testikov um, do you remember the other day when we were in the limo and ah, my organizer started making noise and you threw it out the window? 

TESTIKOV

(quietly) yes. How could I forget? heehe. 

ELAINE

( laughs) Well um, would you believe that it actually, hit somebody in the head. 

JERRY

Right in the head! (leans in and points at Testikov) 

ELAINE

Boing! Hehe hehe. (makes a hand gesture to her forehead and away) 

TESTIKOV

(Shouting) What is that noise! 

ELAINE

Oh that's nothing. Um and anyway um... 

TESTIKOV

What's going on Huh! (he grabs Elaine's purse) That Noise!... 

ELAINE

No, No that's my purse! 

TESTIKOV

That Noise! 

ELAINE

No, get-get off my purse! 

TESTIKOV

Agh, it's recorder! 

ELAINE

No that's... Radio! 

TESTIKOV

Ha! (he clicks the player off) You are spying on me! 

CROWD

Come on! Save the whale! You gotta do it! 

DIANE

Save the whale George... for me. 

GEORGE

So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified! But I pressed on -- and as I made my way passed the breakers a strange calm came over me. I-I don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment ... I was a Marine Biologist! 

ELAINE

George I've just reading this thing in the paper, it's unbelievable! 

GEORGE

I know I was just telling them the story. 

KRAMER

Well come on George, finish the story. 

GEORGE

The sea was angry that day my friends... like an old man trying to send back soup in a deli! 

GEORGE

I got about fifty-feet out and suddenly, the great beast appeared before me. I tell ya he was ten stories high if he was a foot. As if sensing my presence he let out a great bellow. I said, 'Easy big fella!' And then, as I watched him struggling I realized, that something was obstructing its' breathing. From where I was standing I could see directly into the eye of the great fish! 

JERRY

Mammal. 

GEORGE

Whatever. 

KRAMER

Well then, what did you do next? 

GEORGE

Well then, from out of nowhere, a huge tidal wave lifted me, tossed like a cork and I found myself right on top of him, (ELAINE: gasps quietly Ahhhh) face to face with the blow-hole. I-I, I could barely see from the waves crashing down upon me but, I knew something was there... so I reached my hand in, felt around and pulled out the obstruction! 

KRAMER

What is that a Titleist? 

GEORGE

(Silently squinches his mouth and nods at Kramer) 

KRAMER

A hole in one eh. 

JERRY

Well the-the crowd must have gone wild! 

GEORGE

Ohh yes, yes. Yes Jerry they were all over me. It was like Rocky 1, Hm. Diane came up to me, threw her arms around me... 

KRAMER

(quietly) Um-hm. 

GEORGE

...kissed me. We both had tears streaming down our faces. I never saw anyone so beautiful. It was at that moment that I decided to tell her that, I was not a marine biologist. 

JERRY

Wow! What'd she say? 

GEORGE

Told me to 'Go to hell!' and I took the bus home. 

JERRY

All right lets go. 

ELAINE

What, are you in a bad mood? 

JERRY

Ahhh... got my laundry back. 

ELAINE

Ohhh! Golden Boy? 

JERRY

He didn't make it. 

ELAINE

I'm sorry. (pats him on the arm) 

JERRY

Yea. (pulls at the t-shirt) This is Golden Boy's son... Baby Blue. 

KRAMER

(to George) What's with you? 

GEORGE

Sand. It's everywhere 

KRAMER

Yep. 

AUDREY

Hum! That was really good!  

JERRY

Yeah. are you full?  

AUDREY

Oh no, I've had just enough.  

JERRY

Ah, here we go... apple pie! Best apple pie in the city. (Jerry starts eating) Mmm, delicious. I'm not waiting for you. Take some.  

AUDREY

No thanks.  

JERRY

You're not gonna have any?  

AUDREY

No (with a disgusted face)  

JERRY

Do you not like apple pie?  

AUDREY

No, it's not that.  

JERRY

Well, at least taste it.  

AUDREY

No (a resolute 'no')  

JERRY

You won't even taste it?  

AUDREY

No.  

JERRY

Come on, try it! (Audrey shakes her head doing 'no') A little taste! (still shaking) Come on. (still shaking)  

JERRY

She wouldn't so much as taste it. 

GEORGE

Did she say why?  

JERRY

No. She wouldn't say anything. She just kept shaking her head like this (Imitating Audrey)  

GEORGE

Maybe she's diabetic.  

JERRY

No. She carries Entemanns doughnuts in her purse.  

GEORGE

Maybe you said something that offended her.  

JERRY

The only thing I can think of is I told her we should have those moving walkways all over the city.  

GEORGE

Like at the airport? (getting excited)  

JERRY

Yeah.  

GEORGE

That's a great idea!!!  

JERRY

Tell me about it!  

GEORGE

We could be zipping all over the place.  

JERRY

They could at least try it.  

GEORGE

They never try anything.  

JERRY

What's the harm?  

GEORGE

No harm!  

JERRY

(still talking to George) I'm sorry. There's no reason for her not to taste that pie.  

ELAINE

Who wouldn't taste a pie?  

JERRY

Audrey.  

ELAINE

Dump her.  

JERRY

Boy, I never broke up with anyone for not tasting pie???  

ELAINE

(piffling) I once broke up with someone for not offering me pie.  

JERRY

You did?  

ELAINE

He could be eating a gyro, he wouldn't offer me anything. It's a sickness.  

GEORGE

Well, I can't walk anywhere now. I'm just gonna be wishing there were walkways. (seeing Elaine removing her shoe) What are you doing?  

ELAINE

I got a pebble.  

JERRY

Boy, I never heard of that happening to a woman?  

ELAINE

What the hell does that mean?  

KRAMER

Hey! Elaine. Go Like this. (imitating a mannequin posture)  

ELAINE

What? Why?  

KRAMER

Do it. Do it. This.  

ELAINE

Like... (doing it) Like this?  

KRAMER

Oh yeah! It's you!  

ELAINE

What's me?  

KRAMER

(to the gang) There's a clothing store downtown. They got a mannequin in there that looks exactly like Elaine.  

ELAINE

Get out!  

KRAMER

It's uncanny! It's like they chopped off your arms and legs, dipped you in plastic, and screwed you back all together again, and stuck you on a pedestal. It's really quite exquisite.  

GEORGE

Kramer, what's the name of the store with the mannequin?  

KRAMER

Rinitze. (he takes Jerry's spatula and starts rubbing his back with it) Oh yeah...  

JERRY

(to Kramer) Uh... may I help you? (wondering what the hell's Kramer doing)  

KRAMER

It's this itch. I was watching TV without my shirt on, and one my couch cushions didn't have any fabric on it.  

GEORGE

Wait a minute, Rinitze? Don't they have somme really cool suits in there?  

KRAMER

Real Boss!  

ELAINE

I'm going down there.  

GEORGE

I'm gonna go with you. I gotta get a new suit. I got a second interview with MacKenzie, and I think I'm really close. They're all taking me out to lunch on Friday.  

ELAINE

(grabbing George by the arm, hurried to leave) Let's go.  

GEORGE

All right. All right. (They both leave)  

KRAMER

(leaving too, with the spatula) Are you gonna need this?  

JERRY

Keep it. (implied: please)  

ELAINE

It looks exactly like me.  

GEORGE

It's like some pod landed from another planet and took your body. Don't fall asleep Elaine.  

ELAINE

What's going on here? How do you think this happened?  

GEORGE

Whoa, look at this. This is a beautiful suit. Huh?  

ELAINE

You think that could be a coincidence George? Is that possible?  

SALESWOMAN

(european accent) You are perfect for that suit.  

GEORGE

You think so?  

ELAINE

(to the saleswoman) Excuse me. Where did this come from?  

SALESWOMAN

I don't know.  

GEORGE

You really think this looks O.K. on me?  

SALESWOMAN

Fabulous. Perfect fit. And it's the last one we have.  

ELAINE

I'm sorry. You can't tell me where the mannequin came from?  

SALESWOMAN

I told you, I don't know.  

ELAINE

(irritated, but still polite) Well, is there somebody around here I could talk to who would know?  

SALESWOMAN

Why?  

ELAINE

Isn't it obvious? This mannequin looks exactly like me.  

ELAINE

(upset) Did you just roll your eyes at him? Because let me tell you something, if anobody should be rolling their eyes, it is me at him about you.  

SALESWOMAN

I think maybe you're flattering yourself. That mannquein is wearing a twelve hundred dollar Gaultier dress.  

ELAINE

What are you saying, that I'm not good enough for this hideous dress? (looking at her name tag) Listen Natasha... I wouldn't be caught dead wearing your crummy little euro-trash rags. (to George) I'll meet you outside.  

SALESWOMAN

What is her problem?  

GEORGE

Ah, Pfft! What can you do? (looking at a tag on the suit) Is this the price tag?  

SALESWOMAN

Yes.  

GEORGE

Yes, hello. Party's over. (taking off the suit)  

SALESWOMAN

I'll tell you a little secret. We're having an unadvertised sale starting Friday, that suit will be half-price.  

GEORGE

So you think you can put the suit aside and hold it for me?  

SALESWOMAN

Oh, I'm afraid I could't do that. It wouldn't be fair to the other customers.  

GEORGE

Oh yes, of course, and we have to be fair. (placing the suit further away in the rack)  

ELAINE

So, I found out who supplies the mannequins and I called 'em up.  

KRAMER

Well, how did they get your face?  

ELAINE

I don't know. They wouldn't tell me. (Jerry is not listening, he's looking at two women sitting in the other booth) Jerry? Je... Hello?  

JERRY

(Jerry gets up and walk to these persons) Uh... Excuse me. I couldn't help but notice you offered her a piece of your pie.  

JERRY

And you waved it away.  

JERRY

Did you give her a reason?  

JERRY

You were full. So you gave a reason. You didn't just shake your head.  

JERRY

Exactly. You're not a psycho. You've been very helpful. Thank you very much. Allow me to leave the tip. (sits back with Elaine and Kramer) Well, I think we proven who the psycho is.  

ELAINE

We certainly have.  

KRAMER

Hey, Elaine scratch my back.  

ELAINE

No way!  

KRAMER

Come on, one lap around.  

ELAINE

No.  

KRAMER

It will be a funky adventure.  

ELAINE

Kramer, forget it.  

KRAMER

Jerry, how about you?  

JERRY

I think you know my policy.  

KRAMER

I'm going home to spatula. (picks up the check and walks to the cashier)  

ELAINE

I thought George was meeting us here?  

JERRY

No he's going downtown to guard the suit.  

ELAINE

He's guarding a suit?  

OLIVE

(the cashier; to Kramer) Do you need some help with that itch?  

KRAMER

Madam, I pray you're not toying with me. (Olive shows her long finger nails) Whoa.  

OLIVE

Turn around.  

KRAMER

Oh, all right. (Olive scratches, Kramer enjoys, Elaine and Jerry watch.)  

SALESWOMAN

(makes a guy trying the suit) It fits you perfectly.  

BOB

You think so? (she nods and walks away)  

GEORGE

(outside, looking the guy trying the suit through the window, and thinking out loud) What's this? Can't I leave this place for a second? (goes in, take off his jacket, walks to the guy and talks to him with an european accent) Can I help you?  

BOB

I'm buying the suit.  

GEORGE

No, no, no, this suit is not for sale. (tries to take off the suit from the guy)  

BOB

Excuse me, do you work here?  

GEORGE

(leaving the european accent) No. (laughs) 

BOB

Then what the hell business is it of yours?  

GEORGE

Look, I'm doing you a favor. They're having an unadvertised sale. This suit is gonna be half-priced starting ... Monday.  

BOB

Really?  

GEORGE

Yea Yea Yea 

BOB

This Monday?  

GEORGE

Yes. Now take off those pants.  

SALESWOMAN

Actually, the unadvertised sale starts on Friday.  

BOB

Friday? Thanks. (Gives a dirty look at George and leaves)  

GEORGE

(to the saleswoman) You know honey for an unadvertised sale, you're doing a lot of yapping about it.  

JERRY

I can't beleive your father owns this place. So how are the desserts here?  

AUDREY

Everything is delicious.  

JERRY

You've tasted them?  

AUDREY

Um-hmm, I think almost all of them.  

JERRY

Oh I see they have apple pie.  

AUDREY

Mmm-hmm.  

JERRY

You've had the apple pie?  

AUDREY

Many times.  

JERRY

Audrey, I got to be honest with you. I'm a very curious guy. It's my nature. I need to know things. Not tasting the apple pie the other day, I can't get past it. You obviously like pies. You carry doughnuts in your bag, you're not averse to pastry. Surely you could see how such a thing would prey on my mind.  

AUDREY

Can we drop this?  

JERRY

(like a frustrated child) Why can't I know?  

AUDREY

Ah! Poppie.  

POPPIE

Sweetheart, hello.  

AUDREY

Poppie, this is Jerry.  

POPPIE

Welcome (shakes Jerry's hand)  

JERRY

Hello Poppie.  

POPPIE

Don't fill up on the bread. I'm making you a very special dinner. Very special. (he leaves)  

JERRY

The pies. I'm going to the bathroom. You know. (he leaves)  

POPPIE

Ah, Jerry! Tonight you in for a real treat. I'm personnaly going to prepare the dinner for you and my Audrey.  

AUDREY

Jerry are you OK?  

JERRY

Huh?  

AUDREY

Is anything wrong?  

JERRY

No, Nothing.  

AUDREY

You look like you've seen a ghost.  

OLIVE

(to another cashier) I'll see you tomorrow.  

KRAMER

Hey. These are for you Olive.  

OLIVE

Thank you.  

KRAMER

Ohh!  

POPPIE

Here it is.  

AUDREY

Wait till you taste this. (she eats) Poppie, this is perfect.  

POPPIE

(to Jerry) Well?  

AUDREY

Jerry have some. (Jerry shakes his head doing 'no') You're not gonna taste it? (still shaking) Jerry. (still shaking)  

JERRY

So she tought I did it to get back at her  

GEORGE

Why didn't you just tell her?  

JERRY

I don't think that's the kind of thing you wanna hear about your father. But I'll tell you when he came out of that bathroom and he was kneading that dough, it was a wild scene.  

GEORGE

How could he not have washed?  

JERRY

Even if you're not gonna soap up, at least pretend for my benefit. Turn the water on, do something.  

GEORGE

Yeah, just like I do.  

JERRY

You know a chef who doesn't wash is like a cop who steals. It's a cry for help, he wants to get caught.  

GEORGE

Well, I think Poppie's got some problems. There's a whole other thing going on with Poppie. So how did you leave it?  

JERRY

We haven't spoken.  

KRAMER

Well, I'm not gonna need this anymore. I got Olive. (Jerry throws out the spatula)  

GEORGE

Olive?  

KRAMER

Yeah. My lady friend down at Monks.  

GEORGE

Oh. 

KRAMER

You guys ought to see the way she works her nails across my back. Ohh! She's a maestro. The crisscross. The figure eight, strummin' the ol' banjo, and this wild, savage free-for-all where anything can happen.  

GEORGE

I got to get downtown and buy that suit. The store opens in twenty minutes.  

KRAMER

Is that Elaine mannequin still there?  

GEORGE

Yeah.  

KRAMER

Yeah. 

GEORGE

The last time I saw her, she was naked.  

JERRY

Yeah, and Poppie's got problems...  

BOB

Where is it? Where is it?  

GEORGE

(George takes out the suit from the other rack) Well, look at this. (innocently) This doesn't belong here! Someone has made a terrible mistake.  

BOB

You bastard! You hid the suit.  

GEORGE

Hid? I have no idea how this suit got misplaced. Nevertheless, I do believe I shall purchase it.  

BOB

I hope you rot in that suit. Look I'm gonna get you for this. I don't know how, but I'm gonna get you. You are going to pay!  

GEORGE

Oh, I'll pay. Half-price. Arrivederci my fellow 40-short.  

ELAINE

So I made a little list of people who might've made the mannequin. You know, possible suspects.  

JERRY

Yeah, all right. Go ahead. (not very interested)  

ELAINE

There's this blind guy at a party I was at, and he felt my face for a really long time. You know, to see what I looked like. He almost put his finger up my nose.  

JERRY

(very disinterested) Hum... ok, what else you got?  

ELAINE

OK, I'm not gonna tell you the rest of the list.  

JERRY

Oh, because I didn't think the blind guy did it?  

ELAINE

Because you have an attitude.  

ELAINE

Oh!  

JERRY

Georgio! Nice duds!  

GEORGE

You're telling me. (he walks around and the suit makes a swooshing sound) So, what do you think?  

JERRY

Did you hear something?  

ELAINE

Yeah, like a swoosh.  

JERRY

Yeah.  

ELAINE

(feels the fabric) It must be the fabric. It's rubbing between you thighs when you walk. That's what's making that swooshy sound.  

GEORGE

I probably didn't hear it on the way over because of the street noise. (he panics) This is no good! I got to meet these guys from MacKenzie for lunch in half an hour!  

JERRY

So what? What would they care?  

GEORGE

This MacKenzie, he's a bit of a nut. Someone told me he fired the last guy because his nose whistled when he breathed.  

JERRY

So you think you're not gonna get the job because your pants make a noise?  

GEORGE

Let's say it comes down to me and one other guy. He's got a nice quiet suit, and I'm whooshing all over the place! Who do you think he's gonna hire?  

JERRY

You know, I think all these interviews are making you nuts.  

KRAMER

Hey Jerry, I saw your girlfriend was in here before.  

JERRY

Audrey?  

KRAMER

Yep. Sat down, had herself a piece of pie.  

JERRY

Was it apple?  

KRAMER

What else?  

JERRY

This woman is bending my mind into a pretzel!  

STRANGER

Do I know you?  

ELAINE

Hmm... No you don't.  

STRANGER

Yeah! You were wearing a G-string and one of those bras with points.  

ELAINE

The mannequin!  

JERRY

Oh, I got to see this thing.  

JERRY

Boy, the resemblance is uncanny.  

ELAINE

You think you can pose me however you want? That's my ass in your window!  

SALESWOMAN

It's our store and our mannequin, we can do whatever we want with it.  

ELAINE

No! You take that mannequin down right now, or I'm pressing charges. (Jerry goes along) Yes, this is my attorney.  

SALESWOMAN

(to Jerry) Yeah? What law am I breaking?  

JERRY

Well, I believe there's some legal precedent - Winchell vs. Mahoney,  

ELAINE

Uh-huh  

JERRY

The Charlie Macarthy hearings.  

ELAINE

Uh-huh. Are you taking this down?  

SALESWOMAN

I'm getting the manager. (she leaves)  

ELAINE

Jerry get the car. (she's getting the mannequin)  

JERRY

What are you doing?  

ELAINE

Just get the car!  

JERRY

Elaine, as your legal counsel I must advise against this.  

JERRY

I don't know about you, but I'm getting a hankering for some doublemint gum. Alright, I'm dropping you off at work, right?  

ELAINE

Where are you going?  

JERRY

Poppie's  

MACKENZIE

Thanks for meeting me down here George. My office is out of control, (George's pants are making noise) phones ringing, people running in and out. (MacKenzie stops talking and walking, George too) Did you hear something?  

GEORGE

No, I didn't hear anything.  

MACKENZIE

Huh, that's strange. (they start walking again) It's quieter here. We can concentrate without people wooshing around... (he stops again, George too) That sound again. Sure you didn't hear anything?  

GEORGE

No, can't say as I did.  

MACKENZIE

Kind of like a... rustling.  

GEORGE

Could be the leaves...  

AUDREY

That's right. Poppie's on 77th. Ok we'll see you at 8:00. Bye-bye.  

JERRY

Hello.  

AUDREY

What are you doing here?  

JERRY

So how was the pie?  

AUDREY

What pie?  

JERRY

The apple pie you had today at Monks  

AUDREY

I'm very busy here.  

JERRY

Pretty good, wasn'it? I told you you should've tasted it.  

AUDREY

You better not let Poppie see you here.  

INSPECTOR

All right, I'm looking for someone named Poppie.  

AUDREY

Uh, who are you?  

INSPECTOR

Board of health, we've had several complaints.  

JERRY

Oh, about the... uh (Jerry pretend to wash his hands)  

INSPECTOR

Are you Poppie?  

POPPIE

I'm Poppie.  

INSPECTOR

I think you'd better come with me.  

POPPIE

What's the problem?  

AUDREY

What do they want from Poppie?  

JERRY

Well, Poppie's a little sloppy.  

MACKENZIE

You taught I'd care about your pants wooshing?  

GEORGE

I heard the last guy got fired because his nose whislted.  

MACKENZIE

No, no, no. He got fired because he wasn't a team player. That's something we don't joke about at MacKenzie. You'll find we're team here George. We don't tolerate dissent. If you want to go your own way, you're in the wrong place.  

GEORGE

No problem there. Conformity is an obsession with me.  

WAITER

Chocolate cream pie. Compliments of the house.  

MACKENZIE

Oh! Hope you saved room for dessert.  

WAITER

(to George) The chef said that he made it special for you.  

GEORGE

Oh... (George looks around and sees the chef hiding behind a plant: it's Bob!)  

MACKENZIE

Mmm.. Best pie I've ever tasted. Take a bite George. (George shakes his head doing 'no') Well, take a bite. It's delicious. (still shaking) I insist. (still shaking)  

BUSINESSMAN

If you're one of us, you'll take a bite.  

JERRY

So you didn't get the job.  

GEORGE

No. But I was the only one at the table that didn't get violently ill.  

JERRY

Kramer, you can't keep avoiding her like this, you're gonna have to say something.  

KRAMER

What am I supposed to say?  

JERRY

Tell her you lost your itch.  

GEORGE

What happened to your itch?  

KRAMER

I lost it two days ago. I've been faking it so I wouldn't hurt her feelings.  

JERRY

Well you should tell her.  

KRAMER

I'll let her down easy. All right. (he gets up and walks to Olive) Well, hi Olive. (she reaches for Kramer's back) No, no. No more of that. There's something I have to tell you.  

OLIVE

What?  

KRAMER

Uh, well, there's someone else.  

OLIVE

Someone else?  

KRAMER

Yeah, yeah, yeah...  

OLIVE

Who is she?  

KRAMER

Her. (he points to the Elaine mannequin in Jerry's car)  

OLIVE

her?  

KRAMER

Yeah, there she is. That's my gal.  

OLIVE

You're a liar. I've seen her in here before. She's not your girlfriend.  

KRAMER

Now Olive, look, I'm sorry.  

OLIVE

Why is she wearing her underwear?  

KRAMER

Well, it's the style. (turns back to Jerry) Jerry give me the keys. (Jerry throws his keys to Kramer) Well, I guess we're gonna go for a drive now. She really loves that.  

GEORGE

Did you ever solve the riddle of the pie?  

JERRY

No. That's one for the ages. But I think they're gonna put Poppie away for a long long time.  

ELAINE

You guys are not gonna believe this. I just got a letter from a friend of mine in Chicago who was shopping, and she said she saw a mannequin that looked just like me. What if there're more. Where are they coming from?  

BOSS

Ricky, we've been getting a tremendous response to your TR-6 mannequin.  

RICKY

TR-6? I prefer to think of her as... Elaine.  

GEORGE

It's just not good, it's not good. 

JERRY

It's not good. 

GEORGE

I'm bored. She's boring, I'm boring, we're both boring. We got out to eat, we both read newspapers. 

JERRY

Well at breakfast everybody reads. 

GEORGE

No. Lunch we read, dinner we read. 

JERRY

You read during lunch? 

GEORGE

Ya 

JERRY

Oh, well. 

GEORGE

There's nothing to talk about. 

JERRY

Ya, what's there to talk about. 

GEORGE

Well at least you and I are talking about how there's nothing to talk about. 

JERRY

Why don't you talk to her about how there's nothing to talk about? 

GEORGE

She knows there is nothing to talk about. 

JERRY

At least you'll be talking. 

GEORGE

Oh shut up. 

AL

Hey, look who's here. 

JERRY

Hey, Al. 

GEORGE

Hey, Al. How's it going? 

AL

(extremely happy) Deeply in love. We have soo many things to talk about. Sometimes we'll talk all night, till the sun comes up (pauses in his happiness; to George) so how about you? 

GEORGE

Oh I'm seeing someone, yes. You know her, Daphne Bower. 

AL

Great girl. 

GEORGE

We have no need to speak. We communicate with deep soulful looks. 

JERRY

Like Dwight and Mamie Eisenhower. 

AL

(to Jerry) Oh did you hear about Fulton? 

JERRY

Ya. 

AL

I went by the hospital to see him a few days ago (looking at Jerry) think he'd really like you to come visit. 

JERRY

Me? 

AL

Ya, he said he could use a good laugh. 

GEORGE

What about me? 

AL

(to George) He didn't mention you. (Looks toward the front of the bus) This is my stop. Uh see ya. 

GEORGE

Ya 

JERRY

Ya, see ya. 

GEORGE

Deeply in love. If you can't say anything bad about a relationship, you shouldn't say anything at all. 

JERRY

(points to George) Ya. 

GEORGE

I didn't even know Fulton was in the hospital. 

JERRY

Could use a good laugh. You know what kind of pressure that is? Come on, come with me. 

GEORGE

Na no, I'm not good in these situations. I can't hide my pity. I..I make em feel worse. 

JERRY

Oh, stop it. 

GEORGE

Ya and also I'm afraid that people in that state are finally going to tell me what they really think of me. You know they got nothing to lose what do they care? 

JERRY

So you're not gonna come? 

GEORGE

No but say hello for me. 

KRAMER

Hey! 

JERRY

Hey! Hey Mick. 

MICKEY

Hey Jerry. 

KRAMER

What's doing? 

JERRY

Nothing, what's doing with you? 

KRAMER

Same old, same old. 

JERRY

George this is Mickey. 

GEORGE

Hi, nice to meet you. 

MICKEY

Pleasure. 

JERRY

How's work going you guys? 

MICKEY

Lets not even talk about it. 

GEORGE

(to Kramer) You got a job? 

KRAMER

Ya, Mickey. He hooked me up. We're stand-ins for the actors on 'All My Children.' Mickey, he's a stand-in for an eight year old kid and I stand in for the kids father. 

MICKEY

(to Jerry then both Jerry and George) But I got a big problem. The kid I stand in for, he's growing. He was four feet last month, now he's like four-two and a half. He shot up two and a half inches. I can do four-two, four-three is a stretch, any higher than that and I'm gonna be out on my ass doing that para-legal crap. 

JERRY

How do you stop a kid from growing? 

KRAMER

(to Mickey) I told you, you should offer him some cigarettes. 

MICKEY

I offered him cigarettes, (to Jerry and George) but his stupid mother is hanging around. She won't let him have any. 

KRAMER

(to Mickey) What about lifts? 

MICKEY

(to Kramer) Out of the question. 

GEORGE

(to Mickey) Can't you just switch with another Midget? 

MICKEY

(turns and moves up to George, points his finger at him) It's little people, you got that? 

KRAMER

Easy Mickey, easy. 

GEORGE

Yap.. 

KRAMER

Alright we gotta get back to the show. What are you guys doing? 

JERRY

I'm going to the hospital, to visit Fulton. 

KRAMER

(on his way to the door) Oh, oh well say hello for me. 

KRAMER

Now look, we're going to stop at the shoe maker right now. You gotta get some lifts for your shoes. 

MICKEY

Lifts?! Look Kramer you don't understand, this kind of thing is just not done. 

KRAMER

You wanna keep your job don't you? 

MICKEY

Ya but.. 

KRAMER

YAH! No Buts 

MICKEY

Kramer 

KRAMER

(with his hand in Mickey's face) YAAAAAH! 

JERRY

Hey, woahoh Fulton. It's me. 

FULTON

Hey Jerry, good to see ya. I could really use a good laugh. 

JERRY

Who couldn't. 

FULTON

I haven't cracked a smile in months. 

JERRY

Oh don't worry, you'll crack. Cracking's inevitable, first you crack then you chuckle. That was the motto with the Russians at the Caesar Leningrad... first you crack then you chuckle. (Fulton looks at him not amused) You know because Leningrad when the Nazis attacked, it wasn't a very happy time... because of the war, famine, plus it was cold, very cold... they were eating each other. (Nervous under the pressure; Fulton not finding anything Jerry is saying funny) Maybe this isn't a good time for a visit. 

FULTON

It's a fine time. 

JERRY

Oh, alright ah well... There's a priest, a minister and a rabbi, and they're all staring at him.... 

GEORGE

(sets down his paper) So how were the eggs? 

DAPHNE

Eggs are eggs. 

GEORGE

(Not amused with her answer) Eggs are eggs. That is very profound. (laughs; Daphne goes back to reading her paper) By the same token you could say fish is fish. Ha ha ha, I don't think so. (pauses) Listen Dophne 

DAPHNE

(correcting George) Daphne. 

GEORGE

Daphne. I have to tell you something, this is very difficult... 

DAPHNE

(interrupts and hurriedly puts down her paper) Oh, I forgot to tell you. Al Netchie called me today. 

GEORGE

Ya, ya. I bumped into him on the bus. What did he have to say? 

DAPHNE

He told me not to get involved with you. 

GEORGE

What? 

DAPHNE

Ya, he said you could never make a commitment to any one and you'd just wind up (reaches out and lightly slaps George's hand) hurting me. 

GEORGE

He said that? (Daphne shacks her head) What a nerve. How dare he say something like that. 

DAPHNE

Is it true? 

GEORGE

Of course not. I mean sure, there may have been one or two occasions in the past, when I may have reacted in uh impulsive or somewhat immature manner, but those days are well behind me. 

SON

How long are you going to be away for Daddy? 

FATHER

I'm not really going away, I told you, I'll be back every other weekend. 

SON

Don't go Daddy, don't go. 

FATHER

Now Porter, you know your mother and I love you very much, but sometimes people fall out of love. Now give me a big hug. 

DIRECTOR

(walks into the scene) ...and there's your scene. Stand-ins 

KRAMER

Yo 

HAND

Alright you guys get on their spots so we can fix the lights. 

KRAMER

(taps the Father on the shoulder) That's good work. 

MICKEY

(quickly with no acting) How long you going to be away for Daddy? 

KRAMER

(trying to act like the guy playing the Father) I'm not really going away, I told you I'd be back every other weekend. 

MICKEY

(tugs on Kramer's coat) Don't go Daddy, don't...go. 

KRAMER

Now listen Porter, you know your mother and I love you very much. But sometimes people fall out of love. Now give me a big hug. 

MICKEY

Ah! (pauses for the hug) Alright (Kramer still holding on) Alright! Kramer! (pushes Kramer off him) 

DIRECTOR

Ok everybody that's lunch... one hour. 

KRAMER

How do those lifts feel? 

MICKEY

Quiet. 

TAMMY

Hi guys. 

MICKEY

Hey Tammy. 

TAMMY

Hey, you look different. Have you been working out? 

MICKEY

(looks at Kramer) Not that I know of. 

TAMMY

Well whatever it is you're doing, keep doing it you look great. 

MICKEY

How about lunch? 

TAMMY

OH I can't today, but um I see it our future. (starts to leave) See ya Kramer. 

KRAMER

Ya. 

TAMMY

Bye Mickey 

KRAMER

Ooo she likes you buddy (they to a high five hand shake) 

MICKEY

Ya! 

MICKEY

All of a sudden. 

KRAMER

What? 

JOHNNY

Hey Mick. 

MICKEY

How you doin' Johnny? 

JOHNNY

What gives...what's going on? Goin' out with Tammy? 

MICKEY

Maybe. What's it to you? 

JOHNNY

Somethin different about you. 

MICKEY

I got my hair cut that's all (turns to look at Kramer) 

JOHNNY

Nah, that's not it. Something else... Ya you look different. 

MICKEY

You don't, you got the same ugly mug since the day I met ya. 

JOHNNY

I don't know what it is, but I'll find out. (walking away) I'll find out. 

JERRY

..so uh she's just sitting there and a uh Packyderm, you remember the derm. He says uh, I'm gonna go up to her. So we uh he uh picks up the two pieces of (wipes his brow) pizza and uh the uh and then they're steaming hot and they're burning his hands see so he... he's juggling em (does juggling motions) he's jugglin em, jus throwing them up in the air and just as he gets up to her down they go. (Swallows and takes a breath) Well we all just lost it. (Fulton not laughing, stone faced) It was really really funny. 

PHIL

Hey Jerry. 

JERRY

Hey Phil how you doing? 

PHIL

You look terrific. 

JERRY

I got my health. 

PHIL

Well, that's the most important thing. (to Fulton) Hey how ya doing Fulton! Octane, Butane, Nitrane! (Fulton looks at him still stone faced and not amused. To Jerry) How's he doing? 

JERRY

(wiping his brow) He could use a couple laughs. 

ELAINE

You should have told that story about Packyderm dropping the pizza. 

JERRY

I told it. (Answers the buzzer) Ya? 

GEORGE

(on the speaker) Ya 

JERRY

Ya. (hits the button, opens the door. To Elaine) Hey you know what as I was leaving I bumped into Phil Titola. He is one of the greatest guys. 

ELAINE

Do I know him? 

JERRY

No, but I'll tell you something. Of all the guys I know, I could envision you going out with him. 

ELAINE

If you were a woman would you go out with him? 

JERRY

If I was a woman I'd be down at the dock waiting for the fleet to come in. 

ELAINE

(laughs) Ya, I bet you would. Alright, give him my number. 

JERRY

Alright. 

GEORGE

This you are not going to believe. Al Netchie, that pimple. Tells Daphne, not get this 'Not to get involved with me.' 

JERRY

What? 

GEORGE

Ya. That's what she told me. 

ELAINE

Why? 

GEORGE

Because he's afraid she's gonna get hurt. 

ELAINE

Is she? 

GEORGE

Of course. 

ELAINE

So? 

GEORGE

Wa.. He doesn't have to tell her. 

ELAINE

Maybe he likes her. 

GEORGE

Oh no no no. He's deeply in love, and I was just about to break up with her when she told me. 

JERRY

So what are you gonna do? 

GEORGE

Well I can't break up with her now. 

JERRY

Why? 

GEORGE

Because he said I was going to. 

ELAINE

So now you're going to keep going out with her, for spite? 

GEORGE

Yes, I am. 

JERRY

Ya, I could see that. 

GEORGE

I don't see any way around it. 

JERRY

No, me either. 

GEORGE

What choice do I have? 

JERRY

None. 

JERRY

Fulton's wife told me it's all my fault. She said since my visit he's taken a turn for the worse. 

KRAMER

Did you tell him the Packyderm story? 

JERRY

(yelling) Yes I told him the Packyderm story! 

KRAMER

Maybe I outta go over there. 

JERRY

Towards what end? 

KRAMER

I'm very good with sick people. They love me. When my friend Len Nicodemo had the gout, I moved into his hospital room for three days, the doctors were amazed at his recovery. 

KRAMER

Hey. 

JERRY

Hey Mick. 

MICKEY

(to Kramer) Johnny Vigiano went through my locker. 

KRAMER

YAOH! 

MICKEY

(slamming the door) That little Bastard! He saw the lifts in my shoes. He knows I'm heightening. (to Kramer) This never would have happened if you hadn't pushed me to get those things. I told you. 

KRAMER

Hey, nobody put a gun to your head. 

MICKEY

Ya well just keep out of my business you big ape. (pushes Kramer) 

KRAMER

Who you calling big ape? (pushes Mickey back) 

MICKEY

You (grabs Kramer) 

JERRY

(starts pulling them apart) Alright break it up, break it up. Come on, just cut it out now (Kramer yells) 

KRAMER

(pacing back and forth) Ya. 

MICKEY

I'm sorry Kramer. 

KRAMER

No no it's alright, it's alright. You're stressed Oout! 

JERRY

(to Mickey) Why does this guy Johnny have it in for you? 

MICKEY

Oh, he's always been jealous of me. I always get to stand in for the bigger stars; The Cosby Kids, Ricky Schroder, Macaulay Culkin. 

KRAMER

(whistles) What's he like huh? 

MICKEY

He's a good kid. 

KRAMER

Ya? 

JERRY

So what does he care if you put lifts in? 

MICKEY

You don't understand. There's an unwritten code about this kind of thing. I could be ostracized. I remember when I was a kid, some guy tried to heighten. He lost his job, lost his friends, Everything. Oh, I knew I was crazy to try this kind of thing, but I was so desperate. (pauses laying on the couch; jumps up) What is this kid taking anyway? Hormones? Steroids? Would you tell me!? 

DAPHNE

George, tomorrow's Sunday. We could sleep late, and get the paper and half breakfast and spend the morning together, go for a long walk, maybe do a little shopping, have lunch... 

GEORGE

(interrupts her) You know what. I don't think I'm going to be able to stay over tonight. 

DAPHNE

Why not? 

GEORGE

I, I really should go home. Ya.. actually I'm planning on spending the day with my father tomorrow (short laugh) we're uh we're going to a father-son picnic, just the two of us. 

DAPHNE

I thought we were going to spend the day together. 

GEORGE

Well Dad's been planning this for such a long time, he bought a new blanket, and he got tha...that game with foam paddles and the velcro ball. (laughs) 

DAPHNE

Have you given any more thought to what we talked about? You know, moving in? 

GEORGE

Yes, oh yes very much. 

DAPHNE

Maybe you don't want to move in. 

GEORGE

No, no I do. You know it's just... 

DAPHNE

(interrupting him) Maybe Al Netchie was right, maybe I shouldn't have gotten involved with you. 

GEORGE

(angry that she believes Al was right) No he's not right. Al Netchie is not right! Alright I'm canceling the father-son picnic. I don't know what he's gonna do with all that potato salad. 

ELAINE

(Phil cracking up) So then Packyderm picks up the pieces of pizza, and mind you know they are burning hot.. he can bearly hold 'em. I mean he's like trying to juggle (does a juggling motion and begins laughing) the pizza, you know ah. And then they go flying out of... 

PHIL

(dying of laughter) I'm peeing in my pants. 

ELAINE

(cont.) they go flying out of his hands, and one lands on her face and the other lands on his face. (pause as they both continue to laugh really hard) and the whole place went crazy. 

PHIL

Oh, I'm sorry, Oh. What a story. 

ELAINE

I know, I know, I was unbelievable 

PHIL

Oh that is one of the funniest stories I've ever heard. 

ELAINE

(wipes her eyes because she laughed so hard she cried) I know. 

PHIL

Well this has been one hell of a night. 

ELAINE

Oh, I'm sorry Jerry didn't suggest this sooner. 

PHIL

You know, you really are beautiful Elaine. 

ELAINE

Oh, well, (pauses) Good night. 

PHIL

Good night? 

ELAINE

Well (leans in to kiss Phil, then looks down at his pants with a awkward look on her face) 

JERRY

(on phone) Come on Adrian give me another chance, I know I could cheer Fulton up. I'll tell you what, I'll do my act (pauses for response from Adrian) No new material (Elaine enters) He's never heard it. He'll love it, I just did it at the Concord last week, it killed. (waves hello to Elaine; pauses for response from Adrian) Thank you, thanks fo.. you will not regret this. Ok, Bye. (hangs up phone; to Elaine) Hey. 

ELAINE

Hello. 

JERRY

So? 

ELAINE

What? 

JERRY

Come on. How was your date? 

ELAINE

Oh, the date. The date. 

JERRY

Ya how was it? 

ELAINE

Interesting. 

JERRY

Really. 

ELAINE

Oh ya. 

JERRY

Why what happened? 

ELAINE

Let's see, (thinking) how shall I put this. 

JERRY

Just put it. 

ELAINE

He took it out. 

JERRY

(confused) He what? 

ELAINE

He took (blows on her glasses twice to clean them) it out. 

JERRY

He took what out? 

ELAINE

It. 

JERRY

He took It, Out? 

ELAINE

Yessiree Bob. 

JERRY

He couldn't. 

ELAINE

He did. 

JERRY

(motions of making out) Well you were involved in some sort of amorous... 

ELAINE

Noooo. 

JERRY

You mean he just 

ELAINE

Yes. 

JERRY

Are you sure? 

ELAINE

Oh quite. 

JERRY

There was no mistaking it? 

ELAINE

(looks straight into his eyes) Jerry. 

JERRY

So you were talking, (Elaine makes an agreement sound 'mmm') you're having pleasant conversation, (Elaine makes an agreement sound 'mmm') then all of sudden... 

ELAINE

Yea. 

JERRY

It. 

ELAINE

It. 

JERRY

Out. 

ELAINE

Out. 

JERRY

Well I, I can't believe this. I know Phil, he, he's a good friend of mine. We play softball together. How could this be? 

ELAINE

Oh it be. (sarcastically) You got any other friends you want to set me up with? 

KRAMER

Hey. (to Elaine) Hey how was your date with Phil Titola? 

ELAINE

(to Kramer) He took it out. 

KRAMER

Maybe uh, it needed some air. You know sometimes they need air, they can't breathe in there. It's in human. 

GEORGE

So she's just sitting there, she's having a pleasant conversation... and all of a sudden. 

JERRY

It. 

GEORGE

It. 

JERRY

Out. 

GEORGE

Out. (Jerry shakes his head in agreement) Wow. I spend so much time trying to get their clothes off, I never thought of taking mine off. (Jerry nods; George looks at his watch) Alright, Hey come on, get out of here, Dophne gonna be here any minute. 

JERRY

Alright I'm going. 

GEORGE

You know what I've come to realize? I'm not just bored. I genuinely dislike her. 

JERRY

Well how long you are going to keep this up? 

GEORGE

Hey I'll get married if I have to. Al Netchie will think twice before he opens his mouth about me again. 

JERRY

You know George they are doing wonderful things at mental institutions these days. I'd be happy to set-up a meet and greet. 

GEORGE

I'm very disappointed to here you talk like that. You still don't know what makes me tick. 

JERRY

Yes I do. 

GEORGE

What are you doing? 

JERRY

I'm going to the hospital to see Fulton. I'm not even saying hello, I'm going right into material. 

PHIL

Ah hey Jer. 

JERRY

Oh hey Phil. 

PHIL

You know I'm sorry things didn't work out with Elaine. I don't know what I did wrong. 

JERRY

Well, y..you showed her who you are. 

PHIL

Oh, look at this, what she's got to breast feed in public. 

JERRY

Ya, that's the.. last thing you want to see. Well, next to last. 

PHIL

I'll see ya. 

JERRY

Ya take it easy. 

JERRY

(acting like he was walking on stage) Hey how ya doing? Good to be here. 

MICKEY

Rock, paper, scissors match. 

MICKEY

Alright, rock beats paper. 

KRAMER

I thought paper covered rock? 

MICKEY

Nah, rock flies right through paper. 

KRAMER

What beats rock? 

MICKEY

(looks at his hand) Nothing beats rock. 

KRAMER

Alright come on. 

MICKEY

Rock, paper, scissors match. 

KRAMER

Rock. 

MICKEY

Rock 

MICKEY

Rock, paper, scissors match. 

KRAMER

Rock. 

MICKEY

Rock. 

MICKEY

Hey Bob. What's with you? You gotta problem? (to Kramer) You see that look he gave me? (starts to get up to go after him) 

KRAMER

(stops Mickey) Alright, come on. 

MICKEY

Rock, paper, scissors match. 

KRAMER

Rock. 

MICKEY

Rock. 

MICKEY

Hey Tammy. 

TAMMY

Hello. 

MICKEY

So Tammy, finally, today's our big lunch. 

TAMMY

I don't think so. 

MICKEY

Why not? What the hell are you talking about? 

TAMMY

Look Mickey, everybody knows that you're heightening. It's all over the set. 

MICKEY

Wait, wait (goes to grab her arm) 

TAMMY

(recoils) Don't touch me. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. All the progress we made over the years and you go and blow it by pulling a stupid stunt like this. 

MICKEY

Wait a second, wait a second, you got me all wrong. It was all because of the kid. (numerous little people begin to crowd around them) (to Tammy) The kid was growing. He shot up two and a half inches in a month. (to all the little people) I woulda lost my job. Any one of you would have done the same. You got no right! I'm Mickey Abbott! I stood in for Punky Bruster when all of you was nothing. (seeing the crowd still doesn't agree with what he did, he points at Kramer) It's all his fault. (Kramer acts like he doesn't know what Mickey is talking about) It was his idea. 

TAMMY

Come on Johnny, let's go get something to eat. 

MICKEY

(in complete disgust as seeing Tammy leave with Johnny) AH! (turns and looks at Kramer) AH! 

KRAMER

What? 

MICKEY

AH! 

KRAMER

Mickey! 

JERRY

This guy's belching out vitamins.. 

FULTON

(dying of laughter and coughing) Stop. 

JERRY

(cont) and this whole justice league, Batman, Green Lantern, Wonder Woman. You mean to tell me Superman can't cover everything? 

FULTON

(still laughing and coughing) Stop. 

JERRY

For crying out loud, He's Superman. (Fulton stops laughing, Jerry's face is stunned) Fulton? (looks at him) Fulton? 

DAPHNE

George, first let me just say I've never been with a guy who was so committed to commit. I mean it's so rare in men these days an, that's what makes this all the more difficult. 

GEORGE

(happily) Difficult? 

DAPHNE

The other day after work some girlfriends and I went to a bar for some drinks and there was this crazy mishap and I wound up meeting someone as a result. George... 

GEORGE

(acting disappointed) Oh, please don't. 

DAPHNE

Uh, I'm sorry. I'm afraid the worst of it is it's someone you know. Jerry Persheck. 

GEORGE

Packyderm? 

DAPHNE

Heh, he was carrying these two pieces of pizza... 

MERYL

Good morning. 

JERRY

Good morning. 

MERYL

How'd you sleep? 

JERRY

Hey, you are the couch tonight, young lady. You were all over my side. 

MERYL

I was not! 

JERRY

C'mon, I was sleeping with one cheek off the bed! 

MERYL

By the way, you know you're falling way behind on the 'I love you's.' 

JERRY

No, no, 12-8! 

MERYL

No, it's 15-8. 

JERRY

I know I can't beat ya, I'm just trying to stay competitive. 

MERYL

Alright c'mon, let's get some breakfast. 

JERRY

Uh, let me get a coat. I think I'll uh try a sport jacket and scarf thing, you know, like an unemployed actor. (Goes into his room, and comes back out with the jacket on.) Ahh, haven't worn this one in a long time. 

MERYL

Ooh, cashmere? 

JERRY

No, gore-tex. It's new. (Checks his pockets.) Hey, look at this locket. What the hell is this? There's a picture in here, look at that. 

MERYL

Wow, this is really old. You don't know whose it is? 

JERRY

No, I haven't worn this jacket since I got it back from the dry-cleaner. Maybe we should ask him. 

MERYL

Alright, we'll stop over there. 

JERRY

Yeah. What do you want to get for breakfast? 

MERYL

Pancakes. 

JERRY

Oh now, c'mon, you know I'm getting pancakes. 

MERYL

I don't know that! 

JERRY

But we can't both get pancakes, it's embarrassing. It's like one step from the couples who dress alike. 

MERYL

I'll get the short stack. 

JERRY

Ah, that's why I love ya. 15-9. (They go out into the hallway and run into Kramer and his African-American girlfriend, Anna.) Hey, how ya doin.' 

KRAMER

We just got back from breakfast. The pancakes were dynamite. 

JERRY

Hey, is that my maple syrup? Oh, ya. (Kramer hands it over.) 

MERYL

You bring your own syrup? 

KRAMER

Got to. 

JERRY

You got a lot to learn about pancakes. 

MARTY

This is my wife. She died eight years ago. I been looking all over for this! 

JERRY

Boy, it's a lucky thing I put the jacket on. But how did it get in the pocket? 

MARTY

Well, see here, the chain is broken...it must have slipped in when I was, uh...(gestures at the racks of clothes behind him.) 

JERRY

Oh, wow. 

MARTY

I turned my house upside-down looking for this! It's all I have left of her. 

MERYL

Oh, that's so touching. 

MARTY

Know what I'm gonna do for you? I'm gonna give you and your family 25% off all your dry-cleaning from now on. 

JERRY

Oh, come on! 

MARTY

What are you talkin' about? 

JERRY

It's silly! 

MARTY

Hey, forget it! 

JERRY

Get outta here! 

MARTY

It's done! 

JERRY

Alright. 

MERYL

Well, I guess I get it too, because I'm his wife. 

MARTY

I didn't know you were married. 

JERRY

Oh...yeah...uh you've never met my wife, Meryl? Meryl Seinfeld. 

MARTY

Sure, you get the discount, too. 

JERRY

You might regret that, because the money my wife spends on clothes... 

MERYL

I'm taking him to the cleaners! 

JERRY

Ah - see the sense of humor? C'mere, I'm so nuts about you...(hugs Meryl.) I tell ya, it was fun being single, but when you meet a woman like this, you don't walk to get married - you run! 

ELAINE

Oh, hi Greg. 

GREG

Haven't seen you in a while. 

ELAINE

Yeah. Well, actuall today was the first day I worked out since the Central Park Mini-Marathon. 

GREG

You ran the Mini-Marathon? 

ELAINE

No, but I exercised that day. (Laughs.) 

GREG

Well, I-I gotta take off. 

ELAINE

Yeah, I guess as an airline pilot, you're one of the few people who can say that and mean it. (Laughs again. Greg looks at her, unamused.) Um, do you have the time? 

GREG

Eleven-thirty. 

ELAINE

Eleven-thirty? 

GREG

Wait-wait, ten-thirty. Sorry. 

ELAINE

Oh. 

GREG

Do you have to be somewhere? 

ELAINE

No. 

GREG

Then what are you doing? 

ELAINE

I'm just waiting for my friend George, we worked out together. 

GREG

Oh. Well, it was good seeing you. 

ELAINE

Yeah, nice to see you, too. 

MERYL

Uh, would you, um...can I... 

JERRY

Pardon? 

MERYL

The syrup. Would you pass the syrup? 

JERRY

Oh, you want to try the syrup! (Meryl smiles and takes it. The waitress comes over.) 

WAITRESS

Can I get you anything else? 

JERRY

Um, yeah...I think my wife and I'll have a little more coffee. 

WAITRESS

Okay. 

MERYL

And a check for my husband. 

JERRY

To my beautiful wife. 

MERYL

To my adoring husband. 

JERRY

Adoring? What about handsome? 

MERYL

I like adoring. 

JERRY

Ya sure, adoring's good for you, what does it do for me? (Meryl laughs. The owner of the coffee shop comes over.) 

OWNER

Excuse me...where did you get that? 

JERRY

I, uh...well... 

OWNER

Uh, we don't allow any outside syrups, jams or condiments in the restaurant. (To Jerry) And if I catch you in here with that again...I will confiscate it. 

JERRY

Well, I-I-I told my wife not to bring it. 

KRAMER

Really? 25% off? Do I get that, too? 

JERRY

No, just Meryl. 

KRAMER

Why, why? Why does she get it? 

JERRY

Because she's my wife! (The door buzzer sounds; Jerry answers it) Yeh? 

ELAINE

(on buzzer) Meh. 

JERRY

(buzzes her up) Eh. (to Kramer) You know and I'll tell ya, I'm really enjoying this marriage thing. You think about each other. You care about each other. It's wonderful! Plus, I love saying 'my wife.' Once I started saying it, I couldn't stop - 'my wife' this, 'my wife' that...it's an amazing way to begin a sentence. 

KRAMER

'My wife has an inner ear infection.' 

JERRY

See? 

KRAMER

I like that! Hey look, will you do me a favor? Will you take my quilt into the cleaners for me, so I can get the discount too? 

JERRY

Oh come on, we're gonna start doing this now? I can't be taking all your dry-cleaning in! 

KRAMER

C'mon, just this one time! It's expensive! 

JERRY

Alright. (Elaine enters.) 

KRAMER

Hey. Hey Elaine, what do you say if neither of us is married in ten years, we get hitched? 

ELAINE

Let's make it fifty. 

KRAMER

We're engaged! Alright, I'm gonna get my quilt. (Kramer leaves.) 

ELAINE

Alright, listen to this. Remember that guy I was telling you about at the health club? 

JERRY

The fly-boy. 

ELAINE

Yeah. 

JERRY

Hey, where's George? I thought he was with you. 

ELAINE

I waited, he didn't show up. Anyway, this guy gave me an open-lip kiss. 

JERRY

Hmm, So? 

ELAINE

So? We've always just kind've pecked. This one had a totally different dynamic. 

JERRY

Really. 

ELAINE

Yeah. I mean, his upper lip landed flush on my upper lip. But his lower lip landed well below my rim. 

JERRY

Ohhh, moisture? 

ELAINE

Yeah. Definite moisture. 

JERRY

That's an open-lip kiss, alright. 

ELAINE

Yeah. Listen, I think he's giving me a big signal...maybe he wants to change our relationship. (The buzzer sounds, Elaine answers it.) Yeah? 

GEORGE

Oh, uh...it's George. 

ELAINE

Hey, what happened to you? 

GEORGE

Nothing...little problem. 

ELAINE

Well, what was it? I mean, I was waiting. 

GEORGE

Can I come upstairs, please? (Elaine pushes the button and lets George in.) 

ELAINE

I mean, maybe he wants to ask me out. 

JERRY

I don't know why you're interested in this guy, he's a jerk. 

ELAINE

Because, he doesn't pay any attention to me, and uh he ignores me. 

JERRY

Yeah, so? 

ELAINE

I respect that. (George enters.) Mmm, what happened? 

GEORGE

Nothing, I... said it was a little problem. 

ELAINE

Yeah? What was it? 

GEORGE

Well...I was in the locker room showering, and I...I had to go, so... 

JERRY

Here we go. 

GEORGE

Anyway, I think the guy in the shower opposite saw me. He gave me a dirty look. 

ELAINE

You went...in the shower? 

GEORGE

Yeah, so what? I'm not the only one! (Kramer enters with his quilt.) 

ELAINE

Do you go in the shower? 

JERRY

No, never. 

ELAINE

Do you? 

KRAMER

I take baths. 

GEORGE

Well, what was I supposed to do? Get out of the shower, put on my bathrobe? Go all the way down to the other end? Come all the way back? 

ELAINE

Did you ever hear of...holding it in? 

GEORGE

Oh, no...no, that's very bad for the kidneys. 

ELAINE

How do you know? 

GEORGE

Medical journals! 

JERRY

Do the medical journals mention anything about standing in a pool of someone else's urine? 

JERRY

Hello. 

MERYL

Oh, hi...honey. 

JERRY

What are you doing here? 

MERYL

I just thought I'd drop off a few things. 

JERRY

Oh. (Smiles at Marty nervously.) Well, I must have been in the incinerator room when you left. Here you go, Marty. (Hands over Kramer's quilt.) 

MARTY

Another quilt? Huh? (Uncle Leo enters.) 

LEO

Jerry! 

JERRY

Uncle Leo?! 

LEO

Hello! 

JERRY

Hello. 

MARTY

So, if you or your wife want to drop by on Wednesday, it should be ready. 

LEO

Your wife? 

JERRY

Yeah...my wife. 

LEO

What are you talking about? 

JERRY

Uh...I got married. 

LEO

You got married? I wasn't invited? Nobody sends me an invitation? 

JERRY

Well, it was sudden. 

LEO

Are you ashamed of your uncle? Do I embarrass you? 

JERRY

No, no, it was a small ceremony. 

LEO

Haven't I always been a good uncle? 

JERRY

Yes, yes, you have. 

LEO

Who told you when you went to school that you print well? 

JERRY

You did, you did. 

LEO

When he was younger, he had a beautiful penmanship. I used to encourage him to print. 

JERRY

I'm a good printer. 

LEO

I remember your 'V.' It was like a perfect triangle. Whoa, there's my bus! (Rushes out.) Hello! Wait! 

JERRY

Uncle Leo, wait! 

GREG

I'm glad you're here. This can get really boring. Do you know where I can get some good olives? 

ELAINE

I can find out. 

GREG

Would ya? 

ELAINE

Sure. (thinking) Ooh, a project. That's a definite signal. 

GREG

By the way, you look really great in that leotard. 

ELAINE

Oh, thanks. (thinking) That's no signal, who wouldn't like me in this leotard? I look amazing in this leotard. 

GREG

Hey, you know what's weird? I think I had a dream about you last night. 

ELAINE

(thinking) Okay, he open-lips me, he dreams about me, we have an olive project...that's it, I'm asking this guy out. (to Greg) Um, you know Greg, I... 

GREG

Can I have a sip of your water? 

ELAINE

Oh, yeah, sure. (Hands Greg her bottle.) 

GREG

Thanks. (Is about to take a drink, but wipes the neck of the bottle with his shirt first.) 

ELAINE

(shocked expression; thinking) Oh my God. 

GREG

I'm sorry, what were you saying? 

ELAINE

Oh, it was nothing, for-forget it. (George enters the gym.) 

GREG

See that guy right there? 

ELAINE

Yup, you mean him? 

GREG

I caught him urinating in the shower. I'm thinking about turning him in, too. 

MERYL

Honey? Could you get me something to drink? 

JERRY

You're right there. 

MERYL

C'mon, I'm sitting! (Jerry walks to the kitchen, annoyed. Meryl laughs at the TV show she's watching.) 

JERRY

Honey, what'd you do with the can opener? 

MERYL

I didn't do anything with it. 

JERRY

Well, it's not here, it was here yesterday. 

MERYL

It's in the first drawer. 

JERRY

I'm looking in the first drawer. It's not here. 

MERYL

Yes, it is. 

JERRY

Hey...I'm not stupid. I'm looking in that drawer, there's no can opener. 

MERYL

Did I say you were stupid? 

JERRY

Well, wouldn't I have to be? You tell me there's a can opener in the drawer, I'm looking in the drawer, there's no can opener - what other conclusion could one reach? (The phone rings.) 

MERYL

Do you want me to go find it? 

JERRY

Yes. I do. You show me where there's a can opener in that drawer. (Answers the phone.) Hello! I'm sorry, I'm just fighting with my wife. 

HELEN

Jerry, we just heard, what's going on? 

MORTY

Why the hell didn't you tell us? 

JERRY

Listen, Ma... 

MERYL

It was in here yesterday! 

JERRY

Yeah, that's what I said! 

HELEN

Who is she? When did this happen? 

MORTY

I told her you'd get married. She thought you'd never do it. 

HELEN

Morty, you're talking too loud. 

MORTY

I'm not talking loud! 

HELEN

You're hurting my eardrum. 

MERYL

Well, you must have done something with it! 

JERRY

I'm on the phone! 

HELEN

Is she there? Can we talk to her? What's her name? 

JERRY

Mom, I'm not married. 

HELEN

What? 

JERRY

I'm not married! 

MORTY

I knew it, I told you! 

HELEN

Uncle Leo said. 

JERRY

I'm just pretending I'm married to get a discount on dry-cleaning. 

HELEN

A discount on dry-cleaning? 

JERRY

Could you make a little more noise? (To his parents) Listen, I'm gonna have to call you later. 

MERYL

Well, I give up. 

JERRY

Well, whoopie whoop. (Meryl goes into the other room. Kramer staggers in the door in his bathrobe.) 

KRAMER

Got any coffee? 

JERRY

Yeah. (Kramer lurches into the kitchen, trips, and falls onto the kitchen floor.) I'll get it, I'll get it! Take it easy, why are you so tired? 

KRAMER

My quilt is still at the cleaners. Jerry, I can't sleep without my quilt. Like the other night? I was cold. So, last night, I turn up the heat - it's too hot. I open up a window - it's too cold. (Frantic) I can't get into a zone! 

JERRY

What is that? (Points to Kramer's pocket as Meryl comes back.) 

KRAMER

Huh? 

JERRY

That? 

KRAMER

Oh, I forgot. (Hands back Jerry's can opener.) 

JERRY

Hey, I'm sorry about all that can opener stuff. 

MERYL

Yeah, me too. I Love you. 

JERRY

I Love you. 

MERYL

Well, goodnight. 

JERRY

Goodnight. (They kiss goodnight, then promptly roll away from each other and go to sleep.) 

GEORGE

They could kick me out of the health club if he tells them! 

ELAINE

So what do you want me to do? 

GEORGE

Talk to him! 

ELAINE

How can I do that? 

GEORGE

You said the guy gave you an open-lipped kiss! 

ELAINE

Yes, but then he wiped his hand on the top of the bottle when I offered him water! 

GEORGE

Well, that doesn't mean anything! 

ELAINE

Are you kidding? That's very significant! If he was interested in me, he'd want my germs! He'd just crave my germs! 

JERRY

She's right, George. Bottle-wipe is big. 

GEORGE

Well, what about the open-lipped kiss? 

JERRY

(still watching tv; sounds like basketball) Bottle-wipe supercedes it. 

GEORGE

Yeah, you're right, you're right. (To Elaine) Alright, maybe he's not interested, but you still know him - can't you just ask him? 

ELAINE

George...but if I ask him now, I will have no chance of going out with him. 

GEORGE

Why? 

ELAINE

I...I don't know... 

GEORGE

Aha. Aha. Could it be because you don't want him to know that you have a friend who pees in the shower, is that it?! 

ELAINE

No, that's not it! 

GEORGE

Oh, I think it is! I think that's exactly what it is! 

ELAINE

Why couldn't you just wait? 

GEORGE

I was there! I saw a drain! 

ELAINE

Since when is a drain a toilet?! 

GEORGE

It's all pipes! What's the difference?! 

ELAINE

Different pipes go to different places! You're gonna mix 'em up! 

GEORGE

I'll call a plumber right now! (Goes for the phone.) 

JERRY

Alright, can we just drop all the pee-pipe stuff here? 

ELAINE

Okay! Okay! Okay, I will talk to him. (Kramer enters.) 

KRAMER

Jerry, I think that quilt is ready. 

JERRY

Alright. 

KRAMER

Well, you gotta pick it up for me! 

JERRY

Alright, I'll pick it up, but it's the last time I'm doin' it! 

KRAMER

I'm so tired! 

ELAINE

Boy, you don't look good. 

KRAMER

Huh? I don't? 

ELAINE

No, you look pale. 

KRAMER

Pale? Oh my God...I gotta meet Anna's parents today! (The phone rings.) 

JERRY

Hello? Oh, hi honey. (annoyed, weary) Yes, I told him. I'll get it. (George and Elaine give each other a look, then leave Jerry to argue with Meryl on the phone.) Whenever. Okay, I'm sorry... 

MARTY

I'm sorry, it's not ready yet. (Kramer bursts in.) 

KRAMER

Not ready? It has to be ready! What kind of a business are you running here? 

MARTY

Who the hell are you? Huh, It's not your quilt. 

JERRY

He's a very good friend of mine, he's kind've like an older brother to me...when things don't go right, he kinda takes it personally. 

MARTY

Well, uh...maybe tomorrow. 

KRAMER

Maybe. 

JERRY

Oh, it's okay, it'll be okay. 

KRAMER

Alright, I'm gonna see you later. 

JERRY

Where you goin'? 

KRAMER

I gotta meet Anna's parents today, remember? I look terrible! I'm gonna hit the tanning machines. 

JERRY

I can't believe you still do that. You know those things are bad for ya. 

KRAMER

Hey, that's how I maintain my glow. 

JERRY

I'm goin' home. 

KRAMER

Ya. 

PAULA

Excuse me? Uh, how much would it cost to clean this? 

MARTY

Oh, about thirteen dollars. 

PAULA

Thirteen? Well, I can't afford that. 

MARTY

Well, I'm sorry. 

ELAINE

Hi, Greg. 

GREG

Hey, Elaine. I'll be off in a second. 

ELAINE

Ok. (Another guy approaches the exercise machine.) I got the machine next, buddy. (Greg finishes up his workout and gets off the machine.) 

GREG

Oh, well, It's all yours. (Walks away. Elaine looks at the machine, then George runs over.) 

GEORGE

What happened? Did he bring it up? 

ELAINE

Never mind that, look at the signal I just got. 

GEORGE

Signal? What signal? 

ELAINE

Lookit. He knew I was gonna use the machine next, he didn't wipe his sweat off. That's a gesture of intimacy. 

GEORGE

I'll tell you what that is - that's a violation of club rules. Now I got him! And you're my witness! 

ELAINE

Listen, George! Listen! He knew what he was doing, this was a signal. 

GEORGE

A guy leaves a puddle of sweat, that's a signal? 

ELAINE

Yeah! It's a social thing. 

GEORGE

What if he left you a used Kleenex, what's that, a valentine? Now you go up to him and you tell him that if he's thinking of turning me in, that I got the goods on him! 

ELAINE

No! I won't be a party to this. 

GEORGE

So you're gonna let me get suspended for shower urination? 

ELAINE

Okay, I'll talk to him. But you're putting me in a very difficult position. (Walks away.) 

PAULA

I won't let you do this! 

JERRY

I want to! 

PAULA

But it isn't right! I can't. 

JERRY

Give me the clothes. 

PAULA

Jerry, please. What about her? 

JERRY

Oh, the hell with her. (Paula dramatically flees from the coffee shop. Jerry thinks for a second, then follows her and catches up to her on the street.) 

PAULA

No, Jerry, please! 

JERRY

I'm not gonna let you walk out of my life. 

PAULA

I can't fight you. (They embrace and kiss passionately.) 

JERRY

Do you want box or hanger? 

PAULA

You decide. (Jerry considers.) 

ELAINE

You're really working up quite a sweat today, huh? 

GREG

Yeah. (Spies the shapely manager of the health club.) Oh, there's the manager. Good. I think I'm gonna talk to her about that guy, you know, we cannot have people like that in here. 

ELAINE

Are you sure you want to do that? 

GREG

Yeah. He's disgusting! Besides, I'll take any chance I can to talk to her. 

ELAINE

You're interested in...in her? (Points at the manager.) 

GREG

Very. 

ELAINE

Ah. You know, uh..I'm engaged. (preens) Yep, gettin' married in fifty years. (Snaps the straps of her leotard against her chest and winces. George walks by the manager.) 

GREG

Oh good, there he is. I wanna be able to point him out. 

ELAINE

You know, Greg, I wouldn't do that if I were you. 

GREG

Why? 

ELAINE

Well, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't it a violation of club policy to not wipe down a machine after using it? 

GREG

Oh, I see...you're friends with the urinator, aren't you? 

ELAINE

Yeah, well, at least he had a drain. 

MARTY

Here you go, Mrs. Seinfeld...with your 25% discount, it comes to $17.80. 

MERYL

Here you go. (Pays Marty, then looks at the clothes on the hanger.) Excuse me, this isn't mine. 

MARTY

Oh, yes it is. Your husband brought it in himself. 

MERYL

Really? (Takes her change and grabs the clothes off the hanger.) Thank you. (Exits.) 

ANNA

That's him! (Opens the door. Kramer stands there, deeply tanned and smiling. Anna and her grandfather are shocked.) 

MERYL

You son of a bitch! 

JERRY

I'm sorry. 

MERYL

Who is she? I want to know who she is. 

JERRY

It doesn't matter. I want a divorce. 

MERYL

A divorce? Oh, so you can marry her and give her the discount? 

JERRY

Yes, that's right. 

MERYL

What happened to us, Jerry? 

JERRY

I'll tell you what happened. We got married. 

MERYL

I'm sorry, uh.. this is my fault. I pushed it on you. 

JERRY

No. I guess I just wasn't ready for the responsibilities of a pretend marriage. 

MERYL

Goodbye, Jerry. Oh, I forgot...(reaches in her purse)...this is your maple syrup. 

JERRY

It's alright, I want you to have it. 

MERYL

(sentimental) Okay, thanks. 

JERRY

We'll always have...pancakes. 

MERYL

Bye, Jerry. (Exits.) 

GRANDPA

I thought you said you was bringin' a white boy home! I don't see a white boy! I see a damn fool! 

NOTE

Originally broadcast as part of a 60 min episode. 

JERRY

You know their timing couldn't be worse. 

GEORGE

Is there ever a good time to have your parents stay with you? 

JERRY

You don't understand, I haven't been together with Rachel for like three weeks. First I was on the road, then my parents show up, I'm getting a little uh backed up. 

GEORGE

When are they leaving for Paris? 

JERRY

Not for another three days. 

GEORGE

What about her place? 

JERRY

She lives with her parents. 

GEORGE

Really? (Jerry shakes his head) Maybe this will become like a cool thing, living with your parents. 

JERRY

(sarcastically) Ya, then maybe baldness will catch on. This will all be turning your way. 

GEORGE

Hey believe me, baldness will catch on. When the aliens come, who do you think they're gonna relate to? Who do you think is going to be the first ones getting a tour of the ship? 

JERRY

The baldies 

GEORGE

Hey by the way my parents really want to have your parents over dinner before they leave town. 

JERRY

That's good, then I get the apartment for at least one night. You know I'm paying for this whole Paris trip it's their anniversary present. 

ALEC

(walking over to Jerry and George's table) Hey guys. 

GEORGE

Hey Alec 

JERRY

Hey Alec 

ALEC

This is Joey. 

GEORGE

Hey Joey, how you doin'? 

ALEC

(Joey was about to talk) Hey listen, I was wondering if either one of you guys would be interested in doing some work for the Big Brother program? I'm kinda running the local chapter. What do you say George? 

GEORGE

Well uh.... 

JOEY

(interrupts) Wouldn't you like to be a big brother to someone like me? Please? 

GEORGE

Well, sure Joey, sure, I would be thrilled. 

ALEC

That's great George, thanks a lot I'll get in touch with you. 

JOEY

Wouldn't you like to be a big brother.. 

ALEC

(grabs Joey to stop him) Ya alright Joey that's enough, let's go (walking over to the counter) See ya. 

JERRY

What happened? 

GEORGE

What could I do? Did you see the mug on that kid? 

JERRY

(acting like Joey) Wouldn't you like to pass the ketchup to someone like me? Please? 

JERRY

Hey did you notice they moved where they do the interview on Jeopardy now? 

GEORGE

Ya it used to be right in the middle of single Jeopardy and now they do it right after single Jeopardy. 

JERRY

Ya, it's much better isn't it? 

GEORGE

Oh, n-no comparison. 

JERRY

Hey, I gotta stop off at the bookstore to pick up my parents one of those French-English dictionaries. 

GEORGE

(stops Jerry realizing something) Hey hey hey hey hey hey. 

JERRY

What? 

GEORGE

Your parents are going to Paris right? 

JERRY

Yea? 

GEORGE

So I tell Alec that I have to go to Paris for an undetermined amount of time. Then all I have to do is buy some post cards and have your parents mail them from Paris. 

JERRY

What about little Joey? 

GEORGE

Who? 

JERRY

Ah, I think he's probably better off. 

GEORGE

I'm trying to get out of this Big Brother program. So when you get to Paris (handing Morty the postcards) all you have to do is drop 'em in any mailbox. 

MORTY

But there are no stamps on these. 

GEORGE

Well no not yet, you gotta buy french stamps (pauses) I-I'll reimburse you of course. 

HELEN

Why are you doing this? 

JERRY

He wants this guy to think he's in Paris. 

HELEN

Why? 

JERRY

Because George is a deeply disturbed individual. 

KRAMER

Oh hey, Helen uh, Could I uh, use some more of your hand lotion? 

HELEN

I told you it was good. (hands Kramer the lotion) 

KRAMER

(putting on the lotion) Ya 

HELEN

It's from the Saks Fifth Avenue in Miami. 

KRAMER

Mmm (smelling the lotion as he rubs it in) I'm gonna remember that if I'm ever in Florida. 

JERRY

Ya, or if you're ever on Fifth Avenue here in New York City, you could get some there. 

KRAMER

Ya 

MORTY

Say those are some nice pants. I got a pair just like them at home. 

KRAMER

Well uh that doesn't surprise me, ya i bought these at Rudy's. It's a used clothing store. See when people like you die, the widows they bring in their wardrobes, they make a bundle. 

GEORGE

Really? My father has a ton of old clothes just sitting up in the attic, y-you think they're worth something? 

KRAMER

Ya if they're vintage, and you're a widow. 

GEORGE

What happens if the husband dies after the wife, who brings in the clothing in then? 

KRAMER

Well I suppose the children do. 

GEORGE

(pondering) Yes I suppose they do. 

KRAMER

(takes another smell of his hands) Alright I gotta a ten o'clock, I'll see everybody later. 

GEORGE

(grabbing his jacket) Hey oo, I just remembered uh my parents really wanna have you guys over for dinner before you leave town. What about tonight? 

HELEN

Tonight? 

GEORGE

Yea they're making Paella. 

HELEN

(looking at Morty) Uh oh I don't think we think we can make it tonight, (turns toward George) we have plans. 

JERRY

(watching the whole conversation from his desk) What plans? 

HELEN

(turns to Jerry) We have plans. 

JERRY

Where'd you get plans? 

HELEN

(annoyed) We have plans. 

GEORGE

Well um, what about tomorrow night? 

HELEN

(turns back toward George) Maybe 

GEORGE

Ok uh, I guess I'll tell them that. 

MORTY

(to George as he is about to leave) Hey give 'em our best though. 

GEORGE

(quietly) Ya. 

JERRY

(walking over toward George and the door) I'll call you later. 

GEORGE

Ya. 

JERRY

So what plans do you have? 

MORTY

None 

JERRY

So how come you're not going over there for dinner? 

HELEN

Jerry we don't care much for the Costanzas'. 

MORTY

We can't stand them. 

JERRY

Really? Since when? 

HELEN

Since always. We've never liked them. 

JERRY

Why? 

HELEN

Well they're so loud, they're always fighting it's uncomfortable, you never notice? 

JERRY

No I notice but they're from your age group I didn't know you could detect abnormal behavior among your own kind. 

MORTY

Well we do. 

JERRY

Ya? 

ELAINE

It's us. 

JERRY

U-oh come on up. (buzzes them up) It's Elaine you don't have a problem with her do you? 

HELEN

We adore Elaine. 

JERRY

She wants to say hi, she's with her new boyfriend. 

HELEN

What's he like? 

JERRY

He's nice, bit of a close talker. 

HELEN

A what? 

JERRY

You'll see. (pause) Boy, I had no idea you felt this way about the Costanzas' 

HELEN

They're exhausting it's like being in an Asylum. 

EVERYONE

Hi. 

MORTY

Hello Elaine 

ELAINE

This is Aaron. 

HELEN

Hello Aaron 

MORTY

Hello. 

AARON

(getting up in Helen's face) So how long you folks in town? 

HELEN

Oh, three more days, three more days then we're off to Paris. 

AARON

Ah 

MORTY

We're going with a select charter group. 

AARON

I love France, (moving over to Morty's face) I was just there last year. In fact, you know I still have an envelope full of French Franks, I'll give 'em to ya. 

HELEN

We can't take money. 

AARON

Oh, no, it's a gift. (looking toward Elaine) from us. 

ELAINE

Oh, that is soo nice (very elaborate nice) Aaron. Isn't he nice? (to Helen) So listen has Jerry been showin' you a good time? 

JERRY

No I haven't. 

AARON

You know (to Morty) I have a friend who works at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. How would you like a behind the scenes tour? 

HELEN

(grabbing Aaron) Really, you could do that? 

AARON

(up in Helen's face) Easily 

HELEN

I wouldn't be any trouble? 

AARON

(gets closer) Of course not. 

HELEN

When would we go? 

AARON

How about right now? 

MORTY

I'm ready 

HELEN

Are you sure? 

AARON

Yes. 

HELEN

Ok, let me get my coat. 

AARON

(walking over to Elaine and getting into her face) Elaine what do you say? 

ELAINE

W-well I don't think so Aaron, uh, I have plans. 

AARON

Oh. (getting into Jerry's face) How about you Jerry? 

JERRY

I'm swamped. 

AARON

You sure? You could examine the art work up close. 

JERRY

Maybe I'll try and catch up with you. 

ELAINE

(under her breath) Ya that'll happen) 

AARON

(Moving toward the door) Alright. We're off. 

MORTY

Ok, bye. 

AARON

Bye. 

JERRY

Ok buh bye. Have a good time. 

ELAINE

Bye. 

AARON

See everybody later (Morty and Helen leave; Aaron closes the door blowing Elaine a kiss) 

JERRY

Ok. 

ELAINE

Why would he ask your parents to go to a museum? 

JERRY

I don't know. 

ELAINE

What is that? 

JERRY

Maybe he was just trying to be nice. 

ELAINE

Have you ever heard of anyone doing anything like this? 

JERRY

Wait a second, he just did me a big favor. 

ELAINE

What? 

JERRY

(dialing) He got em out of the house. 

ELAINE

What? 

JERRY

Call Rachel. 

ELAINE

Oh. 

JERRY

(on the phone) ah no, I got the machine. Rachel! Are you there?! I got the place to myself for a few hours! Rachel! Where are you? Rachel! (hangs up the phone very disappointed) 

ELAINE

(putting on lipstick) Sorry pal, wish I could help you out. 

FRANK

They're not coming? 

GEORGE

No, they had plans. 

ESTELLE

How could they have plans? 

GEORGE

That's what I wanna know. 

FRANK

Well what difference does it make? They wouldn't lie to us, they're are dear friends. 

ESTELLE

What am I supposed to do with all this Paella? 

GEORGE

They said tomorrow, maybe. 

FRANK

Maybe? 

ESTELLE

Maybe they don't like us. 

FRANK

Why wouldn't they like us? (tastes the Paella; disgusted) Again with the pepper? What do you gotta use all the pepper for? 

ESTELLE

Ah keep quiet. 

FRANK

What are you trying to set my mouth on fire? 

GEORGE

I don't know what the reason could be. 

JERRY

(disappointed) Oh, Hi, hi. 

AARON

Ah Jerry you would not believe the time we had. 

HELEN

Aaron is quite the tour guide. 

MORTY

Jerry have you ever seen any of those impressionist paintings? 

JERRY

Oh sure like Monet. 

MORTY

Don't you think he had to be uh near sighted? I mean know body would paint like that if they could see. It's all out of focus. 

JERRY

Well he's from the impressionist school, you know like Monet, Manet, Tippi Tippi Dayday. 

MORTY

I say the guy was painting without his glasses. 

JERRY

(answering phone) Hello? Rachel, ya uh no they're back. 

HELEN

Jerry if you have something to do we could just sit right here and read. 

JERRY

Uh haha ya well uh I'm sorry too I'll call you later, ok bye (hangs phone up) 

AARON

Well I should be going. 

HELEN

Oh thanks again. 

HELEN

Buh bye. 

AARON

Oh you must be Kramer (advances on Kramer to close to his face Kramer walks back into the fridge to avoid him and falls to the ground) I've heard about you. 

KRAMER

You must be Aaron, I've heard about you. 

AARON

(Laughing) Well see you later. 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

AARON

(leaving) Bye 

JERRY

Bye 

KRAMER

So uh what are you guys doing for dinner? 

HELEN

We have no plans. 

MORTY

(noticing Kramer's coat) Look at that, Helen do you see what he's wearing? That's the Executive. 

KRAMER

Now what is Executive? 

JERRY

The belt-less trench coat. My father invented it. 

MORTY

I sure did. Raincoats were my business. The Executive was a classic, these haven't been made in twenty years. 

HELEN

Why would they? Know body bought them then. 

MORTY

He's wearing one. 

KRAMER

Yea these are a hot item over at Rudy's. 

MORTY

You don't say? You know I have boxes of those sitting in my garage in Florida? 

KRAMER

Get 'em up here. You give me twenty-five percent I-I'll take care of everything. 

MORTY

You gotta deal. 

KRAMER

Yaaaa. 

JERRY

This is like the meeting of Smith and Wesson. 

MORTY

I'll call Jack Klompus, he's got a key to the garage. He can send them overnight delivery. 

HELEN

You're gonna first start shipping boxes? We're leaving for Paris in three days. 

MORTY

He'll send them express. 

HELEN

You're crazy. 

MORTY

I'll tell you how crazy I am, I'm gonna pay for this whole trip with these coats. 

JERRY

N-na I'm paying for the trip. 

MORTY

So much the better. 

GEORGE

Anyway it's kind of a fluke thing but uh I'll be leaving for Paris in two days. I will send you a postcard when I get there. 

ALEC

Paris huh? 

GEORGE

Yea, ya..ya know I feel terrible about Joey but it's jus..it's a great business opportunity. I-I don't even know how long I'm gonna be away for. 

ALEC

Where will you stay? 

GEORGE

An apartment complex, the uh the Eiffel Towers. uumm Like I said uh you'll be getting a postcard uh in a few days and again I'm sorry. 

ALEC

George, you have no idea how fantastic this is. 

GEORGE

Fantastic? 

ALEC

Ya, we've been trying to reunite Joey with his father who lives in Paris. But he's afraid to fly alone, you know he's kinda withdrawn, but he seems to take to you. (George smiling in surprise) So it's a perfect solution. 

GEORGE

How gee what a coincidence. 

ALEC

And you'll send me a postcard. 

AARON

Helen really seemed to respond to Renoir. I think she really connected to the way he painted children. 

ELAINE

Mm hmm. 

AARON

And that Morty, I'll tell ya that guy is full of life. (laughs) He was convinced Monet was near sighted. I kept telling him 

ELAINE

Aaron 

AARON

Yes? 

ELAINE

Uh, let me ask you a question. How come you asked Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld to go to the museum with you? 

AARON

Well, they were in from out of town, I thought they would enjoy it. 

ELAINE

Uhuh, um you didn't feel uncomfortable spending the whole day at the museum with two complete strangers who were more than twice your age? 

AARON

No, it was fun. 

ELAINE

You had fun with Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld. 

AARON

Yea, they bought me a coke. 

KRAMER

So how'd you come up with the idea for the belt-less trench coat? 

MORTY

I came home one night, and I tripped over one of Jerry's toys. (Jerry smiling points to himself and nods with cards in his hands) So I took out my belt just to threaten him, and I got a glimpse of myself in the mirror. 

KRAMER

How serendipitous. 

MORTY

So that night I cut off the loops and the Executive was born. 

KRAMER

Mmm 

JERRY

He also came up with an idea for a brimless rain-hat but that never materialized. (to Morty) Alright come on let's play. 

KRAMER

Did you call Jack Klompus yet? 

MORTY

I haven't been able to reach him. Hey I'll call him right now. 

JERRY

Ah come on. 

MORTY

Just a second. (Goes to grab the phone) 

HELEN

Jerry have you seen Schindler's List? 

JERRY

No I haven't seen it yet. 

HELEN

Oh you have to go you have to 

JERRY

I'm going 

HELEN

You have to 

JERRY

Ok 

MORTY

(on the phone) Hello Jack. 

JACK

Ya 

MORTY

It's Morty 

JACK

Who died? 

MORTY

Know body died. Jack I want you to do me a big favor. (Jerry holding up some cards looking at his father) In my garage there are a couple of boxes. 

JACK

What boxes? 

MORTY

I'm gonna explain what boxes. 

JACK

Alright how the hell do I know? 

MORTY

Anyway there are these three big boxes, you can't miss them. I want you to ship them here to New York for me. 

JACK

I thought you're going to Paris 

MORTY

I'm still going to Paris. I got a big deal cooking here. 

JACK

What's in the boxes? 

MORTY

Raincoats. 

JACK

Raincoats? (Doris sighs) You think you're gonna sell those old crappy raincoats? That's garbage. 

HELEN

I guarantee you Doris is not letting him mail those boxes. 

JACK

When do you want these? 

MORTY

Send them tomorrow. 

ESTELLE

You think they're coming tonight? 

GEORGE

I dunno they said maybe. 

FRANK

Of course they're coming, they're leaving soon. If they don't come tonight they might not see us. 

ESTELLE

Well they better come, I got all this Paella. 

FRANK

I admire Morty and Helen going to France. We should take a trip, maybe a cruise. 

GEORGE

Yes a cruise, a long cruise, just the two of you. 

ESTELLE

Georgie what were you doing poking around the attic last night? 

GEORGE

I-I wasn't in the attic. 

ESTELLE

I heard noise. 

GEORGE

Maybe it was a mouse. 

FRANK

(jumping to his feet) OK that's it! We're moving! 

GEORGE

What? 

FRANK

I will not tolerate infestation. 

GEORGE

You haven't even seen one. 

FRANK

Don't you understand the very thought, the very idea, I'll never be comfortable again. 

ESTELLE

Alright Frank that's enough. 

GEORGE

I guess I've been hanging on to them for so long cuz i couldn't accept the fact that Dad was really gone forever (hugs a piece of clothing) 

RUDY

Uh huh. 

GEORGE

They will get a good home won't they? 

RUDY

Look I gotta be honest with you there's nothing here too spectacular. 

GEORGE

Oh I beg to differ. My father took great pride in his appearance, he was a very handsome man, a casanova really. 

RUDY

I'll give you uh two-hundred dollars for the three boxes. 

GEORGE

Could you make it two-twenty-five that was his hi-game in bowling. 

RUDY

Yea I'm in a good mood here. 

GEORGE

Thank you. 

KRAMER

Hey, George what are you doing here? 

GEORGE

Uh, I'm just selling some of Dad's things, (looking into Kramer's eyes) that's what he would have wanted. 

KRAMER

Oh, I gotcha (clicks) 

GEORGE

(leaving) That'll do. 

KRAMER

Oh hey guess what. Morty Seinfeld and I are going into business together, selling raincoats. 

GEORGE

Hey that's swell. 

KRAMER

Yea we worked it out all over dinner last night. 

GEORGE

Dinner? (grabs Kramer) 

KRAMER

Ya. 

GEORGE

You had dinner with the Seinfelds'? 

KRAMER

Yea, last night. 

GEORGE

Was this something you had planned for a while? 

KRAMER

No it was a spur of the moment. Well you know Morty likes to fly by the seat of his vintage pants. 

GEORGE

(hurriedly leaves Rudy's) They had plans, They had plans! 

KRAMER

Oooo, boy I've never seen these before (looking at the clothes George just sold Rudy) 

RUDY

Well they just came in, part of my spring-time cruise collection. Two for twenty-five dollars. 

KRAMER

Oh I'll take these. 

RUDY

Alright 

KRAMER

Hey, remember this raincoat that you sold me? 

RUDY

Sure that's the Executive. 

KRAMER

Ya, you have any others? 

RUDY

I wish, they don't make 'em anymore. 

KRAMER

Suppose I told you I had fifty in mint condition, would you be interested? 

RUDY

Very interested 

KRAMER

Cuz they're coming in from Florida as we speak. 

RUDY

Well bring 'em in. 

KRAMER

So you'll buy them? 

RUDY

I don't see what would possibly stop me. 

GEORGE

Aaaa (looking around for Jerry) aaaa (finds Jerry) Ah ha. They had plans huh? They were busy. They were busy with their (doing a little dance to make the plans seem all that important) big plans! 

JERRY

What are you talking about? 

GEORGE

Mom and Pop Seinfeld 

JERRY

Look I don't know. 

GEORGE

Alright I happen to know what they did last night, they had dinner with Kramer. 

JERRY

Oh they were tired it was a last minute thing. 

GEORGE

So what's the deal they don't want to have dinner with my parents? 

JERRY

That's right. 

GEORGE

Is there something wrong with my parents? 

JERRY

Absolutely 

GEORGE

Because my parents happen to be two pretty wonderful people. 

JERRY

These the people you currently live with? 

GEORGE

Yes. 

JERRY

Uh huh 

GEORGE

So are they coming tonight or not? 

JERRY

Look I really don't know what they're plans are. 

GEORGE

Ok, fine. It's going to be very interesting, very interesting if they don't show up tonight. You know my mother made all this Paella. 

JERRY

What is that anyway? 

GEORGE

It's a spanish dish. It's a moulage of fish, an meat with rice. Very tasty. 

JERRY

I-I'll tell 'em 

GEORGE

Hey could you do one other thing for me? 

JERRY

Name it. 

GEORGE

You think your parents would have any objections to taking a little kid to Paris with them? (Jerry looks at him confused) It turns out that the kid's father lives in Paris. (chuckling) Is that a coincidence? (Jerry smilies) Eh you know Alec wants me to take him over there so I figure as long as they're going (claps) 

JERRY

So you thought as long as they're mailing postcards, it wouldn't be too much to ask my parents to drag a child who they've never seen, through the streets of Paris? 

GEORGE

(pause) Alright if you think it's too much they don't have to mail the postcards. 

JOANNE

So where's he taking you? 

ELAINE

Well first we're going to a matin&eacute;e, I'm taking the afternoon off, we're gonna go see 'My Fair Lady' and they we are gonna go to dinner. He knows all these fantastic places. 

JOANNE

You are one lucky girl. (Elaine laughs in happiness) Wish I could find a nice guy. (Joanne goes to leave; Aaron enters) Hi Aaron. 

AARON

(getting up in Aaron's face) Hey Joanne. (turns to Elaine and goes over to her) Hey 

ELAINE

(already out from behind her desk goes to Aaron) Hi 

HELEN

Hello, Hello. 

MORTY

Hello Elaine 

AARON

I was able to finagle two more tickets to 'My Fair Lady' and I thought why not ask Morty and Helen. 

ELAINE

Oh, Great. 

MORTY

(looking around) This is some office. What's the square footage? 

HELEN

You don't mind to you Elaine? 

ELAINE

Mind? Oh o-of course not. 

AARON

We can make a whole day of it. 

MORTY

This is some building, Harry Fleming used to have an office here. There was a deli on the first floor. You don't get corned beef like that anymore. What happened to that deli? 

ELAINE

(somewhat annoyed) I really don't know Mr. Seinfeld 

JERRY

(stopping them) We better not. (they make out some more; then stop) T-They're gonna be here any second. 

RACHEL

When are they leaving? 

JERRY

In two days. 

RACHEL

It's been soo long. 

JERRY

I know. 

RACHEL

Ok, it's only two more days. 

JERRY

Right, Thursday three o'clock. 

MORTY

(from outside the door; singing) I could have danced all night (entering with Helen) I could have danced all night and still have 

HELEN

Ooh. 

JERRY

Oh Hi. 

HELEN

We didn't know you had company. 

JERRY

(tucking in his shirt) Oh ya this is Rachel. 

RACHEL

Hi. 

MORTY

Hello Rachel. 

HELEN

Uh we'll come back another time. 

JERRY

What other time? 

HELEN

Whenever 

JERRY

Where you goin'? 

MORTY

Uh we'll drive around for a while. 

JERRY

You don't have a car. 

MORTY

We'll take a bus. 

JERRY

Come on stop. 

HELEN

No we don't mind 

MORTY

I'll get a book. 

RACHEL

No no it's ok, I was just leaving anyway. 

HELEN

O-oh are you sure? 

RACHEL

Yea. 

HELEN

Cuz we don't wann.. 

JERRY

(interrupting) No no it's ok. (walking Rachel out) So we'll go see Schindler's List later right? 

RACHEL

Definitely 

JERRY

Ok. Uh 

RACHEL

(going out the door) It's night meeting you. 

HELEN

Nice meeting you. 

JERRY

Ok, see you later. 

MORTY

Boy that was some show. 

JERRY

What show? 

MORTY

'My Fair Lady' 

JERRY

When did you get tickets to see that? 

HELEN

Aaron surprised us, and Elaine came. 

JERRY

Oh (laughing) Elaine really? Well that sounds interesting. 

MORTY

We saw Regis Philbin get out of a limousine. 

JERRY

Oh. 

HELEN

He looks better on TV. 

JERRY

Oh 

JERRY

(answering phone) Hello? 

JACK

Hello Jerry, 

JERRY

Yea. 

JACK

It's Jack Klompus. 

JERRY

Oh hi Jack. 

JACK

So when are you coming down to Florida again? 

JERRY

As soon as is humanly possible. 

JACK

You know I still got that pen, the one that writes upside down. 

JERRY

Yea yea ya I shoulda kept it. 

JACK

So uh where's your father? 

JERRY

Ya he's right here. 

MORTY

Yea 

JACK

Morty, listen I can't get into the garage. 

MORTY

What do you mean? 

JACK

There is something wrong with the key. The key doesn't work 

MORTY

You gotta jiggle it a little bit. I jiggled it. I jiggled it for fifteen minutes. 

DORIS

Tell him to come down here and get his own packages. You have nothing better to do then worry about his boxes. 

MORTY

You gotta pull on the knob as you turn it. 

JACK

Get the hell outta here with your knob. 

DORIS

What does he want from you? 

MORTY

My idiot son could open that garage door. 

JERRY

What did I do? 

MORTY

Just do it first thing tomorrow. I need it. 

MORTY

They'll be here first thing Thursday morning. 

HELEN

Thursday morning? You know we're leaving at three o'clock. 

JERRY

(in a hurry) Yea you're leaving at three o'clock. 

HELEN

How are you gonna get all this done in time? 

MORTY

Don't worry about it. 

JERRY

(in a hurry) Ya how you gonna get all this done in time? 

GEORGE

They were drinking champaign in a buggy! 

FRANK

First Kramer, then Elaine? 

GEORGE

Yea 

FRANK

It's a slap in the face. 

ESTELLE

(with her arms out in wonder) What did we ever do to them? (George puts his arms out and imitates Estelle as she moves her arms up and down as she speaks) I want to know what we did them! 

FRANK

What are they too good for us? A raincoat salesman, I could buy and sell 'em like that. 

ESTELLE

The hell with them. 

GEORGE

(in the threshold between the living room and the kitchen) The thing that bothers me the most, is the lying. 

FRANK

Let's forget about it. We're going on a beautiful vacation. (sits down in his chair) 

GEORGE

(sitting down) Vacation? 

FRANK

You're mother and I are planning on taking a cruise. 

GEORGE

(claps all happy) AH! (half hugs Estelle) 

FRANK

But I can't find any vacation clothes. They were in the attic. 

GEORGE

The attic? Y-you haven't wore any of those clothes for years. 

FRANK

How can I go on a cruise with out my cabana wear? I love those, those clothes. (Looks down yells) AH! (jumps out of his chair) A mouse! I saw a mouse! (takes off into another room with glass doors on it and shuts the door) 

GEORGE

(picking up what Frank saw as a mouse) It's the remote. 

FRANK

(looking from the room; you can see him through the glass) Where the hell are my clothes? I love those clothes. 

RUDY

Lousy moth ridden crap. 

JERRY

Hey. 

MORTY

Hey, Jerry. 

HELEN

So how was the movie? 

JERRY

Oh, really good, really good. 

HELEN

And didn't the three hours go by just like that (snaps her fingers) 

JERRY

Like that (snaps his fingers) 

MORTY

What about the end, with the list? 

JERRY

Ya that was some list. 

HELEN

What did you think about the black and white? 

JERRY

(confused) The black and white. 

MORTY

The whole movie was in black and white. 

JERRY

Oh yea, I didn't even realize. 

MORTY

You don't even think about it, there's so much going on. 

JERRY

Ya ya, I tell ya I could see it again. 

KRAMER

So Klompus has the key, but the jerk couldn't open it up. All you gotta do it jiggle it (has is hand out jiggling) jus get it in there (jiggling making a bunch of noises) jigg jigg jiggle reiggle 

RUDY

Look, I find this whole thing very uninteresting. When you get the coats come in. 

KRAMER

Hey what again? 

GEORGE

I'm trying to buy some of the clothes back. (realizing something) Hey you wanna come over for dinner tonight? My mother made all this extra Paella. 

KRAMER

Paella, ya I'll be there. 

GEORGE

Apparently the Seinfelds' are too good for us. I shouldn't say anything bad about your uh your partner. 

KRAMER

No no you know we're not partners. I only get twenty-five percent. 

GEORGE

Twenty-five percent? It was your idea. 

KRAMER

Yap I know. 

GEORGE

You're doing all the leg work. 

KRAMER

That's right 

GEORGE

He's ripping you off 

KRAMER

You're right he's ripping me off 

GEORGE

If anybody should be getting more it's you. 

KRAMER

He's ripping me off 

GEORGE

Well don't let him take advantage of you like that. 

KRAMER

YAH! (exits) 

RUDY

(coming out of the back-room noticing George) Oh it's you? You're the one who sold me the moth ridden cabana crap. 

MORTY

You know I've been thinking, why is Kramer getting twenty-five percent? 

HELEN

Well he told you about the place. 

MORTY

So what, why is that worth twenty-five percent? It's a finders fee. You know what a finders fee is? 

HELEN

You find something you get a fee. 

MORTY

Finder's fee is ten percent and no more. 

HELEN

Well it's too late now. 

MORTY

Those are my coats. I saved them, I stored them, I've been waiting years for this pay off. 

HELEN

Well you're not gonna say anything. 

KRAMER

I've been thinking about something. 

MORTY

Ya so have I 

KRAMER

Ahh! I don't think the deal is fair. 

MORTY

You don't think it's fair. 

KRAMER

No no, I found the place, I set the whole thing up, I'm doing all the leg work. 

MORTY

What leg work? 

KRAMER

Oh, there's leg work. 

MORTY

If anything you're getting too much. 

KRAMER

Too much?! 

MORTY

That's right, they're my coats. 

KRAMER

Look I want thirty-five percent. 

MORTY

I'm thinking more like fifteen. 

KRAMER

No way I'm taking fifteen. 

MORTY

Well you're not getting thirty-five. 

KRAMER

Alright let's compromise. Twenty-five percent. 

MORTY

Ok it's a deal 

RUDY

Moths are a discourage to my business, all it takes is one moth to lay eggs. You know what happens to the larvae? They hatch and they're everywhere. 

GEORGE

I'm sorry, umm he-here's your money back (gives Rudy the money back) I-I-I'll have the clothes. 

RUDY

(counting the money to make sure it's all there) It's already put a dent in my fumigation bill. 

GEORGE

So uh where are the clothes? 

RUDY

I burned 'em. 

GEORGE

Oh. That's good. 

ELAINE

N-I know they're your parents Jerry an' they're very nice people. But don't you think it's odd, that a thirty-five year old man is going to these lengths to see that someone else's parents are enjoying themselves? I mean don't you find that abnormal? 

JERRY

It is a tad askew. 

ELAINE

I mean they're your parents and you don't do anything. So why is this stranger doing it? 

JERRY

I've hardly been out to dinner with them. 

ELAINE

See, See, I can't even say anything you know because all he's really doing is being nice but but know body is this nice, this is like certifiably nice. 

JERRY

You're right he's insane. 

ELAINE

Yes, he's insane, that's what I think. 

JERRY

So what are you going to do? 

ELAINE

I don't know, I don't know what to do. (sighs) Oh god.... so how was the movie? 

JERRY

Uh from what I saw it was pretty good. 

ELAINE

Ya what do you mean from what you saw? 

JERRY

Well I um I didn't ah actually get to see the whole movie. 

ELAINE

Yea why not? 

JERRY

I was kind of um (pauses) making out. 

ELAINE

(thinks for a second) You were making, out during Schindler's List? 

JERRY

I couldn't help it. We hadn't been alone in a long time, it just got the better of me. 

ELAINE

During Schindler's List? 

JERRY

(trying to justify it) We're both living with our parents. 

ELAINE

Did anybody see you? Did anyone say anything? 

JERRY

No I don't think so. I saw Newman as I was leaving but see me. 

ELAINE

Oh. 

NEWMAN

Hello Mrs. Seinfeld 

HELEN

(like Jerry) Hello, Newman. Jerry's not here. (goes to shut the door on him) 

NEWMAN

Uh ah (stops her from closing the door; walks in) Having a nice trip? (walks over, grabs a junior mint, smells it then puts it in his pocket) 

HELEN

Wonderful, we went to the theater last night. 

NEWMAN

Oh the theater. Because I was wondering. 

HELEN

Wondering what? 

NEWMAN

Why I didn't see you at Schindler's List with Jerry. 

HELEN

Well we already saw it. 

NEWMAN

Oh, well it's a good thing for Jerry that you didn't go. 

MORTY

(getting up from the table and coming over) Why is that? 

NEWMAN

Well he really seemed to have his hands full if you know what I mean. 

HELEN

I'm afraid I don't. 

NEWMAN

Him and his little buxom friend Rachel were going at it pretty good in the balcony. 

MORTY

What? 

NEWMAN

What, do I have to spell it out for ya? He was moving on her like the storm-troopers into Poland. 

HELEN

Jerry was necking during Schindler's List? 

NEWMAN

Yes! A more offensive spectacle I cannot recall. Anyway I just really came up to get some detergent. 

HELEN

Jerry sends his laundry out. 

NEWMAN

(laughing) Oh ho right. Well very nice seeing you folks and a by the way you didn't hear this from me. Tata (runs down the hallway laughing) 

JERRY

Hi (takes off his coat and puts it on the counter at which point his parents are both right by him as he goes into the refrigerator. He grabs a drink then turns around to see his parents right there) What? What did I do? 

HELEN

How could you? 

JERRY

How could I what? 

HELEN

You were making out during Schindler's List? 

JERRY

What? No. 

MORTY

Don't lie Jerry. 

JERRY

(turns) Newman. 

HELEN

How could you do such a thing? 

JERRY

I couldn't help it. We hadn't been alone together in a long time and we just kinda started up a little during the coming attractions and the next thing we knew, the war was over. 

JERRY

(answering the phone) Hello. 

JACK

Hello Jerry, it's Jack Klompus. 

JERRY

Hang on a second. (handing Morty the phone) Dad it's Klompus. 

MORTY

Hello 

JACK

Hello Morty, listen that key doesn't work. It's no good. 

MORTY

You didn't get in? 

JACK

Oh I got in, I had to break the window with a rock and then I got my hand all cut up reaching in. 

MORTY

You broke the window? 

HELEN

He broke the window? 

JACK

You wanted those damn boxes didn't you? 

DORIS

(off camera) He should be on his hands and knees thanking you. 

MORTY

Did you send them? 

JACK

Yea, they'll be there tomorrow afternoon, two o'clock. 

MORTY

Tomorrow afternoon? 

HELEN

Tomorrow afternoon? 

JERRY

Tomorrow afternoon? 

MORTY

I told you to send them express. 

JACK

W-well it was ten dollars cheaper in the afternoon than the morning, I figured what the hell's the difference. 

MORTY

So what did you do about the window? 

JACK

I gotta fix your window now? 

MORTY

Alright alright, goodbye. (Morty hangs up the phone, Jack hangs up the phone) I don't think we are gonna make that flight. 

JERRY

W-what do you mean you're not making the flight? 

HELEN

We have to make the flight, we're with a charter group. If we don't the trip is off. 

MORTY

Well what's the difference we'll go some place else. 

HELEN

Some place else? What about Paris? 

MORTY

You don't understand, I've come this far, I can't stop now. 

HELEN

I can't believe that you're doing all this just to sell some stupid raincoats. 

MORTY

You don't understand fashion is cyclical this thing could come back. 

HELEN

I think you're out of your mind. 

FRANK

I just don't understand how all those clothes can disappear. 

GEORGE

Moths? 

FRANK

Moths, ate three boxes? 

GEORGE

Well you know what happens with larvae hatch, they-they're everywhere. 

ESTELLE

You know, I was thinking today. I never liked those Seinfelds anyway, he's an idiot all together. (Knocking at the door) Ah there's Kramer. 

KRAMER

(from outside) Hello? 

ESTELLE

Hello 

KRAMER

(still outside) Helowwwowwow (Estelle opens the door) Hey (kisses Estelle hello) Ha ha, Good evening (George waves) 

ESTELLE

Hope you're hungry. (goes into the kitchen) 

KRAMER

Ooo Paella 

GEORGE

Hey uh let me take you're coat. 

KRAMER

(giving George his coat) Oh ya thanks buddy. 

FRANK

That shirt, where'd you get that shirt? 

KRAMER

Wha? 

FRANK

That's my cabana shirt, you stole my shirt you son of a bitch! (really fast) George you let your friends go up in my attic and steal my clothes? (grabbing at the shirt) Gimme that back 

KRAMER

(trying to get away) woah 

GEORGE

Dad?! 

KRAMER

(laughs as Frank ends up tickling him; gets away) I bought it from Rudy. 

GEORGE

Rudy?! That skunk, I knew he didn't burn those clothes. 

FRANK

Who's Rudy? What clothes? 

GEORGE

I sold your clothes yesterday. 

FRANK

You sold my clothes (smacks George on the forehead) what do you mean you sold my clothes? 

GEORGE

I didn't think you wore them anymore. 

FRANK

It's cruise wear! 

ESTELLE

Kramer, I love that shirt. 

KRAMER

Yaya 

FRANK

THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S MINE!! 

ESTELLE

You look just like Frank, on our honeymoon. 

KRAMER

Oh, well, thank you. 

FRANK

Who's this Rudy? 

KRAMER

Well Rudy's the guy buying Morty's raincoats. 

FRANK

Morty Seinfeld? He's a bum. 

KRAMER

Well, the whole deal going down tomorrow. Morty's gonna miss his plane for it. 

GEORGE

Missing his plane? Wasn't that a charter flight? 

KRAMER

Yea. 

GEORGE

What happens to charter tickets when you don't use em? 

KRAMER

Well I suppose they are wasted. 

GEORGE

Yes I suppose they are. 

FRANK

Tomorrow I'm going straight down to this Rudy and get my clothes. 

KRAMER

A mouse! 

JERRY

You want the tickets? 

GEORGE

Yes. 

JERRY

You're gonna take this kid to Paris? 

GEORGE

Hey I get a free trip to Paris, I go in the Big Brother's Hall-of-Fame, I mail my own postcards. 

JERRY

You know I'm paying for these tickets. 

GEORGE

It's alright, I got lunch. 

KRAMER

Oh, you should have gone to the Costanzas' for dinner. Mmm the Paella was magnificent. Have you ever had really good Paella? 

MORTY

Not really. 

KRAMER

Oh it's a orgiastic feast for the senses. The want and the festival, the sites, sounds, and colors an mmmummumm mumm 

JERRY

Hey Dad are you sure we are at the right carousel? 

MORTY

This is it. 

KRAMER

So how much are we gonna make? 

MORTY

Take it easy, I've been through a million of these negotiations. 

KRAMER

Wha two thousand? Three thousand? 

MORTY

That's giving it away. This is a one of a kind item. 

KRAMER

More? More than three thousand? 

MORTY

Just watch me do my thing. 

JERRY

Say Dad, (pointing at a raincoat sitting on the carousel next to an open box) isn't that one of yours? 

MORTY

Look at this. Look at how this idiot packed it. He didn't tape it, he just flipped the flaps. (Kramer, Morty and Jerry are looking around grabbing raincoats which are scattered all over the place.) Kramer you missed a couple. 

WOMAN

Bon-jour, welcome to the Gateway to Paris Charter Flight. 

JERRY

(turns around noticing the Charter flight) Dad isn't that your charter group? 

GEORGE

Honesty, hard-work, these are the values that I was raised on. The most important thing Joey, is to be able to look yourself in the mirror before you go to sleep at night. 

JOEY

Hey! I got news for you four eyes, there's no way you're staying with us in Paris. 

FRANK

You burned them? Those clothes are not yours to burn. 

RUDY

Who are you anyways? 

FRANK

I'm the father. 

RUDY

He said his father was dead. 

FRANK

He said I was dead? 

RUDY

That's right. Squeezed an extra twenty-five dollars out of me. 

FRANK

That's what my life is worth to him? Twenty-five dollars. 

KRAMER

Hey, Frank! 

FRANK

Oh, I just want to you know I'm retracting our dinner invitation. 

MORTY

Well you don't have to retract it because we never went. 

FRANK

I'm retracting that it was ever offered. 

MORTY

I retract your retraction. 

FRANK

Oh, you trying to unload some of that junk of yours? 

MORTY

Would you excuse me please, we're conducting business here. 

RUDY

You can keep your raincoats. I'm not interested. 

KRAMER

I thought we had a deal? 

FRANK

That's another one of my shirts!! 

RUDY

I'm not buying anymore clothes from anyone off the street. 

MORTY

Who's off the street? I'm in the raincoat business for thirty-five years. 

RUDY

Ya how do I know there aren't moths like his stuff? 

FRANK

My clothes don't have moths! 

MORTY

Because of his moths you're not buying my raincoats? 

RUDY

That's right. 

KRAMER

(laughing) I'm all ticklish. (a moth flies out of his shirt; they all look at it) 

ANNOUNCEMENT

Flight-433 now boarding for Miami, Gate 18a. Flight-433 now boarding. 

MORTY

Ok, let's go. 

HELEN

(to Aaron) It was so nice of you to come to the airport to see us off. 

AARON

Are you sure you can't stay a little longer? 

JERRY

NO. 

MORTY

Ah, good-bye. 

ELAINE

Good-bye 

JERRY

Take care 

MORTY

Alright Jer. 

ELAINE

Nice to see.. 

MORTY

Buh bye Elaine 

JERRY

Buh bye. 

HELEN

Buh bye. 

HELEN

(looking at Jerry while being overly hugged by Aaron) We'll call you when we get home. 

AARON

Thank you. 

JERRY

I think she meant me, but. 

MORTY

Make sure Kramer uses good tape when he sends back the raincoats. 

JERRY

Ok. 

ELAINE

Bye. 

JERRY

Bye. 

ELAINE

Aaron? Aaron are you ok? 

AARON

I could've done more. I could've done so much more. 

ELAINE

You did enough. 

AARON

(turning toward her) No, I could've called the travel agency, got them on another flight to Paris, I coulda got them out. 

JERRY

You tried Aaron, it was too expensive. 

AARON

(holds his arm up) This watch, this watch could've paid for their whole trip. (holds his other hand up) This ring, this ring is one more dinner I could've taken them out to. (Jerry and Elaine look at each other like he's crazy) Water, they need some water (turns around and runs to the Flight Agent) 

ELAINE

Why? 

AARON

(to the Flight Agent) They'll get dehydrated on the plane! Get the Seinfelds some water. Please! Please! 

JERRY

Hi Mr. Goldstein is Rachel home? 

GOLDSTEIN

I'm afraid Rachel's not going to be able to see you tonight, or any other night for that matter. 

JERRY

Why what did I do? 

GOLDSTEIN

(Rachel is know seen behind her Dad) You know very well. I heard about your behavior at the movies the other night it was disgraceful. You should be ashamed of yourself, I for one will not allow my daughter to be involved with someone of such weak moral fiber. Fortunately my postman happened to have witnessed the entire incident. A heavy set fellow, I believe he lives in your building. (Jerry turns to almost do a 'Newman') Now if you don't mind. (starts to close the door) 

JERRY

Rachel! 

GOLDSTEIN

(closing the door on Jerry) Good night! 

JERRY

Rachel! 

JERRY

So my parents get home, they open the door, my father flicks the light on, the whole place is cleaned out, everything. 

ELAINE

Aahh, (pushes Jerry from her seat at the table) Get Out! How did it happen? 

JERRY

The broken window, Klompus never fixed it. They just walked right in. 

ELAINE

Oohh, boy. They could use a vacation. 

JERRY

Yea they're taking one, the travel agent is trying to set something else up for them. 

ELAINE

(sighs) So how about that Aaron? 

JERRY

Whew 

ELAINE

You know what drove me crazy about him? Did you ever notice that he stood too close to you when he talked? 

JERRY

No I hadn't noticed. 

NEWMAN

(at the counter) Pair of bear claws please. 

JERRY

(hearing Newman turns and sees him) Hiya Newman. 

NEWMAN

(moving away from the counter getting closer to the door) Hello Jerry. 

JERRY

Say, I happened to catch you coming out of Schindler's List the other night. 

NEWMAN

Ohh, were you there? 

JERRY

Yes I was. 

NEWMAN

(looking scared) I-it's a it's a...powerful film. 

JERRY

Yes, shocking brutality don't you think? 

NEWMAN

(couple quick breaths) Shocking. 

JERRY

Yes, well that was nothing. 

NEWMAN

(running out the door) Jerry! Jerry! 

GEORGE

Where the hell is your father?! 

ESTELLE

This is the best thing we ever did. 

FRANK

I just hope those exterminators know what they're doing. 

ESTELLE

Ah forget about them let's just... 

TOBY

These are great! Just great! Really great! Really, really great! Don't you think so, Elaine? 

ELAINE

Yeah, really great. 

TOBY

Oh, a coffee table book about coffee tables! (To Kramer) How did you come up with this idea? 

KRAMER

It was there! 

TOBY

Oh, look at this one! It's saying, 'I'm a coffee table, put some coffee on me! Oh, the hotter the better, that's what I'm here for!' (laughs) 

ELAINE

You know actually, I've got some work I gotta do, so... 

KRAMER

Hey, how about if the book came with these little fold-out legs...so the book itself becomes a coffee table? 

TOBY

Ohhh, that is a great idea! Really, really great! 

ELAINE

'Oooh, and that coffee table is saying, put some coffee on me!' I'd like to put some coffee on her. Hot, scalding coffee - right in her face! I swear! This is like working with a contestant from 'The Price Is Right'! (demonstrates a winner on 'The Price Is Right') 

JERRY

Yeah, that's real interesting. Elaine, listen, tell me if you think this is funny - (reads comedy he's written) 'Men definitely hit the remote more than women...men don't care what's on TV, men only care what else is on TV. Women want to see what the show is before they change the channel, because men hunt and women nest.' 

ELAINE

Yeah, it's funny, I dunno. 

JERRY

You don't know? Come on, that's gold! 

ELAINE

Well, I don't know about 'gold.' 

JERRY

Oh, that's gold, baby. 

ELAINE

'Baby'? What, are you doing George now? 

JERRY

I was saying 'baby' way before George! 

ELAINE

Well, I don't know, don't ask me any more questions about jokes, Jerry, it just puts too much pressure on me. 

JERRY

Well, this guy Leonard Christian's gonna be there tomorrow night. 

ELAINE

Yeah, who's he? 

JERRY

He's a writer from Entertainment Weekly . I would like to have a good show. 

KRAMER

Danke schoen, my little dumplings. 

ELAINE

Hi. 

KRAMER

Hey, how about that Toby, huh? 

ELAINE

Yeah, how about her? 

KRAMER

Ooh, she's a package full of energy! 

ELAINE

Yeah, she's a package full of something. 

KRAMER

Yeah, and that something is life. Jerry, you gotta meet this gal - she's brimmin' with positivity! 

ELAINE

Oh, pleeeeease. (moves to the living room and sits down) 

KRAMER

Hey, are you performing tomorrow? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

KRAMER

Great, I'm gonna bring Toby. 

JERRY

Well, you better laugh 'cause I'm being reviewed. Leonard Christian's gonna be there. 

KRAMER

Oh, she's a great laugher - right, Elaine? 

ELAINE

Oh yeah, she's a great laugher, Jerry. (imitates Toby) Really, really great! 

JERRY

Well, you want to sit with George? I think he's coming with Robin. 

KRAMER

Is that the waitress from the comedy club? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

KRAMER

Oh. 

ELAINE

What about her kid, is she bringing him, too? 

KRAMER

She's got a kid? 

JERRY

Yeah, you should see George get along with this kid! 

GEORGE

Ow! What are you doing under there? Hey, stop that! Don't eat that! That's not food! (to Robin) He's suckin' down Equal packets! 

ROBIN

Do you think 25 kids is too much? 

GEORGE

25 kids for his birthday party? (to kid under table) Don't put your tongue on the floor! He's putting his tongue on the floor! Here, here, have some more sugar packets. (tosses some Equal packets under the table) 

ROBIN

So, what about entertainment? (to kid) Should I get Barney? 

KID

No Barney! 

ROBIN

Maybe a clown. 

GEORGE

How about Bozo? 

KID

Who's Bozo? 

GEORGE

Who's Bozo? Bozo the Clown, that's who Bozo is. When I was a kid, Bozo the Clown was the clown, bar none. 

ROBIN

George... 

GEORGE

With the orange hair, and the big clown shirt with the ruffles... 

ROBIN

George... 

GEORGE

He had a TV show! He had cartoons! 

ROBIN

George! Forget Bozo, George. Bozo's out. He's finished. It's over for Bozo. 

GEORGE

You know, when I was a kid, we didn't have these elaborate birthday parties w-with catered food and entertainment. I remember my 7th birthday party... 

FRANK

Blow out the candles! Blow out the candles, I said! Blow out the damn candles! 

ESTELLE

Stop it, Frank! You're killing him! 

FRANK

Blow out the candles!! 

ROBIN

Well, this time, you can blow out the candles. 

GEORGE

Nah, I have asthma. (Robin's kid grabs George's leg from under the table, and George struggles.) 

TOBY

Hi! 

ELAINE

Hi, Toby. 

TOBY

How are you doing today? 

ELAINE

Fine... (Toby sits and waits for Elaine to speak.) How are you? 

TOBY

Oh, I'm great! Just great. Really great! Oh, hey - did you hear about Bob Rosen? 

ELAINE

Nope. 

TOBY

He is going to Knopp. He is going to be a vice president. 

ELAINE

Knopp? Really? Boy. That means there's an opening here for senior editor...has Lippman, uh, hired anyone? 

TOBY

No. I hear he wants to promote someone in-house. 

ELAINE

Really!? 

TOBY

Maybe it'll be you! 

ELAINE

Oh...well... 

TOBY

You really deserve it. I mean, you have experience, seniority...Lippman really respects your opinion... 

ELAINE

Well! Well, it could be you. 

TOBY

No... 

ELAINE

No, really. 

TOBY

Really? You think so? 

ELAINE

Sure. 

TOBY

Boy, wouldn't that be exciting! 

ELAINE

I mean, stranger things have happened... 

TOBY

Wow! Me! A senior editor! (deadly serious) I'd like that. 

ELAINE

Well, you shouldn't get your hopes up, Toby. 

TOBY

Well, it's a possibility, like you said! Stranger things have happened! Thank you, Elaine. Thank you. (Exits.) 

JERRY

Hey, Ronnie. 

RONNIE

Hey. 

JERRY

(To bartender) Can I have a club soda? (To Ronnie) Goin' on tonight? 

RONNIE

Yeah. You? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

RONNIE

You know Leonard Christian's here? 

JERRY

Yeah, I know. 

RONNIE

Can I ask you something? Are my nostrils getting bigger? 

JERRY

(looking at his nostrils) I don't...think so. 

RONNIE

Are you sure? Take a good look. They seem a little bigger? 

JERRY

I don't...I dunno. 

RONNIE

Is it possible for nostrils to expand? 

JERRY

Oh, is this a bit? 

RONNIE

Hey, I don't do 'bits.' I'm a prop comic. Dammit, I can't find my water gun. I can't go on without my water gun. 

KRAMER

Hey, Jerry. 

JERRY

(turns to greet Kramer) Hey. 

KRAMER

Well here's Toby, (points to Jerry in order to introduce him to Toby) Jerry. 

TOBY

This is so exciting! Look, I have goosebumps! (To Jerry) Touch! Touch them! (Jerry touches her arm. Toby screeches with excitement.) I've never been to a comedy club before! 

JERRY

Really! You know, a lot of restaurants are serving brewed decaf now, too. 

TOBY

You are so funny! 

JERRY

Oh, you'll have a good time, I swear. 

TOBY

Oh! He swears like he thinks I don't believe him. I believe you. I believe you! Oh, he's so funny! (laughs) 

KRAMER

What about me? 

TOBY

What about you? (laughs) I'm only kidding. You're funny, too. I love to laugh. 

JERRY

Good, good. 

KRAMER

So, you up next? 

JERRY

Yeah, why don't you guys get a table so you'll have good seats? 

TOBY

Oh yeah, we don't want some jerk sitting in front of us, it'll be like, 'Hey, big head, can you move out of the way? I didn't pay a cover charge to stare at your bald spot.' (laughs) 

KRAMER

Alright, so you have a good show, huh buddy? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

TOBY

Oh, have a great show. Hey, we'll make sure it's a great show! 

JERRY

O.k., good, I'll see you later. (Kramer and Toby are about to exit. She turns around and clutches Kramer's jacket.) 

TOBY

Oh, he's so great! This is so great! I'm so excited! 

JERRY

Men definitely hit the remote button more than women... 

TOBY

Oh, really! Really! That is so true! 

JERRY

Yes, yeah...see, men don't care what's on TV, men only care what else is on TV. 

TOBY

Yes! Yes! Right on! Right on! (Other audience members give her puzzled looks.) 

JERRY

See...women really want to see what the show is before they change the channel... 

TOBY

Oh, that is so true, yes! 

JERRY

...that's why men hunt and women nest. 

TOBY

BOO! BOO! Hiss! Boo! (Toby's obnoxious behavior causes Jerry to completely lose his place and mess up his act.) 

JERRY

Yea, ya, so...anyway what was I talking about. 

KRAMER

Hey. 

JERRY

Hey, what's the deal? What was goin' on there? I invite you down here, I have an important show, and she heckles me?! 

KRAMER

Look, she didn't mean anything. 

JERRY

Well, what is the matter with her? Is she crazy?! 

KRAMER

She's just being enthusiastic, that's all! 

JERRY

Hey! What is wrong with you?! 

TOBY

Me? Nothing's wrong with me. 

JERRY

Y-You boo me?! You hiss?! You didn't stop blathering throughout the whole set! 

TOBY

Oh, come on! I thought you're a pro! That's part of the show. 

JERRY

No! Not part of the show! Booing and hissing are not part of the show! You boo puppets! You hiss villains in silent movies! 

TOBY

Well, that's the way I express myself. How are you gonna make it in this business if you can't take it? 

JERRY

Oh, I can take it. 

TOBY

Let's go. (Ronnie walks by Jerry.) 

RONNIE

Hey, man. Good set. 

GEORGE

Bozo? 

ERIC

No. 

GEORGE

B-O-Z-O? 

ERIC

Sorry, I... 

GEORGE

You've never heard of Bozo the Clown? 

ERIC

No! 

GEORGE

How could you not know who Bozo the Clown is? 

ERIC

I don't know, I just don't. 

GEORGE

How can you call yourself a clown and not know who Bozo is? 

ERIC

Hey, man - what are you hassling me for? This is just a gig, it's not my life. I don't know who Bozo is, what - is he a clown? 

GEORGE

Is he a clown? What, are you kidding me!? 

ERIC

Well, what is he? 

GEORGE

Yes, he's a clown! 

ERIC

Alright, so what's the big deal! There's millions of clowns! 

GEORGE

Alright, just forget it. 

ERIC

Me forget it? You should forget it! You're livin' in the past, man! You're hung up on some clown from the sixties, man! 

GEORGE

Alright, very good, very good...go fold your little balloon animals, Eric. Eric! (chuckles) What kind of name is that for a clown, huh? 

MOTHER

Excuse me...you must be George! I'm Robin's mother. Oh, you seem like such a lovely young man! 

GEORGE

Well, I do what I can. (Robin comes over.) 

ROBIN

Hi Mom, how's everything? 

MOTHER

Oh, this is just a wonderful party! 

ROBIN

The burgers should be ready in a minute. 

GEORGE

Ah, great, great. (sniffs) What's that smell? Smoke? (walks to the kitchen) Hey everybody, I think I smell some smoke back here...(smoke boils into the doorway.) FIRE! FIRE! Get out of the way! 

GEORGE

It was an inferno in there! An inferno! (Eric, Robin's mother, and all the kids rush at George.) 

ERIC

There he is! That's him! (Tries to clobber George with his big shoe.) 

MOTHER

That's the coward that left us to die! 

GEORGE

I...was trying to lead the way. We needed a leader! Someone to lead the way to safety. 

ROBIN

But you yelled 'get out of my way'! 

GEORGE

Because! Because, as the leader...if I die...then all hope is lost! Who would lead? The clown? Instead of castigating me, you should all be thanking me. What kind of a topsy-turvy world do we live in, where-where heroes are cast as villains? Brave men as cowards? 

ROBIN

But I saw you push the women and children out of the way in a mad panic! I saw you knock them down! And when you ran out, you left everyone behind! 

GEORGE

Seemingly. Seemingly, to the untrained eye, I can fully understand how you got that impression. What looked like pushing...what looked like knocking down...was a safety precaution! In a fire, you stay close to the ground, am I right? And when I ran out that door, I was not leaving anyone behind! Oh, quite the contrary! I risked my life making sure that exit was clear. Any other questions? 

FIREMAN

How do you live with yourself? 

GEORGE

Its not easy. 

GEORGE

So she doesn't want to see me anymore. 

JERRY

Did you knock her over too, or just the kids? 

GEORGE

No, her too. And her mother. 

JERRY

Really? Her mother. 

GEORGE

Yeah. I may have stepped on her arm, too, I don't know. 

JERRY

You probably couldn't see because of the smoke. 

GEORGE

Yeah. But it was somebody's arm. 

JERRY

Hmm. So you feel 'women and children first,' in this day and age, is somewhat of an antiquated notion. 

GEORGE

To some degree. 

JERRY

So basically, it's every man, woman, child, and invalid for themselves. 

GEORGE

In a manner of speaking. 

JERRY

Yeah, well, it's honest. 

GEORGE

Yeah. She should be commending me for treating everyone like equals. 

JERRY

Well, perhaps when she's released from the burn center, she'll see things differently. 

GEORGE

Perhaps. 

JERRY

So, what was the fire? Just a couple of greasy hamburgers? 

GEORGE

Yeah. Eric the Clown put it out with his big shoe. 

JERRY

By the way, did you see this? (Hands George a magazine) 

GEORGE

What's that? 

JERRY

It's the Leonard Christian article about my show. Plus my gig in Miami got cancelled, I betcha it's because of the article. 

GEORGE

Wow, he really does a number on you. (reads) 'Seinfeld froze like a deer in the headlights in the face of incessant heckling.' 

JERRY

I should have let her have it! I held back because of Kramer. 

GEORGE

You know what you oughta do. You should go to her office and heckle her. 

JERRY

Yeah, right. 

GEORGE

You know, like all the comedians always say, 'How would you like it if I came to where you work and heckled you?' 

JERRY

Yeah, that'd be something. 

GEORGE

I'm not kidding, you should do it. 

JERRY

But wouldn't that be the ultimate comedian's revenge? I've always had a fantasy about doing that. 

GEORGE

Well, go ahead! Do it! 

JERRY

Why can't I? 

GEORGE

No reason! 

JERRY

You know what? I think I'm gonna do that! She came down to where I work, I'll go down to where she works! 

GEORGE

This is unprecedented! 

JERRY

There's no precedent, baby! 

GEORGE

What...are you using my babies now? 

JERRY

Hey, nice shoes. What, you wear sandals to work? It's always nice to walk into a room and get the aroma of feet. That's real conducive to the work atmosphere. I'm sure your co-workers really appreciate it. 'Hey, let's go eat in Toby's office. Great idea! We can check on her bunions!' 

TOBY

You know, I have work to do here! I'm very busy! 

JERRY

Oh, is this disruptive? You find it hard to work with someone...interrupting? 

TOBY

Well, how would you like it if I called security? 

JERRY

Security? Well, I don't know how you're gonna make it in this business if you can't take it! Ya gotta be tough! Booo! Boooo! 

TOBY

No, (gets up out of her chair) that's it. (Kramer arrives; to Kramer) Get out of the way. 

KRAMER

Hey, what's going on? 

JERRY

Boo! 

KRAMER

What's happenin' here? 

JERRY

Hiss! 

KRAMER

(going after Toby) Toby! Toby! 

TOBY

(voice; screaming) My pinky toe! 

KRAMER

(voice; yelling) Toby! (Shot of a shocked Kramer is shown) Oh, Oh! 

KRAMER

What did you go up there to heckle her for? 

JERRY

Because she came down to the club and heckled me! Give her a taste of her own medicine! (George enters.) 

KRAMER

Oh, YEAH! You gave her a taste of medicine, alright. 

JERRY

Well, I didn't want her to have an accident. 

GEORGE

What accident? 

KRAMER

Well, after he heckled Toby, she got so upset, she ran out of the building and a street sweeper ran over her foot and severed her pinky toe. 

GEORGE

That's unbelievable! 

KRAMER

Yeah! Then after the ambulance left, I found the toe! So I put it in a Cracker Jack box, filled it with ice, and took off for the hospital. 

GEORGE

Wha.. you ran? 

KRAMER

No, I jumped on the bus. I told the driver, 'I got a toe here, buddy - step on it.' 

GEORGE

Holy cow! 

KRAMER

Yeah, yeah, then all of a sudden, this guy pulls out a gun. Well, I knew any delay is gonna cost her her pinky toe, so I got out of the seat and I started walking towards him. He says, 'Where do you think you're going, Cracker Jack?' I said, 'Well, I got a little prize for ya, buddy - ' (Kramer throws two quick punches and a massive uppercut) - knocked him out cold! 

GEORGE

How could you do that?! 

KRAMER

Then everybody is screamin,' because the driver, he's passed out from all the commotion...the bus is out of control! So, I grab him by the collar, I take him out of the seat, I get behind the wheel and now I'm drivin' the bus. 

GEORGE

You're Batman. 

KRAMER

Yeah. Yeah, I am Batman. Then the mugger, he comes to, and he starts chokin' me! So I'm fightin' him off with one hand and I kept drivin' the bus with the other, y'know? Then I managed to open up the door, and I kicked him out the door you know with my foot, you know - at the next stop. 

JERRY

You kept makin' all the stops? 

KRAMER

Well, people kept ringin' the bell! 

GEORGE

Well, wha-what about the toe? What happened to the toe? 

KRAMER

Well! I am happy to say that the little guy is back in place at the end of the line. 

GEORGE

You did all this...for a pinky toe? 

KRAMER

Well, it's a valuable appendage. 

JOANNE

So, Kramer found the toe, and they re-attached it. 

ELAINE

Really. 

JOANNE

Yea, poor kid. What an ordeal. 

MICHAEL

And you know how extremely sensitive she is? 

ELAINE

I know. 

MICHAEL

She's gonna need our full support. 

ELAINE

Yeah, right. 

HALLWAY

Look who's here! Toby! (Toby enters on crutches.) 

MICHAEL

Toby, what can I do? Can I get you something? 

TOBY

Oh no, no thank you. 

MICHAEL

Toby please let us help. We're family. 

TOBY

Oh well, I could use some coffee. 

JERRY

She got the promotion? 

ELAINE

Yep. 

JERRY

Why? 

ELAINE

I'll tell ya why. Because of her pinky toe, that's why. Because Lippman felt so sorry for her, he didn't want to hurt her feelings. 

JERRY

Too bad. 

ELAINE

Sure, the pinky toe is cute! But, I mean, what is it? It's useless! It does nothing. It's got that little nail that is just impossible to cut. What do we need it for? 

JERRY

Because Elaine, that's the one that goes 'wee-wee-wee all the home.' 

ELAINE

Why don't you just shut the f- 

KRAMER

Hey Elaine, did you hear the good news? Toby got promoted! 

ELAINE

Yes, I heard, Kramer - I work there, remember?? 

KRAMER

Yeah, and you know what she told me? She said her first order of business is to put my coffee table book into the bookstores as soon as possible. 

ELAINE

Oh, wonderful! 

KRAMER

You know, throughout this whole thing, she always kept a smile on her face. 

ELAINE

Oh, of course! She's deranged. 

JERRY

I went down to the magazine, I pleaded with him to come and see me again, finally he agreed to come down tonight, and he's going to write another article. 

RONNIE

I heard you went down to somebody's office and heckled them? 

JERRY

Damn right! We've been lapdogs long enough! 

RONNIE

How could you do that? I mean, everybody's talking about it. 

JERRY

Yeah well, it's about time one of us drew a line in the sand. 

RONNIE

Jerry, you're like Rosa Parks. You opened the door for all of us. I can't wait till the next time someone heckles me. 

JERRY

Yeah, well, it won't be long. 

ANNOUNCER

Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Jerry Seinfeld! 

JERRY

Gotta go. (heads out on stage) 

GEORGE

Robin? Robin! 

ROBIN

George, what is it? I'm working. 

GEORGE

Robin, listen to me. The most amazing thing has happened. Kramer has opened my eyes. I think I've changed. 

ROBIN

What are you talking about? 

GEORGE

O.k....(is about to explain. Cut to Jerry on-stage.) 

JERRY

I mean, Bozo the Clown...I mean does he really need 'the clown' in his title, as clown? Bozo, 'the' clown? Are we going to confuse him with Bozo the district attorney? Bozo the pope? There's no other Bozo... 

GEORGE

...you'll see, things will be different now - if you just give me one more chance. 

ROBIN

L-listen, Listen...I gotta think about this. (walks away.) 

GEORGE

Alright, but I'm serious about this. 

RONNIE

Alright, hand it over man! 

JERRY

...that's why men hunt and women nest. 

GEORGE

He's got a gun! He's got a gun! Get out of the way! (Tries to flee the bar in a mad panic. The audience in the club also goes nuts and heads for the exits. Jerry stands onstage, perplexed.) 

ROBIN

George! This is Ronnie Kaye! 

GEORGE

The prop comic? (Ronnie holds up his water gun and smiles.) Oh, hi...I didn't recognize you, what...did you get a haircut? 

RONNIE

Nostrils. 

JERRY

George - could I have a word? 

KRAMER

All right, get off at the next exit. 

JERRY

Kramer, I've driven to east Hampton many times, I know the exit. 

KRAMER

It's a great house, pool, sun deck? Yeah, I'll be there. 

JERRY

(To Elaine) You sure we're makin' the right move? 

ELAINE

We gotta see the new baby anyway, at least we'll get a weekend in the Hamptons out of it. 

JERRY

Didn't they just have a baby? 

ELAINE

That was two years ago, remember? 'Jeh-Ree, you gotta see the Bay-Bee! You gotta see the Bay-Bee!' 

JERRY

Is it possible they're just having babies to get people to visit them? 

KRAMER

Hey Jerry, you ever wear silk underwear? 

JERRY

No. 

KRAMER

Put that on the top of your list. 

JERRY

No, not for me. A little too delightful. Well, George and Jane should be almost there by now. 

ELAINE

Oh, isn't that weird that George and Jane haven't had sex yet, but they're spending a weekend together? 

JERRY

I know, George is pretty pleased about it. It's like she signed a letter of intent. 

ELAINE

When's Rachel comin' out? 

JERRY

She's makin' the three o'clock train. 

ELAINE

Her father is so religious, I'm just amazed that he's letting you see her again after that Schindler's List make-out session. 

JERRY

I bought him some kishka. 

KRAMER

What's that? 

JERRY

It's kind of a stuffed meat thing. Israeli soldiers carry it. In case they're captured behind enemy lines, they eat it and it kills them. 

GEORGE

I never tasted a cough medicine I didn't love. 

JANE

Me too. I love cough medicine. 

GEORGE

You see? We were made for each other. (Thinking to himself) It's amazing. If I reach out and touch her breast right not, she'd scream and throw me out of the car. But at this time tomorrow, I could touch it all I want. 

JANE

What's your favorite? 

GEORGE

Potussan. Ever try it with club soda? 

JANE

No. 

GEORGE

Oh, very refreshing. (Thinking again) Sex is like joining a private club. I'll be the same me tomorrow, but suddenly, the no trespassing sign will be gone. 

JANE

Are we almost there? 

GEORGE

Yeah, about ten, fifteen minutes. But I have to stop at a vegetable stand. 

JANE

What for? 

GEORGE

My mother loves Hampton tomatoes. She's nuts for Hampton tomatoes. 

JANE

Can you buy 'em later? I really wanna get some... sun. 

KRAMER

Hey Jerry. Rub some lotion on my back. 

JERRY

Who are you, Mrs. Robinson? 

KRAMER

Come on, I'll rub some on yours. 

JERRY

No, that's no sweet'ning the deal. No. 

GEORGE

(To Jane) You know, when I was a kid, I once found a dollar and fifty cents in change on the bottom of the pool. 

JANE

(No feeling in her voice) You must've been excited. 

GEORGE

Yeah. Hey, you know, I gotta go get these tomatoes. You wanna go for a ride? 

JANE

I don't think so. 

GEORGE

'Kay. I'll uh, I'll see you later. Anybody want some tomatoes? 

JERRY

No thanks. 

KRAMER

No. (George leaves for the tomatoes) 

JANE

I'm gonna take a dip. (She leaves for beach, Elaine enters with a shady hat on) 

JERRY

And then there's Maude. (She sits down next to Jerry) 

ELAINE

Look at my face, look at it. You see any lines? 

JERRY

No lines. 

ELAINE

You know why? One word: shade. 

JERRY

So when are we gonna see this baby? When is the momentous event? 

ELAINE

I don't know. They're takin' a nap or something. 

KRAMER

I'm gonna go see if there are any girls on the beach. Elaine, you wanna come? 

ELAINE

(Sarcastic) No thanks. I got plenty of girlfriends. 

JERRY

(Looking toward beach) Oh this is interesting. 

ELAINE

What? 

JERRY

Jane's topless. (They all look) 

KRAMER

Yo yo ma. 

JERRY

Boutros Boutros-Ghali. 

ELAINE

Nice rack. (Carol and Michael inside open back door) 

CAROL

Come on, you guys. You can come and see the bay-bee! 

JERRY

Oh, in a minute, Carol. 

KRAMER

We're gonna be right there. 

JERRY

This is weird wild stuff. George hasn't even seen her yet. 

ELAINE

Why do you think we're getting the sneak preview? 

KRAMER

Maybe she's trying to create a buzz. 

ELAINE

What? 

KRAMER

You know, get some good word of mouth goin'. 

JERRY

Oh, here she comes. (They pretend to not have watched as Jane enters) 

JANE

I'm thirsty. Anyone want a drink? 

JERRY

No thanks. 

ELAINE

I'm good. 

KRAMER

Deh-deh-deh-deh- (Jane exits) All right, show's over. I'm goin' to the beach. 

CAROL

Adam (the baby's name), Jerry and Elaine are here. 

ELAINE

Oh, he's a cute little shnugly baby. 

CAROL

Isn't he gorgeous? (Elaine looks at baby, only to be frightened and turn away) 

ELAINE

Ugghh. 

CAROL

Is she gorgeous? (Elaine and Jerry looking away) 

ELAINE

Oh, gorgeous, yes. 

JERRY

So very gorgeous. 

CAROL

Michael, shut the door! You're letting bugs in. 

JERRY

Is it me or was that the ugliest baby you have ever seen? 

ELAINE

Uh, I couldn't look. It was like the Pekinese. 

JERRY

Boy, a little too much chlorine in that gene pool. (They sit) And, you know, the thing is, they're never gonna know, no one's ever gonna tell them. 

ELAINE

Oh, you have to lie. 

JERRY

It's a must lie situation. 

ELAINE

Yes, it's a must lie situation. 

JERRY

You know, I don't think we should tell George we saw Jane topless. 

ELAINE

No, I don't think so. 

JERRY

In fact remind me to tell Kramer too. 

KRAMER

Oooh, lobsters. 

BEN

Oh this ointment should do it. 

CAROL

How are you feeling, Adam? (She sees Elaine in the hall) Elaine! (Elaine enters) This is our pediatrician, Ben Feffa. 

ELAINE

Hi. 

CAROL

Look at him, Elaine. How gorgeous is he? I ask you, how gorgeous? 

ELAINE

(Looking at Ben) Pretty gorgeous. 

BEN

Elaine, you have children? 

ELAINE

Me? Oh no, but I'd love to have a baby, I mean, I can't wait to have a baby. I'm just dyin' to have a baby. 

BEN

A beautiful woman like you should. You're quite breathtaking. 

ELAINE

Breathtaking? I'm breathtaking? 

CAROL

And he's very particular. Ben, you're staying tonight, right? 

BEN

Uh, Sure. (Elaine celebrates to herself as Jerry enters and quickly looks away from the baby) 

JERRY

Ah, I'm gonna go pick up Rachel at the station. 

ELAINE

Yeah, see ya. 

JERRY

Okay. (He leaves) 

CAROL

Oh, just look at him! 

BEN

Yeah, he really is breathtaking. (Elaine confused by his comment) 

RACHEL

Train was so crowded. I had to sit in the seat facing the wrong way. 

JERRY

Oh I like that. It's like going back in time. (George comes outside) 

GEORGE

Hey Rachel! 

RACHEL

(Quickly gets out of seat) Hi. I'm gonna go in there to change. 

GEORGE

What kind of a greeting was that? 

JERRY

She's got greeting problems. 

GEORGE

Yeah. I love Hampton tomatoes. You know, you can eat 'em like apples. You know it's funny, the tomato never really took on as a hand fruit. 

JERRY

Well, the tomato's an anomaly. So successful with the ketchup and the sauce, but you can't find a good one. (Kramer enters with a box of lobster) 

KRAMER

Hey, hey, hey! Look at what I got! 

GEORGE

Hey! Wow, the K-Man! (They walk into the kitchen inside) 

JERRY

You got lobster for everybody? 

KRAMER

Yeah, and they're fresh! Right out of the ocean. 

GEORGE

This is fantastic. Man, what a weekend. Swimming, lobster for dinner... 

KRAMER

I know, it's great. And I saw Jane topless. (Jerry shows that 'damn' expression behind George) 

GEORGE

You saw who, what? 

KRAMER

Yeah, I saw Jane topless. Well, we all saw her. 

JERRY

(Jerry realizes the situation is hopeless) All right. 

GEORGE

You saw Jane topless? 

JERRY

Well, when you went for the tomatoes she lied out topless. 

GEORGE

Oh you mean face down on her chest. 

JERRY

No. 

GEORGE

Face up on her back? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

GEORGE

Well why'd she do that? 

KRAMER

I guess she was hot. 

GEORGE

You mean she just laid there topless? 

KRAMER

No, no, she got up, she walked around... 

GEORGE

Walked around? And you looked? 

KRAMER

Of course. She's got a great body, buddy. All right, I'm gonna go upstairs, I'll be right back. 

GEORGE

I can't believe that you saw her before me. 

JERRY

Think of me as a doctor. (They go outside again) 

GEORGE

Well, how good a look did you get? 

JERRY

Well what'd you mean? 

GEORGE

Well, if she was a criminal and you had to describe her to a police sketch artist... 

JERRY

They'd pick her up in about ten minutes. 

GEORGE

Great, great. So anytime you want you can just visualize her naked. 

JERRY

(looking of into the distance) I guess that's true... 

GEORGE

Stop it, stop it! It's not fair. It's not fair. I don't like this situation, Jerry. I don't like it one bit. 

JERRY

What do you want me to do? You wanna see Rachel naked? 

GEORGE

Yes, yes! The punishment should fit the crime. 

JERRY

You can see me naked. I can offer you that. 

GEORGE

It's like I'm Neil Armstrong. I turn around for a sip of Tang and you jump out first. 

ELAINE

Nobody ever called me breathtaking before. 

JERRY

I've never been called breathtaking either. 

ELAINE

I mean, if he thinks that that baby's breathtaking, then who's not breathtaking? 

JERRY

Maybe he just said it because the mother was in the room. 

ELAINE

Yeah, right, that's a possibility. I have to find out. 

JERRY

How are you gonna do that? 

ELAINE

I can be very clever. 

RACHEL

I'm gonna take a swim. 

ELAINE

Oh, me too. I'll meet you down. (She goes in the hall and sees George) Oh, don't go in, Rachel's getting undressed. 

GEORGE

Oh, okay. (Starts to walk other way and then walks to their room and goes in) 

RACHEL

Hey! 

GEORGE

Oh, sorry. 

RACHEL

Don't you knock? 

GEORGE

I'm sorry, uh, it's not like I'm gonna see something I've never seen before. 

JERRY

You might have. 

GEORGE

I didn't. 

JERRY

You won't. 

RACHEL

What'd you want anyway, George? 

JERRY

Yes, George. I'm kind of wondering myself. What is it what you want? 

GEORGE

No, I was just wondering... if you guys, uh, had any gum. 

JERRY

Oh! So you were swimming in the pool, and you wanted some gum. 

GEORGE

Yes, because the water was cold... and the chewing warms me up. 

RACHEL

We don't have any gum. 

GEORGE

Okay. (Chewing) Thanks anyway. (Continues to chew as he exits) 

RACHEL

Strange man. 

JERRY

Wait'll you get to know him. 

RACHEL

So where is this baby, anyway? 

JERRY

Oh, check it out. I guarantee you've never seen anything quite so objectionable. It's down the hall, third door on your left. (Rachel walks down hall, walks in on George changing out of his swimsuit) 

RACHEL

(She screams) Oh my God! I'm sorry, I thought this was the baby's room. I'm really sorry. (She exits) 

GEORGE

(realizing he was short changed) I was in the pool! I was in the pool! 

GEORGE

Did she do it on purpose? 

JERRY

It was my fault, I told her the wrong door. 

GEORGE

I was supposed to see her. She wasn't supposed to see me. 

JERRY

So what? 

GEORGE

Well ordinarily I wouldn't mind. But... 

JERRY

But... 

GEORGE

Well I just got back from swimming in the pool. And the water was cold... 

JERRY

Oh... You mean... shrinkage. 

GEORGE

Yes. Significant shrinkage. 

JERRY

So you feel you were short changed. 

GEORGE

Yes! I mean, if she thinks that's me she's under a complete misapprehension. That was not me, Jerry. That was not me. 

JERRY

Well, so what's the difference? 

GEORGE

What if she discusses it with Jane? 

JERRY

Oh, she's not gonna tell Jane. 

GEORGE

How do you know? 

JERRY

Women aren't like us. 

GEORGE

They're worse! They're much worse than us, they talk about everything! Couldn't you at least tell her about the shrinkage factor? 

JERRY

No, I'm not gonna tell her about your shrinkage. Besides, I think women know about shrinkage. 

GEORGE

How do women know about shrinkage? 

JERRY

Isn't it common knowledge? 

JERRY

(Elaine walking down the hall they notice her and wave her into the room) Elaine! Get! (She enters) 

GEORGE

Do women know about shrinkage? 

ELAINE

What do you mean, like laundry? 

GEORGE

No. 

JERRY

Like when a man goes swimming... afterwards... 

ELAINE

It shrinks? 

JERRY

Like a frightened turtle! 

ELAINE

Why does it shrink? 

GEORGE

It just does. 

ELAINE

I don't know how you guys walk around with those things. 

MICHAEL

Thanks for the lobster, Kramer. 

KRAMER

Rachel, aren't you gonna have any? 

RACHEL

Oh, no, I can't. I'm kosher, we don't eat shellfish. 

KRAMER

You mean you've never tasted lobster? 

RACHEL

No. 

KRAMER

Wow. You're so pious. I really respect that. You know when you die, you're gonna get some special attention. 

CAROL

Oh, the baby's crying. I'll go get him. He can sit with us. 

JERRY

No! 

JERRY

No, you don't wanna do that. You'll be uncomfortable. 

ELAINE

Yeah, finish eating. The baby's not gonna have any fun over here. We're-We're not fun for a baby. 

JERRY

Yeah, the lobster'll scare him. 

CAROL

I'm gonna get him. 

GEORGE

See, look at this. (wearing a very tight shirt) Rachel, my T-shirt shrunk. It used to be much bigger, and now it shrunk. You see, that's what water does. It shrinks things. 

ELAINE

Really? Tell us more, Mr. Science. (Rachel whispers in Jane's ear, which prompts Jane to laugh) 

GEORGE

What're you doing? What're you, telling secrets? What're you laughing at? 

JANE

It's nothing, George. 

GEORGE

You know, it's very impolite to tell secrets. Are you talking about me? 

JANE

What is it with you? 

JERRY

(To George) Easy big fella. 

MICHAEL

So Kramer, where'd you get all these lobster, at the Fleesher's Market? 

KRAMER

No, I got 'em in the ocean. 

MICHAEL

The ocean? What'd you mean? 

KRAMER

Well, I found this rope and I kept tugging on it, and all these lobsters came up. 

MICHAEL

Those are commercial lobster traps. You can't take those lobsters from there. That's against the law. 

KRAMER

Take it easy. There's plenty of lobsters in the ocean for everyone. 

MICHAEL

My father was a lobsterman. He got up every morning at four and came home every night stinking of brine! He sent me through law school with the lobsters he caught! (Kramer stands up from table) 

CAROL

(Entering with baby) Here he is. 

KRAMER

Ahhh! (Shocked after seeing the baby) 

ELAINE

Some night, huh? 

BEN

Yeah, I wish I had my telescope. 

ELAINE

Some dinner, huh? 

BEN

Nothing like fresh caught lobster. 

ELAINE

Some house, huh? 

BEN

It was built by Mark Fargman. He build a lot of these homes here. 

ELAINE

Some ugly baby, huh? 

BEN

What did you say? 

ELAINE

(improvising) I said, uh, some snuggly baby. 

BEN

He is something. 

ELAINE

Well, to tell you the truth, Dr. Feffa, I , I was surprised to hear you use a word like breathtaking to describe a baby, I mean, because you also used it referring to me. 

BEN

Well, you know Elaine, sometimes you say things just to be nice. (Elaine relieved, then confused, not knowing if he was being nice to her or to the baby) 

JERRY

You told her? 

RACHEL

Yeah, what's the big deal? 

JERRY

You don't understand. This organ, it's very... schizophrenic. 

RACHEL

Jerry, what the difference? You know, you're the ones obsessed with this stuff, not us. I'm sure it wouldn't matter to Jane. 

GEORGE

You're going back to New York now? 

JANE

Yeah, I have some things to do. 

GEORGE

Uh huh. Uh huh! I think you spoke to your little friend Rachel, that's what I think. 

JANE

So what if I did? 

GEORGE

And she didn't say something to you about a certain something? 

JANE

I don't know what you're talking about. 

GEORGE

*I* think that *you* think that a certain *something* is not all that it could be, when in fact it is is all that it *should* be, and *more*! 

JANE

(patronizing George) I'm sure it is. 

GEORGE

Look, you don't understand. There was shrinkage. 

KRAMER

You looking for this? (Holding up lobster) 

RACHEL

Oh, Kramer! You startled me. 

KRAMER

Well, I thought you might wind up around here. 

RACHEL

Yeah, well, I couldn't stop thinking about how everyone was enjoying the lobster so much an' well I thought I little taste wouldn't hurt, huh? 

KRAMER

No I'm afraid I couldn't do that. 

RACHEL

Why not? 

KRAMER

Well, that wouldn't be kosher. 

RACHEL

C'mon, Kramer. I really want to try it. 

KRAMER

Nah, I'm sorry, honey. Not on my watch. 

RACHEL

Come on, Kramer. 

KRAMER

Heyahhh! 

RACHEL

I just heard a car drive out. What was that? 

JERRY

Oh, that's just Jane driving home to New York in the middle of the night. (Rachel shocked) 

CAROL

George, thanks so much for making breakfast. 

ELAINE

George, these are the best scrambled eggs I've ever tasted. 

KRAMER

Ya I didn't know you could cook. 

GEORGE

Well, I'm just expressing my gratitude to our gracious host. 

BEN

Yes, George, the whole breakfast is breathtaking. (hearing this Elaine looks at him extremely annoyed) 

RACHEL

Good morning. 

ALL

Hey, hey. Morning 

RACHEL

Kramer, I just want to thank you again for last night, you really saved me. 

MICHAEL

What happened? 

RACHEL

Well, I almost tried the lobster, but Kramer stopped me. 

KRAMER

Well I knew you'd regret it for the rest of your life. 

RACHEL

You're right, I would have. 

JERRY

(Referring to George) Hey, look at this guy. 

GEORGE

A little breakfast. 

JERRY

Yeah. 

GEORGE

(To Rachel) And, uh, you eat eggs, right? 

RACHEL

Yes, I do. Thank you. 

JERRY

Geez, these are delicious. Where did you learn to make eggs like this? 

RACHEL

Umm... This is so good. 

GEORGE

Ah, enjoying them? 

RACHEL

Mm-hmm. 

GEORGE

Uh, good. You know, you might wanna try eating it with one of these. (Holds up lobster bib) 

RACHEL

There's lobster in these eggs? 

GEORGE

Not that much. You know, they tend to shrink in the water. 

JERRY

Well, I guess I gotta go, too. 

ELAINE

Well, this has turned out to be one *helluva* weekend. (Policeman knocks on door, Michael answers) 

MICHAEL

Excuse me? 

POLICE

I'm sorry to bother you, but we're trying to track down a lobster poacher that uh cleaned out on of the traps. 

KRAMER

Wonder what's goin' on. 

GEORGE

Ah, I guess I should go up and apologize. 

MICHAEL

There he is, officer. (Michael points to Kramer, Kramer waves to policeman) 

RACHEL

Ahh! Don't you ever knock? 

GEORGE

I don't know why Rachel had to drive back with Michael and Carol. 

ELAINE

Hey, if you saw me naked, I wouldn't want to ride back in the same car with you either. 

JERRY

I still can't believe Michael finked on Kramer. 

ELAINE

How is he gonna pay off a thousand dollar fine? 

JERRY

They got some sort of program. 

GEORGE

Hey, there's a tomato stand, let's stop, I can get some more. 

JERRY

Hey, isn't that Michael's car? 

ELAINE

There's Rachel. 

GEORGE

Where? (He looks out window and gets hit by a tomato) 

LIPPMAN

To your promotion. 

ELAINE

Oh, thank you! (They drink) Mmm, Oh, thank you, Mr Lippman, I can't tell you how much I appreciate this. I mean, of course I deserve it. 

LIPPMAN

Well, you're really on your way now. 

ELAINE

You really oughtta do something about that cold. 

JERRY

You got a raise? 

ELAINE

I don't fool around, (banging on the table) baby! 

JERRY

I thought you said Pendant was in financial trouble. 

ELAINE

They were, but they're being absorbed by Matsushimi, that big Japanese conglomerate. 

JERRY

Oh, when did that happen? 

ELAINE

They're signing the papers next week. 

JERRY

Does this mean they're gonna be publishing Kramer's coffee table book? 

ELAINE

Yeah, they'll definitely do it now. 

JERRY

Boy, you're on quite a streak. Job promotion, plus you're back with Jake Jarmal. 

ELAINE

Yeah, it's gettin' serious, we're talking about moving in together. 

JERRY

Boy, you really got it all, I'm sure Helen 'Girlie' Brown would be very proud of you. 

JERRY

Speaking of having it all ... Where were you? 

GEORGE

I went to the beach. (Jerry and Elaine exchange looks) 

JERRY

Oh, the beach. 

GEORGE

It's not working, Jerry. It's just not working. (sits down next to Elaine) 

JERRY

What is it that isn't working? 

GEORGE

Why did it all turn out like this for me? I had so much promise. I was personable, I was bright. (Elaine turns showing disagreement) Oh, maybe not academically speaking, (Elaine nods correct) I was perceptive. I always know when someone's uncomfortable at a party. 

JERRY

(pointing to napkins; to Elaine) Could I get napkin over there? 

GEORGE

It became very clear to me sitting out there today, that every decision I've ever made, in my entire life, has been wrong. My life is the complete opposite of everything I want it to be. Every instinct I have, in every of aspect of life, be it something to wear, something to eat ... It's all been wrong. (chuckles) Everywhere. 

GEORGE

Yeah. No, no, no, wait a minute, I always have tuna on toast. Nothing's ever worked out for me with tuna on toast. I want the complete opposite of on toast. Chicken salad, on rye, un-toasted with a side of potato salad ... and a cup of tea. (laughs) 

ELAINE

Well, there's no telling what can happen from this. 

JERRY

You know chicken salad is not the opposite of tuna, salmon is the opposite of tuna, 'cuz salmon swim against the current, (hand motion of the salmon swimming against the current) and the tuna swim with it. (hand motion of the tuna swimming with it) 

GEORGE

(annoyed) Good for the tuna. 

ELAINE

Ah, George, you know, that woman just looked at you. 

GEORGE

So what? What am I supposed to do? 

ELAINE

Go talk to her. 

GEORGE

Elaine, bald men, with no jobs, and no money, who live with their parents, don't approach strange women. 

JERRY

Well here's your chance to try the opposite. Instead of tuna salad and being intimidated by women, chicken salad and going right up to them. 

GEORGE

Yeah, I should do the opposite, I should. 

JERRY

If every instinct you have is wrong, then the opposite would have to be right. 

GEORGE

Yes, I will do the opposite. I used to sit here and do nothing, and regret it for the rest of the day, so now I will do the opposite, and I will do something! 

GEORGE

Excuse me, uh I couldn't help but notice that you were looking in my direction. 

VICTORIA

Oh, yes I was, you just ordered the same exact lunch as me. 

GEORGE

My name is George. I'm unemployed and I live with my parents. 

VICTORIA

I'm Victoria. Hi. 

JERRY

(on the phone) Are you kidding? They can't cancel that show on me now, it's too late for me to book anything else for that weekend. Alright, alright ... okay, bye. (hangs up the phone) 

KRAMER

Hey. Buddy, it's all happening! 

JERRY

What's happening? 

KRAMER

The coffee table book. It's a go-oo! 

JERRY

Oh yeah, I heard all about it. 

KRAMER

You know what this means? I'm starting the book tour. First stop : Regis and Kathy Lee. 

JERRY

You're going on Regis and Kathy Lee? 

KRAMER

Oh, you better believe it! 

JERRY

I'll loan you my puffy shirt. 

KRAMER

No, no, no. 

JERRY

What're you gonna talk about? 

KRAMER

Well, coffee tables. 

JERRY

Hello? What? Yeah, sure, I'll do it. I just had something cancelled the same weekend. Ok. Great. Bye. (hangs up the phone; turns to Kramer) You know, life is amazing. I just lost a job and five minutes later get another, same weekend, same money. 

KRAMER

You know who you are? Even Steven 

VICTORIA

Are you growing a beard? 

GEORGE

Why shave every day? It just grows right back. 

VICTORIA

I guess ... 

GEORGE

I'm afraid I'm just not interested in how I present myself. If those kind of superficialities are important to you, this probably isn't gonna work. 

VICTORIA

Hey watch, he just cut you off! Did you see that?! 

GEORGE

Take it easy. Take it easy. It's not the end of the world. 

VICTORIA

What are we gonna do? Should we just move? 

GEORGE

That won't be necessary. 

GEORGE

Shut your traps and stop kicking the seats! We're trying to watch the movie! And if I have to tell you again, we're gonna take it outside and I'm gonna show you what it's like! You understand me? Now, shut your mouths or I'll shut 'em for ya, and if you think I'm kidding, just try me. Try me. Because I would love it! 

VICTORIA

Are you sure you don't wanna come up, I mean, it's only nine thirty. 

GEORGE

I don't think we should. We really don't know each other very well. 

VICTORIA

Who are you, George Costanza? 

GEORGE

I'm the opposite of every guy you've ever met. 

MANAGER

Excuse me, is your name Elaine? 

ELAINE

Yes. 

MANAGER

Were you suposed to meet a Jake Jarmal here? 

ELAINE

Yeah. 

MANAGER

Well, I'm afraid he's been in an accident. 

ELAINE

(gasp) An accident? What happened? 

MANAGER

Well-he got side-swiped by a cab, but he's alright. He's in St.Vincent Hospital, room 907. 

ELAINE

Oh. Ok. Thank you. 

ELAINE

Could I have a box of Jujyfruits? 

COUNTERPERSON

(handing the Jujyfruits to Elaine) There you go. 

JAKE

So, then, you know, the light was clearly green, I started walking, he skidded and he went right into my hip. 

ELAINE

(With her mouth full of Jujyfruit) Oh, that is so terrible. That is so terrible, Jake. I mean, how can people be so stupid? Just sickening. 

ELAINE

You want one? 

JAKE

No thanks. 

ELAINE

So when do you think you're gonna get outta here? 

JAKE

Where did you get those? 

ELAINE

At the movies. 

JAKE

Didn't the theater manager give you the message before you went in? 

ELAINE

Yeah, he did. 

JAKE

Then when did you get those? 

ELAINE

Right after ... that ... 

JAKE

So you heard that I was in a car accident, and then decided to stop off for some Jujyfruit? 

ELAINE

Well... the counter...was right there, and... 

JAKE

I would think, under the circumstances, it would have sent you running out the building. Apparently, it didn't have any effect on you. 

ELAINE

No, no, it does! 

JAKE

(angry) If you got into a car accident, I can guarantee you I wouldn't stop for Jujyfruit! 

ELAINE

But...Jake... 

JAKE

I would like to be alone now, please. 

ELAINE

But, Jake, I didn't... 

JAKE

Goodnight! 

JERRY

(shocked) Broke even. 

REGIS

Can I bring out our next guest now? 

LEE

Please, please. 

REGIS

Young guy, he's got a new book coming out, and it's about, and this is the best part - 

LEE

I love this. 

REGIS

It's a coffee table book about coffee tables! (holds the book up for the audience) 

LEE

Yeah. Is that clever? I think that is so clever! 

REGIS

I think so too. Did you get to meet him back stage? 

LEE

I did. 

REGIS

I mean, he looks like a fun guy, doesn't he? 

LEE

I love his hair. 

REGIS

Yeah, oh, I do too. This guy could be a little bonkos. Really. Anyway, if you will, would you please welcome: Kramer! 

REGIS

(shaking Kramer's hand) Hello, Kramer is here. 

LEE

I don't know, maybe it's the hair or something! 

REGIS

Ah, well, yes Kramer. So, a coffee table book about coffee tables. Where did you come up with this idea? 

KRAMER

Yeah, well, ah, I'll tell you, uh Regis... actually, this is a true story. I umm I was skiing at the time. 

REGIS

You know, when I'm skiing, Kramer, I'm trying not to kill myself, you're writing books! 

KRAMER

Yeah, well, now you kids don't go out and try that. You stay in school! 

LEE

Have you always had an interest in coffee tables, because, really, I-I love coffee tables, and I-I thought I was the only one. 

KRAMER

You see the beauty of my book is, if you don't have a coffee table, it turns into a coffee table. 

LEE

Is that fabulous? 

REGIS

Look at this! 

LEE

Is that fabulous? 

REGIS

Fabulous! 

LEE

I want one of these. 

REGIS

Did I tell you this guy was bonkos? 

LEE

This coffee table (book) is full of pictures of celebrities' coffee tables. 

KRAMER

That's true. That's right. 

REGIS

Yeah? Well, I'm not in there. Where's mine? 

KRAMER

Oh, it's on file, right here. (points to his head) 

REGIS

I'm tellin' ya, this guy's bonkos! He really is! 

LEE

But he's adorable. 

REGIS

Ya he is, he's a nice looking guy. 

LEE

It's all over my dress. 

REGIS

We'll be right back in a moment. 

JERRY

So it's all over? 

ELAINE

Yeah, it got pretty nasty. 

JERRY

And what did you go back for? Jujyfruit? 

ELAINE

It's not like I went across the street. I bought the Jujyfruit and I got in a cab. 

JERRY

Why didn't you eat it in the cab? 

ELAINE

Because I got popcorn too, and I ate that first. 

ELAINE

What's all this? 

JERRY

Played cards last night. 

ELAINE

Oh yeah? How'd you do? 

JERRY

Broke even. 

ELAINE

You always break even. 

JERRY

Yeah, I know; like yesterday I lost a job, and then I got another one, and then I missed a TV show, and later on they re-ran it. And then today I missed a train, went outside and caught a bus. It never fails! I always even out! 

ELAINE

Do you have twenty bucks? 

JERRY

What for? 

ELAINE

Just gimme twenty bucks. 

JERRY

(shocked) What the hell was that? 

ELAINE

Let's see if you get the twenty bucks back. 

JERRY

You know you could've thrown a pencil out the window and seen if that came back. 

ELAINE

You know, things were going so good for me, you know, I got the job promotion, we were talking about moving in together - 

JERRY

Well, maybe next time someone's in a car accident you won't stop off for candy first. 

GEORGE

Hey, I just found twenty dollars! I tell you this, something is happening in my life. I did this opposite thing last night. Up was down, black was white, good was - 

JERRY

Bad. 

GEORGE

Day was - 

ELAINE

Night. 

GEORGE

Yes! 

JERRY

So you just did the opposite of everything? 

GEORGE

Yes. And listen to this, listen to this; her uncle works for the Yankees and he's gonna get me a job interview. A front office kind of thing. Assistant to the traveling secretary. A job with the New York Yankees! This has been the dream of my life ever since I was a child, and it's all happening because I'm completely ignoring every urge towards common sense and good judgment I have had. This is no longer just some crazy notion. Elaine, Jerry, this is my religion. 

JERRY

So I guess your Messiah would be the Anti-Christ. 

GEORGE

Yes funny (laughs; hand clap) let's go. 

JERRY

Elaine ... look! A twenty! 

ELAINE

(not wanting to believe it) Oh my God. 

KRAMER

Hey boss. 

LIPPMAN

Kramer. Come in. 

KRAMER

How're you doin' there, big guy? (Puts his arm around the tobacco store Indian) 

LIPPMAN

Uh, Ya, Have a seat. 

KRAMER

Al-righty (sits down) Have you got yourself a cold? 

KRAMER

Woah, that's quite a honk! 

LIPPMAN

Ya, thank you. 

KRAMER

Get yourself some vitamin C with rose hips and bioflavenoids. 

LIPPMAN

The reason I asked you in here, is I-I caught your appearance on uh 'Regis and Kathy Lee' the other day and - 

KRAMER

Ya that was pretty good, huh? 

LIPPMAN

An-Anyway, the thinking here is that it would be best i-if you uh didn't do any more of these shows. 

KRAMER

Because of the coffee thing? 

LIPPMAN

Kramer, I'm sorry. 

KRAMER

What about 'Sonia Live'? Now you're not cancelling 'Sonia Live'? 

LIPPMAN

It's out - 

KRAMER

She's a doctor, I got a thing for her. 

LIPPMAN

Kra-Kramer, I - 

CUSHMAN

Why don't you tell me about some of your previous work experience? 

GEORGE

Alrighty. Ah ... my last job was in publishing ... I uh got fired for having sex in my office with the cleaning woman. 

CUSHMAN

Go on. 

GEORGE

Ah, Alright, before that, I was in real estate. I quit, because the boss wouldn't let me use his private bathroom. That was it. 

CUSHMAN

Do you talk to everybody like this? 

GEORGE

Of course. 

CUSHMAN

My niece told me you were different. 

GEORGE

I am different, yeah. 

CUSHMAN

I gotta tell ya, you are the complete opposite of every applicant we've seen. (gets out of his chair) Ah, Mr. Steinbrenner, sir. There's someone here I'd like you to meet. (George gets up and goes over) This is Mr. Costanza. He's one of the applicants. 

STEINBRENNER

Nice to meet you. 

GEORGE

Well, I wish I could say the same, but I must say, with all due respect, I find it very hard to see the logic behind some of the moves you have made with this fine organization. In the past twenty years you have caused myself, and the city of New York, a good deal of distress, as we have watched you take our beloved Yankees and reduced them to a laughing stock, all for the glorification of your massive ego! 

STEINBRENNER

Hire this man! 

SECRETARY

Tina Robbins is here to see you. 

MAN

Who's that? 

ELAINE

Ah, it's my ex-roommate, she moved out four years ago, I-I've been sub-letting my apartment from her. 

MAN

Alright, see ya. (Meets Tina in the door) Hey. 

TINA

Please. 

ELAINE

Hi Tina. 

TINA

Hi Elaine. 

ELAINE

So, I haven't seen you in a while. 

TINA

Elaine, we have a problem. 

ELAINE

Well, what is it? 

TINA

You're getting kicked out. 

ELAINE

Kicked out?! Why?! 

TINA

Well, there's been a number of complaints. 

ELAINE

Yeah? Like what? 

TINA

Well, like last Thanksgiving you buzzed up a jewel thief. 

ELAINE

Ah, I didn't know who he was! 

TINA

That's why there's a buzzer. 

ELAINE

What else? 

TINA

Well, apparently, the week after that, you buzzed up some Jehova's Witnesses and they couldn't get them out of the building. 

ELAINE

What else have you got? 

TINA

Well, let's see. (Takes out a list from her bag) 

JERRY

I'll tell you what the big advantage of homosexuality is. If you're going out with someone your size, right there you double your wardrobe. 

RACHEL

I suppose... 

JERRY

Oh, come on, that's a huge feature. When they approach a new recruit, I'm sure that's one of the big selling points. 

RACHEL

(sighs) Jerry ... 

JERRY

Yes? 

RACHEL

I've been doing a lot of thinking. 

JERRY

Uh huh? 

RACHEL

Well, I don't think we should see each other any more. 

JERRY

Oh, that's okay. 

RACHEL

(confused) What? 

JERRY

Nah, that's fine. No problem. I'll meet somebody else. 

RACHEL

You will? 

JERRY

Sure. See, things always even out for me. 

RACHEL

Huh? 

JERRY

It's fine. Anyway, it's been really nice dating you for a while. And uh good luck! 

RACHEL

Yeah, you too. 

JERRY

(leaving; singing) She'll be coming around the mountain... 

JERRY

The New York Yankees?! 

GEORGE

The New York Yankees! 

JERRY

Ruth, Gehrig, DiMaggio, Mantle ... Costanza? 

GEORGE

I'm the assistant to the travelling secretary. I'm going on the road trips with 'em! I'll be on the plane... I'm working in Yankee Stadium! This is a dream, I'm busting, Jerry, I'm busting! 

JERRY

I can't believe it. 

GEORGE

Ya! 

JERRY

Ya? 

ELAINE

(on buzzer) It's me. 

JERRY

(buzzes Elaine up) Come on up. 

GEORGE

And I'm moving out of my parents' house, I'm taking that apartment on 86th street, remember the one we saw? 

JERRY

That's a great place! 

GEORGE

I'm back in business, baby! 

JERRY

George, I wouldn't get too excited about this stuff, you know, things have a way of evening out. 

GEORGE

Hey! (to Elaine, who doesn't look too cheerful) 

JERRY

Hi Elaine. 

ELAINE

Hi. 

JERRY

How're things going? 

ELAINE

How're things going? You wanna know how things are going? I'll tell you how things are going. I am getting kicked out of my apartment! 

JERRY

Why? Why are they doing that? 

ELAINE

I don't know! They have a list of grievances. 

JERRY

The jewel thief? 

ELAINE

Yeah, the jewel thief. 

JERRY

What else? 

ELAINE

I put Canadian quarters in the washing machine. (disappointed) I gotta be out by the end of the month. 

GEORGE

Well, you could move in with my parents. (chuckles) 

ELAINE

Was that the ... opposite ... of what you were going to say, or was that just your natural instinct? (She squeezes George's mouth between her fingers) 

GEORGE

Instinct. 

ELAINE

Stick ... with the opposite. (Slaps George on the forehead) 

JERRY

Elaine, don't get too down. Everything'll even out, see, I have two friends, you were up, (has his one hand up and his other hand down) he was down. Now he's up, (switches the positioning of his hands) you're down. You see how it all evens out for me? 

SECRETARY

Mr. Lippman, the people from Matsushimi are here. 

LIPPMAN

Oh ya alright... tell them I'll be right there. (tosses his handkerchief on Elaine's desk so he can tie his shoe) Oh man well, this is it, Elaine. You know, without this merger, we'd be out on the street. Boy, they sure saved us. 

ELAINE

(noticing the forgotten handkerchief tries to stop call for Mr. Lippman with a mouth full of jujifruit) Oh, Mr. Lippman you forgot your handkerchief. Mr. Lippman, you forgot your handkerchief. It's on my desk. 

CHAIRMAN

(noticing Mr. Lippman in the hallway) Ah Lippman son. (Lippman smiles and is forced to enter his office) Lippman son. (speaks some Japanese) 

INTERPRETER

Mr Lippman, it is with great pride that we undertake this partnership with your company. 

LIPPMAN

I ... I'm sorry, I can't shake your hand right now. It's germs. 

JERRY

Is that the end of it? 

GEORGE

Yeah, it's the last one. 

JERRY

Alright. 

ESTELLE

I can't believe you're moving out. (Grabs Kramer) Kramer, is this true? Is it really happening? It's ... it's like a dream. 

KRAMER

Oh, it's true. 

GEORGE

Alright, let's go. 

FRANK

Don't get in trouble with the Yankees. You be nice. (Slaps George's forehead) 

GEORGE

I'm not gonna be nice. That's how I got the job. 

ESTELLE

Jerry, did you hear this? 

JERRY

He knows what he's doing. 

GEORGE

I just want the both of you to know how much you mean to me, and I love you both very, very much. 

JERRY

Opposite. 

ELAINE

I must've had at least eight in my mouth. I couldn't talk. I couldn't talk! 

JERRY

Why'd you have to eat so many? 

ELAINE

Because they're Jujyfruit. I like them. I didn't know it would start a chain reaction that would lead to the end of Pendant Publishing. 

JERRY

Not to mention the end of Kramer's coffee table book. 

KRAMER

Yeah, you knew he had a cold. How'd you expect him to blow his nose? YEA! 

ELAINE

Do you know what's going on here? Can't you see what's happened? I've become George. 

JERRY

Don't say that. 

ELAINE

It's true. I'm George! I'm George! 

GEORGE

Greetings, people. Greetings. Greetings and salutations. What a beautiful day for a ball game. Let's play two! (Sits down, says to waitress :) Oh, I'll have the chicken salad on rye, my usual, you know what I get, darlin'. (Turns to the Gang) So, let's see, I had a little conversation today with Mr Don Mattingly - (to Elaine) he's the first base man. 

ELAINE

Uh huh. 

GEORGE

We talked about his new batting stance, you know, I'm not crazy about it, but I said , 'Donny, go with it 'till it stops workin'.' Donny baseball. He's a helluva guy. 

KRAMER

Wait, wait, wait, that's too much. Mine was more than yours. 

JERRY

Ah ... let's call it even. 

GEORGE

O.K., Danny, take a swing. (Tartabull swings the bat.) N-No! No! No! You're opening up your shoulder. 

TARTABULL

Really? 

GEORGE

No, not really. I'm just saying this to you because I like to hear myself talk. Yes, really! 

TARTABULL

Alright, alright. 

GEORGE

What are all sweatin' for? 

TARTABULL

It's hot in this uniform. 

GEORGE

Hot? (Feels Tartabull's material.) What is this? 

TARTBULL

What is what? 

GEORGE

This uniform, what's it made from? 

TARTBULL

I don't know, cotton? 

GEORGE

No. This is not cotton. Here, lemme see. (Tries to look at the tag on the uniform. Tartabull gets creeped out and resists.) Will you stop it? (Looks at the tag.) Oh. Of course. Polyester! 

TARTABULL

So? 

GEORGE

I can't believe you're not playing in cotton. 

TARTABULL

Well, this is what they give us. 

GEORGE

You know they used to make leisure suits out of this fabric? 

TARTABULL

You really think cotton's better? 

GEORGE

Of course! Alright, maybe I'll say something to Buck. 

TARTABULL

Yeah, good idea. Catch ya later. (Leaves.) 

GEORGE

Hey, don't embarrass me today. I got some friends in the stands. (George makes a swinging motion with an imaginary bat and pulls something in his back.) 

VENDOR

Hot dogs here! Yankee franks! 

ELAINE

Oh, you want one? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

ELAINE

I'll get it. (Reaches in her bag for money.) 

JERRY

That's alright, I got it. 

ELAINE

Jerry! 

JERRY

Elaine, stop it. 

ELAINE

Hey, just because I'm not working doesn't mean I haven't got any money. (To vendor) Yo! Dogs! Two! 

JERRY

I'm sorry. 

SYSTEM

Your attention please...the New York Yankees would like to welcome Miss Connecticut, Miss Rhode Island and Miss North Dakota, all of whom will be competing in the Miss America pageant this weekend in Atlantic City. (The three contestants make their way to their seats, right across the aisle from Jerry and Elaine.) 

JERRY

Now, there's a career path you may have overlooked. 

ELAINE

Ooh, I gotta check my machine. I'm waiting to hear about an interview. Doubleday is looking for somebody to replace Jackie Onassis. 

JERRY

Oh, she worked at Doubleday...? 

ELAINE

Yeah, she was an editor. 

JERRY

Right, just like you. 

ELAINE

Yeah. Can you hold my seat? (Elaine gets up.) 

CROWD

Hey! Down in front! (Elaine clambers over Jerry and exits.) 

JERRY

Hot dog? 

ISLAND

No, thanks. I'm watching my weight. 

JERRY

Ah. I'm watching my height. My doctor doesn't want me to get any taller. So you're Miss, uh... 

ISLAND

Rhode Island. 

JERRY

I was almost Mr. Coffee. They felt I was a little too relaxed. (Miss Rhode Island laughs.) 

GEORGE

Miss Rhode Island? When are you seeing her? 

JERRY

Tonight. I have to call her, she's staying in a hotel. 

GEORGE

You're incredible. 

JERRY

And get this - I'm working in Atlantic City this weekend, and she's going to be down there for the pageant. 

GEORGE

What if she becomes Miss America? You could be dating Miss America, Jerry! 

JERRY

The only bad thing is, we have to go out with a chaperone. 

GEORGE

Chaperone? What, are you kidding? 

JERRY

No, it's part of the contest rules. 

GEORGE

What does the chaperone do? 

JERRY

I don't know, she just sits there. 

GEORGE

Can she talk? 

JERRY

I'm not sure if she's allowed to talk. (Picks up the phone and dials.) 

GEORGE

You're calling her? 

JERRY

Yeah. (sings) There she is...Miss - yes, room 417 please? Karen Hanson? 

GEORGE

Hey, did you know that the Yankees don't wear cotton jerseys? 

JERRY

Of course, they're polyester. 

GEORGE

Well, what is that? That's a crime! Do you know how hot those things get? They should be wearing cotton. 

JERRY

Why do they wear polyester? 

GEORGE

I don't know. That's all gonna change. 

JERRY

You're going to do something about it? 

GEORGE

Why shouldn't I? 

JERRY

No reason... 

LANDIS

Of course, Jackie O. was a great lady. Those are going to be some tough shoes to fill. Everyone loved her. She had such...grace. 

ELAINE

Yes! Grace! 

LANDIS

Not many people have grace. 

ELAINE

Well, you know, grace is a tough one. I like to think I have a little grace...not as much as Jackie - 

LANDIS

You can't have 'a little grace.' You either have grace, or you...don't. 

ELAINE

O.K., fine, I have...no grace. 

LANDIS

And you can't acquire grace. 

ELAINE

Well, I have no intention of 'getting' grace. 

LANDIS

Grace isn't something you can pick up at the market. 

ELAINE

Alright, alright, look - I don't have grace, I don't want grace...I don't even say grace, O.K.? 

LANDIS

Thank you for coming in. 

ELAINE

Yeah, yeah, right. 

LANDIS

We'll make our choice in a few days, and we'll let you know. 

ELAINE

I have no chance, do I? 

LANDIS

No. (They shake hands.) 

INTERCOM

Justin Pitt to see you. 

ELAINE

Justin Pitt? 

LANDIS

He was a very close friend of Mrs. Onassis's. 

ELAINE

'Mrs. Onassis's'? That's hard to pronounce. 

LANDIS

Excuse me? 

ELAINE

Nothing. (Mr. Pitt comes in with some papers in hand.) 

PITT

Mrs. Landis, there's something wrong with this copying machine, it's all coming out slanted. Now, I don't know if this is your department or not. 

LANDIS

Justin Pitt, this is Elaine Benes. (Elaine turns around. With sunglasses and a scarf on her head, she bears a close resemblance to Jackie O.) 

PITT

Charmed. 

ELAINE

I was a great admirer of Mrs. Onass-sis-sis-sis... 

JERRY

Hello, Karen? It's Jerry Seinfeld. Oh, that's very sweet of you. You know, you better be careful, you don't want to get too congenial. They'll slap that 'Miss Congeniality' on you, and you'll congene yourself right out of the contest. So, what time do you want to get together later? What? So what, we don't need the chaperone. (To George) The chaperone can't make it. (To Karen) Oh, you're not gonna get disqualified! So, we're not going? (Kramer enters.) Hold on one second. (To Kramer) Hey, what are you doing tonight? 

KRAMER

Nothin.' 

JERRY

I'm going out with one of the Miss America contestants, you wanna go? 

KRAMER

What state? 

JERRY

Rhode Island. 

KRAMER

They're never in contention. 

GEORGE

How do you know? 

KRAMER

Because I've seen every Miss America pageant since I was six. 

JERRY

Look, do you want to go or not? I'll buy you dinner. 

KRAMER

Giddy-up! 

JERRY

I think I got someone! 

PITT

The resemblance is uncanny. (Elaine, sipping soda through a straw, looks up with a sour expression on her face.) Even the brown eyes. 

ELAINE

Well, a lot of people have brown eyes. 

PITT

No, there's something else. An indefinable quality. 

ELAINE

Grace? 

PITT

Grace, yes. 

ELAINE

You think Ihave grace? 

PITT

Some grace, yes. 

ELAINE

Just some? 

PITT

Well, you don't want too much grace or you won't be able to stand. 

ELAINE

Oh, Mr. Pitt. 

PITT

Elaine, I want you to come and work for me as my personal assistant. Now, I'll pay you the same as Pendant, but I would need you to start right away. 

GEORGE

Hey, Buck. Talk to you for a second? 

SHOWALTER

Sure, George. 

GEORGE

How's everything going? Everything O.K.? 

SHOWALTER

Well, all of a sudden there's a problem with Tartabull's swing... 

GEORGE

Listen, Buck, I uh...obviously I don't need to talk to you about the importance of player morale, but uh...I've been talking to some of the guys, and some of them - I don't want to mention any names - but some of them...they're not too happy with the polyester uniforms. 

SHOWALTER

How so? 

GEORGE

Well, they get very hot in the polyester. You know, it's not a natural fibre. I think they would prefer cotton. 

SHOWALTER

Cotton, huh? 

GEORGE

Yeah. Cotton breathes, you see, it's much softer. Imagine playing games and your team is five degrees cooler than the other team. Don't you think that would be an advantage? They're cooler, they're more comfortable...they're happier - they're gonna play better. 

SHOWALTER

You may have something there, George. 

GEORGE

Oh - I've got something. 

SHOWALTER

Hmm. Cotton uniforms. 

JERRY

Congratulations! 

ELAINE

Yeah! And the best part is, I still get to look for work in publishing. 

JERRY

Now, what is it that you do, exactly? 

ELAINE

I attend to his personal affairs. 

JERRY

Like what? 

ELAINE

Well, like tomorrow for example, I have to uh...I have to buy him some socks. 

JERRY

Really! Socks! 

ELAINE

Yeah. White ones. Like the ones you wear with sneakers. 

JERRY

Hey, maybe you can pick me up some underwear! (Kramer enters.) 

KRAMER

So, what do you think? Does this work? 

JERRY

Listen...tonight, after we finish eating, you make like you got something else to do and just 'recede into the night,' if you know what I mean. 

KRAMER

No way! 

JERRY

What? 

KRAMER

Look, if you think I'm just going to step aside and do nothing while you defile this woman, you're crazy. 

JERRY

I'm not going to 'defile' her! 

KRAMER

That's right, because I'm going to see it doesn't happen. Look, Jerry, these girls are Miss America contestants. It's every little girl's dream. And I'm not going to let you trample that dream and make a mockery of everything the pageant stands for. 

JERRY

But - 

KRAMER

AAAH! No buts! Those are my rules. 

JERRY

But wait a minute... 

KRAMER

Now, if you want to go out and have some good, wholesome fun with a nice girl, I'd be glad to help you out...if you're looking for something more than that, you've got the wrong guy, buddy! (Jerry tries to get a word in during this entire speech, but Kramer won't budge an inch.) 

KRAMER

If you were Miss America, what would you do to make the world a better place? 

KAREN

As Miss America, I would try and bring an end to world hunger. If every person sacrificed one meal a week, there would be enough to feed the whole world! 

JERRY

That's a hell of a plan. (To Kramer) Listen - 

KRAMER

What advice would you give young people? 

JERRY

Alright, Kramer! 

KRAMER

This is important stuff! She's got to be able to answer these questions. She's not going to have time to think, out there, with millions of people watching her. Any hesitation could cost her the crown. You know, poise counts. 

KAREN

You really know a lot about this, don't you? 

KRAMER

Oh yeah, like last year? Miss Texas? Now, she should have won easily, but she lost points in the swimsuit competition. 

KAREN

Well, what could she have done? 

KRAMER

Tape her breasts together. (Jerry is shocked.) 

KAREN

What else? 

KRAMER

Well, take you for example. Now, you're very attractive, but you got a big waist. 

JERRY

Hey, come on! 

KAREN

No, no...it's O.K. (To Kramer) Go on. 

KRAMER

Well, I'd recommend a waist cincher. 

KAREN

Really. 

KRAMER

Oh, yeah. Just - thip! - suck you in. 

JERRY

I'll be right back. (Leaves the table.) 

KRAMER

So, what's your talent? 

KAREN

Magic. 

KRAMER

Mmm. I'm thinking of a number from one to ten. 

KAREN

Six. 

KRAMER

No, five. But you were close. 

KRAMER

How's your evening? 

KAREN

Well, I'm wearing this red dress - 

KRAMER

Stop right there. 

KAREN

No good? 

KRAMER

Disaster. 

KAREN

Why? 

KRAMER

Well, you got brown eyes. You want to wear a green dress. 

KAREN

That makes sense. (The limo stops at Karen's hotel.) 

JERRY

Well, here we are... 

KAREN

Kramer, would you consider being my personal consultant for the pageant? 

KRAMER

Okay. But if I'm going to do this, we play by my rules or we don't play at all. 

KAREN

I am in your hands. (They shake hands.) Well! Oh, good night, Jerry. (They're about to kiss, but Kramer stops them by clearing his throat.) Kenneth will take you home. (She gets out, leaving Jerry staring at Kramer with an angry expression on his face.) 

KRAMER

Hey. 

JERRY

Well, if it isn't Mr. Blackwell. 

KRAMER

Oh, come on. 

JERRY

And that waist cincher, that was the topper! 

KRAMER

Oh, you're poo-pooing! 

JERRY

Yes, I poo-poo. 

KRAMER

Well, let me tell you something. I'm taking this kid to the top. To the top, Jerry! We're going for the crown, and you can't stop her! 

JERRY

I don't want to stop her! 

KRAMER

You can't stop her, Jerry! Oh, I've seen 'em come and go, but this kid has got something! (Turns to leave.) 

JERRY

Yeah, so do you. (George enters with a newspaper.) 

GEORGE

Well, did you see it? 

JERRY

See what? 

GEORGE

The uniforms! Did you see how they played? Listen to these comments! (reads from the paper) 'Wade Boggs: 'What a fabric! Finally we can breathe.' Luis Palonia: 'Cotton is king.' Paul O'Neill: 'I never dreamed anything could be so soft and fluffy.' ' 

JERRY

Boy, they really do sound comfortable. 

GEORGE

Hey, where ya goin'? 

JERRY

I'm working in Atlantic City. 

GEORGE

Really! 

JERRY

Yeah. Hey, you're not working this weekend, why don't you come down? 

GEORGE

Atlantic City? (thinks) Yes! Yes! I will go to Atlantic City. I'm in. I'm down. 

JERRY

You know what, maybe Elaine wants to go too, lemme call her. (Picks up the phone.) She's at Mr. Pitt's, I think I got the number... 

ELAINE

So, what do you think? 

PITT

No. 

ELAINE

You don't like them? 

PITT

No, I don't like them. 

ELAINE

What's wrong? 

PITT

They're too tight. 

ELAINE

Too tight? 

PITT

There's no elastic, you need to pull too much (pulls them up more). 

ELAINE

I think they look good! 

PITT

They're cutting off the circulation. 

ELAINE

Alright, well, I'll just take them back. (The phone rings.) 

PITT

Hello? 

JERRY

Hi, Mr. Pitt! Is Elaine there? 

PITT

It's for you. 

ELAINE

Sorry. Hello? 

JERRY

Hey Elaine, it's me. 

ELAINE

Jerry? 

JERRY

We're going to Atlantic City. 

ELAINE

Really? When? 

JERRY

Today, right now! Are you in? 

ELAINE

One second, hang on. (To Mr. Pitt) Excuse me, Mr. Pitt? Would it be alright if I got you the socks tomorrow? 

PITT

Tomorrow? 

ELAINE

Yes. 

PITT

But I was hoping for my new socks today! 

ELAINE

Well, it's just one more day. 

PITT

I'm sorry. I must have them today. 

ELAINE

I can't go. 

JERRY

Why not? 

ELAINE

Because I have to return the socks and get different ones. 

PITT

Elaine! 

ELAINE

I gotta go. (Hangs up.) 

KRAMER

No. Alright, watch me now. (Karen sits on the bed. Kramer walks across the room like a Miss America contestant with a big smile on his face.) Turn, back, head up, shoulders back...posture. You see? Posture. 

KAREN

Yes, I see. O.K. 

KRAMER

Let's try a few more questions, alright? (Karen stands up.) If you were Miss America, and the U.S. was on the brink of a nuclear war, and the only way the conflict could be averted was if you agreed to sleep with the enemy's leader, what would you do? 

KAREN

Kramer, are these questions really that important...? 

KRAMER

Yes, they're important! If you stumble, if you hesitate, you can kiss the crown goodbye. Now if I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times - poise counts! It's just as important as the others. Swimsuit! Evening wear! Talent! POISE! 

GEORGE

Hey. 

JERRY

Hey. 

GEORGE

How was the show? 

JERRY

Good. How was the roulette? 

GEORGE

I won fifty bucks! Boy, this is great. Too bad Elaine's not here. 

JERRY

Yeah, all she had to do was buy Mr. Pitt a pair of socks! 

PITT

It's good, but... 

ELAINE

But what?? 

PITT

Ultimately I don't think they'll stay up. 

ELAINE

No, no! They'll stay up! 

PITT

For a while, yes, but not in the long run. 

ELAINE

But that's why I got you the tighter ones! (Holds them up.) 

PITT

Oh, forget about those! (Takes the socks from Elaine and throws them on the floor.) Why do you keep mentioning those? 

ELAINE

What do you want!? 

PITT

I want a decent sock that's comfortable, that will stay on my foot!! 

JERRY

What the hell is that? 

GEORGE

I don't know, it sounds like pigeons or something! 

JERRY

Well, I can't sleep with that noise. 

GEORGE

Me either. Is there anything you can do to shut them up? 

JERRY

Wait a second. (Grabs the icebucket off the counter.) This'll scare 'em off. (Dumps the bucket of water over the balcony. We hear a loud squawking noise and the flapping of wings, then the noise is gone. Jerry gets back into bed.) Well, good night, Ollie. 

GEORGE

Good night, Stan. 

KRAMER

What is it? 

KAREN

My doves! They're dead! I trained those birds for eight years! How am I supposed to do my magic act now? 

KRAMER

How did this happen? 

KAREN

They like it outside, so I kept them in a cage on the terrace...then I found them dead in a pool of water! 

KRAMER

Well, how did this happen? 

KAREN

It must have been an accident. 

KRAMER

Accident? This was no accident. These doves were murdered. 

KRAMER

Well, that's it! She's out of the pageant! 

JERRY

What? Why? What happened? 

KRAMER

Her birds are dead. 

JERRY

Birds? 

KRAMER

Yeah, birds. She's got these trained doves, she does this magic act, that was her talent for the pageant. You know what I think, Jerry? I think somebody murdered those doves. Somebody wanted her out of that contest bad. Somebody who was just eaten up with jealousy. Somebody who just couldn't stand to have the spotlight taken off of them! (Kramer turns around and notices the empty icebucket on the edge of Jerry's balcony.) 

JERRY

What are you looking at? (Kramer goes out onto the terrace and looks down.) Oh, that! We had to leave that outside, last night, because the water was making the room too cold. 

KRAMER

You killed them, didn't you? 

JERRY

No, you don't understand - it's not what you think! It was an accident! 

KRAMER

Well, don't think you've won, because you haven't! This kid is a fighter! And if you think I'm gonna let a couple of dead birds get in our way, you're crazy! 

JERRY

Kramer, you gotta explain to her what happened...! (Kramer exits.) 

GEORGE

What was that all about? 

JERRY

Oh, it was just Kramer...apparently I killed Miss Rhode Island's doves with a bucket of water last night. 

GEORGE

Oh. (Goes back into the bathroom.) 

KAREN

O.K., this is it! 

KRAMER

How ya feelin'? 

KAREN

I'm a little nervous! 

KRAMER

There's nothing to be nervous about. 

KAREN

But I've never sung before in my life! 

PHILBIN

And now, let's welcome Karen Ann Hanson, Miss Rhode Island! 

JERRY

I heard those doves were really incredible. 

GEORGE

That's a shame. (Karen is shown singing off-key on the television.) 

JERRY

It's like watching an animal get tortured. 

GEORGE

Hey, hey! Yankee game! (Changes the channel.) 

JERRY

Oh, great! Alright. (We hear the announcers calling the game.) 

JERRY

That's a shame. 

KRAMER

Poise. Poise! 

STATIONER

May I help you? 

ELAINE

Yeah, uh, I'm looking for a Rollamech 1000 mechanical pencil. 

STATIONER

Oh, I know the Rollamech 1000. 

ELAINE

No, I'm sure you do. 

STATIONER

They're pretty expensive. 

ELAINE

Well, it's for my boss. 

STATIONER

What do you do? 

STATIONER

Well, we don't have any in stock right now but I would be happy to order it for you. Just give me your phone number and when it comes in I'll give you a call. You're name is? 

ELAINE

Elaine. 

STATIONER

Elaine, . . . and your last name? 

ELAINE

It's just Elaine, like Cher. Ha ha ha 

STATIONER

And your number? 

ELAINE

Uh, aw, KL5-239O. 

STATIONER

Okay. Thanks a lot. You'll be hearing from me. 

ELAINE

Okay, (to Jerry)&nbsp; Move&nbsp; along. . . 

JERRY

Why did you give him MY number? 

ELAINE

I think he's got ideas. 

JERRY

I wonder if any woman ever said that about Einstein? 

JERRY

Call me when the pencil comes in Okay? 

ELAINE

Just call me when the new pen comes in, okay? 

JERRY

Why does Mr. Pitt prefer a pencil to a pen anyway? Hey. Look who's here. 

GEORGE

Hey, hey. 

ELAINE

Hey hey 

JULIE

Hi Jerry. 

JERRY

Hi Julie. 

GEORGE

Elaine, Julie. 

ELAINE

Hi. 

JULIE

Hi. 

JULIE

Oh, hi.&nbsp; Elaine's my middle name. 

ELAINE

Oh, mine's 'Ike'. 

GEORGE

Hey, wanna get some lunch? 

JERRY

Just had a big bowl of Kix. 

GEORGE

Ah, well, that's very mature. What about you? 

ELAINE

Ah, no. 

JULIE

Please come, Elaine. 

ELAINE

No, no. How about if you bring me back something? 

GEORGE

Sure, all right, what do you want? 

ELAINE

Um, hum, I don't know.. . . A big salad? 

GEORGE

What big salad? I'm going to the coffee shop. 

ELAINE

They have big salads. 

GEORGE

I've never seen a big salad. 

ELAINE

They have a big salad. 

GEORGE

Is that what I ask for? The BIG salad? 

ELAINE

It's okay, you don't... 

GEORGE

No, no, Hey I'll get it. What's in the BIG salad? 

JERRY

Big lettuce, big carrots, tomatoes like volleyballs. 

GEORGE

(???), we'll see you in a little while. 

ELAINE

Maybe I should just get married. 

JERRY

Dating is really starting to get embarrassing isn't it? 

ELAINE

I know. You know, whenever I'm on a date I feel people can tell. 

JERRY

People on dates shouldn't even be allowed out in public. 

ELAINE

You can say that again. 

JERRY

It's embarrassing for them. It's painful for us to watch. I'm going out with someone later, I'm not even taking her out of the house. 

ELAINE

Good for you. 

JERRY

I don't need a bunch of people staring at us. 

ELAINE

Right on baby. (???) 

JERRY

What was that? 

KRAMER

That Gendason, what a jerk. I'm never playing golf with him again. 

ELAINE

Who Gendason? 

KRAMER

Steve Gendason. 

ELAINE

Why is that name familiar? 

ELAINE

Oh, how did you end up playing golf with him? 

KRAMER

Well, I met him on the course a couple of years ago. Yeah. Played with him a lot. But today was it! We're on the fifteenth hole, ya, he's beating me by a couple of strokes. Then, he's about to hit his second shot, when, he picks up the ball and CLEANS it. 

ELAINE

So what? 

KRAMER

Umph, sorry! But the rules clearly state that you cannot clean the ball unless it's on the green. The rules are very clear about that. 

JERRY

Certainly are. 

KRAMER

Ya, so I penalized him a stroke. 

KRAMER

He LOST IT! We almost came to blows. We were face to face like a manager and an umpire like this . . kara a pukka ba ya ka ba . . . 

JERRY

All right. You're in MY face. 

ELAINE

I still don't see what the big deal is. 

KRAMER

A rule is a rule. And let's face it. Without rules there's chaos. 

JULIE

I like Anna Quindlen's column and Safire. Don't you like Safire? 

GEORGE

Oh, Safire. Uh ha 

JULIE

Although at times can be rather pedantic. 

GEORGE

He can be pedantic. He can be pedantic. 

JULIE

And Bob Herbert's great. He's the Daily News. 

GEORGE

Yes. Yes. You know what's interesting. The quarterback for the Atlanta Falcons is Bobby Hebert. No 'r' which I find fascinating. You know it's Herbert h-e-r-b-e-r-t, Hebert h-e-b-e-r-t. 'Hebert' it's a fun name to pronounce. Try and say it Hebert. Take a shot. All right. (check arrives) All right. I 

JULIE

No, no. I'd like to take you out. 

GEORGE

No, Julie, Julie, don't insult me. You know, what difference does it make who pays for lunch. It's totally meaningless. 

JULIE

Okay, thanks, George. 

JULIE

Oh, thank you. 

JERRY

(on phone) Hello. No she's not here. Okay, fine, whatever. I'll tell her. Okay. Goodbye. The stationery store guy called to say he ORDERED your pencil. 

ELAINE

I told ya'. He has ideas. 

JERRY

He doesn't even care if a man answers. 

ELAINE

Or you. 

GEORGE

Hey, hey. 

ELAINE

Hey. 

JULIE

Sorry e're late. 

ELAINE

No problem. 

JULIE

Here's your big salad. 

ELAINE

Thank you, Julie. 

JULIE

Oh, you're very welcome. So, I guess I better get going. Gotta meet mother a t the Guggenheim. Sure you don't want to go? 

GEORGE

No, you go Guggenheim. I'm not much of a Guggenheim. 

JULIE

Sure, George. 

GEORGE

Ya, you go. 

JULIE

Okay, I'll see you later. Goodbye. 

JERRY

Bye bye 

GEORGE

Did you see what just happened? 

JERRY

Well, that all depends. . . 

GEORGE

Did you happen to notice that Julie handed the big salad to Elaine? 

JERRY

Yeah, so? 

GEORGE

Well, she didn't BUY the big salad. I bought the big salad. 

JERRY

Is that a fact? 

GEORGE

Yes it is. She just took credit for my salad. That's not right. 

JERRY

No it isn't. 

GEORGE

I mean I'm the one who bought it. 

JERRY

Yes you did. 

GEORGE

You think she should have said something? 

JERRY

She could have. 

GEORGE

Oh, I know. 

JERRY

Imagine, her taking credit for your big salad. 

GEORGE

You know you buy a big salad for somebody it would be nice if they knew it. 

JERRY

Obviously. 

KRAMER

Turn on the TV. 

JERRY

What? 

KRAMER

I'm puttin it on... 

TV

. . . the district attorney's office and the police department have not answered any questions as yet. To repeat in case you're just joining us. Former baseball start Steve Genderson, has been taken to Police headquarters for questioning the murder of Bobby Pinkus the owner of Royal Dry Cleaners at 2759 Amsterdam Avenue. According to Pinkus' wife, Gendeson had been involved in a dispute with the cleaner about a stain on a pair of gray Sans-A-Belt slacks. We also have a report that earlier in the day a groundskeeper at Vancourtland's Golf Course saw an irate Gendeson leaving the clubhouse in a huff. Whether there is a possible connection between the two is something we'll just have to wait. 

KRAMER

Jerry . . . 

JERRY

Well, it has nothing to do with you. 

KRAMER

Yeah, but maybe he was so mad from the penalty stroke that he murdered the dry cleaner. 

JERRY

Well, generally speaking you don't need any extra incentive to murder a dry cleaner. I wouldn't worry about that. 

ELAINE

I like Julie. She's very personable. 

GEORGE

Yeah, she's very lovely. 

ELAINE

That's great George. 

GEORGE

So did you enjoy your lunch? 

ELAINE

Yeah, A big salad. Very good. Actually it was too big. Ha ha ha Wht? 

GEORGE

oh, . . .because she handed you the bag. I could have handed you the bag. She happened to pick it up at the restaurant even though, . . . 

ELAINE

Even though what? 

GEORGE

. . . naw, it's just you thanked HER, and and oh, . . . what's the difference? 

ELAINE

What? What are you trying to say, George? 

GEORGE

It's just that I was the one who actually paid for the big salad. She just happened to hand it to you. But it's no big deal. 

ELAINE

You want the money for the big salad, George? 

GEORGE

No, no, 

ELAINE

What is the problem? 

GEORGE

There is no problem. . . just a small miscommunication. Whereby you thanked her instead of the person actually responsible for purchasing the big salad. 

JERRY

And Kramer thinks a penalty stroke may have driven him to it. 

MARGARET

Well, they haven't even arrested him yet. Come on, let's go out. 

JERRY

Ah, no , I don't think so. 

MARGARET

Why not? 

JERRY

We don't need a bunch of people staring at us. 

MARGARET

Who is staring? 

JERRY

Oh, they're staring. They know we're on a date. They're making fun. Come on. It's embarrassing. 

JERRY

Hello. No she's not here. Yes I will tell her. No I don't know what time she might be coming back. Look I gotta' go. Goodbye. . . . That, that's a long story. 

JERRY

Hello Newman. 

MARGARET

Hello Jerry, I was wondering if you knew where Kramer was. 

JERRY

No, no I don't. Why? 

MARGARET

You know, Genderson. This is something big. 

JERRY

I suppose. 

MARGARET

What did Kramer say? 

JERRY

I don't know. Nothing.? 

MARGARET

Come on Jerry. You know something TELL ME! TELL ME!, Oh, chocolates . . . Margaret? 

MARGARET

Hello. 

JERRY

You two know each other? 

NEWMAN

You might say that. 

MARGARET

We used to go out. 

NEWMAN

Well, tootle loo. And nice seeing you again Margaret, goodbye Jerry. Have fun. Hehe 

JERRY

. . . YOU went out with . . . Newman? 

MARGARET

Just a few times. 

JERRY

Why? 

MARGARET

I liked him. 

JERRY

You liked, Newman? 

MARGARET

Look I'm a little uncomfortable talking about this okay? 

JERRY

No, I'm sorry. I'm just a little curious. I mean why did you stop seeing him. 

MARGARET

He ended it. 

JERRY

. . . HE ended it? 

MARGARET

YES!! Yes! It was a couple of years ago. Why does it matter? 

JERRY

No, no of course not. 

KRAMER

Jerry, Jerry they found a tee. 

JERRY

What tee? 

KRAMER

A golf tee. In the dry cleaner. 

JERRY

Newman! She went out with Newman! 

ELAINE

It must be a mistake. 

JERRY

No. It isn't and the most distressing part of it is, not that she went out with him but that HE stopped seeing her. Do you understand? He, Newman; Newman stopped seeing her. Newman never stopped seeing anybody. Newman will see whoever is willing to see him. Not so much why she did see him as disturbing as that is. But why, did HE, Newman, stop seeing her? 

ELAINE

Perhaps there's more to him than meets the eye. 

JERRY

No, there's less. 

ELAINE

It's possible. 

JERRY

No it isn't. I've looked into his eyes. He's pure evil. 

ELAINE

He's an enigma, a mystery wrapped in a riddle. 

JERRY

Yeah, he's a mystery wrapped in a Twinkie. 

JERRY

No,, but thank you. 

JERRY

Oh, by the way, your stationery store guy called and he's got your pencil. 

ELAINE

Ugh! You are kidding me. 

JERRY

No, he left the store early, made a special trip to the distributor and got it. 

ELAINE

I bought mine yesterday on 14th Street. 

JERRY

Well, what did you do that for? You ordered it. 

ELAINE

To please Mr. Pitt. 

JERRY

Well, you better go down there and tell this guy. He's very excited. 

ELAINE

Uh, great! 

JERRY

Hi Julie. 

JERRY

Hi. 

ELAINE

Hi Julie. 

JERRY

Hi, how are you, Elaine? I'm meeting George here. 

ELAINE

Oh, well then I better get going otherwise George will make me buy him lunch to make up for that big salad he bought me yesterday. 

JERRY

How do you know THAT? 

NEWMAN

Who is it. 

JERRY

It's Jerry. 

NEWMAN

You've come at a bad time now. Could you come back later? 

JERRY

Come on Newman. OPEN THE DOOR! 

NEWMAN

Hellooo Jerry. What a rare treat. What brings you down to the east wing? 

JERRY

Okay, pudgy, lets stop playing games. What happened with margaret? 

NEWMAN

There's no need to get excited. Can't we discuss this like gentlemen? 

JERRY

No, we can't. My skin is crawling just being inside your little rat's nest. Now, what happened? 

NEWMAN

Do you really want to know what happened? I'll tell you what Happened. She wasn't my type. 

JERRY

Noit your type? 

NEWMAN

Not really. 

JERRY

Well, how come? 

NEWMAN

Ah, she just didn't do it for me. 

JERRY

What, what is wrong with her? 

NEWMAN

Well, h ha ha- if you're happy with her, that's all that matters. 

JERRY

You don't think she's attractive? 

NEWMAN

No. I need a really pretty face. But, Hey, that's me. 

JERRY

Okay, Newman, thanks a lot. 

NEWMAN

Care for some lemonade? 

JERRY

No, thank you. 

NEWMAN

Drop bye anytime, jerry. Hah, ha ha 

KRAMER

Listen to this, 'If a player cleans his ball during the play of a hole accept on the putting green he shall incur a penalty of one stroke. ' That's a rule, Jerry. 

JERRY

But it's just a friendly game. Why do you have to be such a stickler? 

KRAMER

Because that's the way I weas raised. You know when I was growing up I had to be in bed every night by nine o'clock. And if I wasn't, well I don't have to tell you what happened. 

JERRY

What are you so worried about this for? 

KRAMER

You know he talked about Pinkus on the course? 

JERRY

He did? 

KRAMER

Oh yeah, he said he brought a pair of pants into Pinkus' and they came back stained with some kind of dry cleaning fluid. And Pinkus denied responsibility. You see he was very upset with Pinkus. 

JERRY

So it had nothing to do with you. 

KRAMER

Yeah, but maybe I pushed him over the edge. 

JERRY

No, I don't think so. 

KRAMER

Poor Pinkus, poor little Pinkus. 

JERRY

Hey, let me ask you a question. You met margaret. Doo you think Margaret's good looking? Um, she's a natural beauty. Oh, no makeup. I like that. 

JERRY

Yeah, and the curls. You like the curls? 

KRAMER

Oh, I love curls. 

JERRY

Yeah,, me too. 

KRAMER

All right, I'll see you later. 

JERRY

Where you going? 

KRAMER

Genderson's. 

JERRY

You're going to see Genderson? 

KRAMER

It's weighing on my conscience. 

GEORGE

You know, I think I could have played with dolls if their were dolls in the house. It seems like fun to me. It doesn't seem like a gender thing. I think I would like to play with dolls. What's so terrible? 

JULIE

Ha. So, George, I was talking to Elaine before. 

GEORGE

A ha! We're just friends. 

JULIE

Yes, well anyway, she said something that was kind of intriguing. 

GEORGE

Oh, share. 

JULIE

Well, when I came over to the table she mentioned something about how she better hurry up and leave or you'd make her buy lunch to make up for the one you bought yesterday. 

GEORGE

Ha, ha ha uh, I'm not following that. 

JULIE

Well, my question is, How could Elaine be under the impression that you bought the big salad, when I was the one who handed it to her? 

GEORGE

Well, she probably just assumed. 

JULIE

Um, did she? 

GEORGE

. . .uh, . . . wait a second. Are you suggesting that I went out of my way to tell Elaine that even though you handed her the big salad, that it came from me? 

JULIE

That's what I'm suggesting. 

GEORGE

. . . WELL IT WAS A BIG SALAD. AND WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IS, HOW DOES A PERSON WHO HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE BIG SALAD CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT SALAD AND ACCEPT THE THANK YOU UNDER FALSE PRETENSES - AH - AH? 

JULIE

George, all I did was hand someone a bag. 

ELAINE

It's just that my boss is very demanding and he needed the pencil right away. 

STATIONER

Well,, why did you tell me to order it if you knew you were going to get one someplace else? 

ELAINE

No, no no I didn't know. I, I'm sorry. 

STATIONER

I went all the way down to the warehouse. It took me three hours. I had a big fight with the foreman. 

ELAINE

Really? A fight with the foreman? 

STATIONER

Yes. 

ELAINE

Well, again, I'm just awfully sorry. 

STATIONER

Yeah? Well, then how about going out with me tonight? 

ELAINE

Okay. 

MARGARET

I mean they found a tee and he played golf that day. Nobody walks into a dry cleaner's with a tee. The circumstantial evidence is overwhelming. 

JERRY

You had how many dates with him? Three? 

MARGARET

Around three. I don't know. 

JERRY

And . . 

MARGARET

I told you. He stopped calling me. I moved on. I'm not hung up on him. What are you looking at? 

JERRY

What? I'm not looking. Nothing. 

JERRY

Why are you looking at my face? 

JERRY

Where am I going to look? 

MARGARET

Kiss me. 

JERRY

. . . I can't. 

JERRY

Newman! 

JERRY

All I could think of was when I was looking at her face was; Newman found this unacceptable. 

ELAINE

Well, ,I'm going out with the stationery store guy. 

JERRY

You're going out with the stationery store guy? 

ELAINE

I felt so guilty about the pencil I couldn't say no. 

ELAINE

Well, well, well, I'm not treating you to lunch ANYMORE! You had to tell Julie that I made a special point of telling you that I bought you the big salad. Didn't ya'. 

ELAINE

Uh, uh. 

GEORGE

You know, if it was a regular salad I wouldn't have said anything. But you had to have the BIG SALAD. 

JERRY

Hello, what? You're kidding. I'm turning it on. Oh, my god. Get out of here. (hangs up) Hey listen to this. They issued a warrant for Genderson's arrest. He escaped and the police spotted him on the New Jersey Turnpike. 

TV

As you can see white Bronco. The police have cleared the highway traffic in front of him but they are keeping their distance and don't want the situation to escalate. And we have gotten an identification on the driver of the vehicle. His name is; Kramer, one of Genderson's golfing buddies. 

POLICE

9-1-1 What are you reporting 

KRAMER

Yeah, this is Kramer. I got Genderson in the car. He wants to see his fish. I'm taking him to see his fish. So tell the police to back off. 

POLICE

Okay, sir, and what's your name? 

KRAMER

My name is Kramer. You know who I am dammit! 

KRAMER

I thought we would blend in. 

KRAMER

we would have had all that bridge traffic. 

ELAINE

She was hitting on you? My friend Noreen? 

JERRY

Your friend, Noreen. 

ELAINE

Are you sure you're not just flattering yourself? 

JERRY

If I was flattering myself, I think I'd come up with someone a little less annoying than Noreen. 

ELAINE

I cannot believe that she was hitting on you. 

JERRY

If you don't believe me, ask her. 

ELAINE

I will. Besides, she's got a boyfriend, Jerry, you know him. Dan. Remember, we went to that party at his house? 

JERRY

Oh, right. The guy who talks with a really high voice. 

ELAINE

Yeah. 

KRAMER

Jerry, did you get my Fortune magazine in your mail? 

JERRY

Check the pile. 

KRAMER

(leafing through Jerry's mail) Oh, who sent you a card? 

JERRY

I don't know. 

KRAMER

Open it, it's from Hallmark. 

JERRY

Oh. 

ELAINE

Hello, darling. 

JERRY

Isn't that cute, a 'thank you' card from Kristin. 

KRAMER

Let me see. 

ELAINE

Who's Kristin? 

JERRY

She works for PBS, I met her when I agreed to do that pledge drive. 

KRAMER

Did you ask her about me? 

JERRY

Yeah, in fact she said that you could be one of those people that sits in the back and answers the phone. 

KRAMER

Giddy-up! Alright! So now, how does that work? Now, what, I get a percentage of every pledge I bring in, right? 

JERRY

No, it's not aluminum siding, it's volunteer work. All the money goes to the station. 

KRAMER

Okay, yeah, alright, that sounds good, but I still get a tote bag though, right? 

JERRY

Yeah, and one of those foam beer can holders. 

ELAINE

(dialing the phone) You know what I'm doing? I'm calling Noreen. 

JERRY

Oh, go ahead. 

ELAINE

You sure you don't mind? 

JERRY

Like she's really going to admit she was flirting with me. 

VOICE

Hello? 

ELAINE

Hi, it's Elaine. Listen, I was just talking to Jerry. 

VOICE

Jerry? 

ELAINE

Jerry Seinfeld. 

VOICE

Oh, I like Jerry a lot. 

ELAINE

You mean like like? 

VOICE

What are you talking about? 

ELAINE

Noreen, were you hitting on him? 

VOICE

Noreen's not here, this is Dan. 

ELAINE

Ooh. 

DAN

You say that Noreen was hitting on Jerry Seinfeld? 

ELAINE

Uh oh. 

JERRY

So was I right? She likes me, right? 

ELAINE

Oh, I'm sorry Mr. Pitt. Hello? 

VOICE

Elaine? What is going on? Why did you tell Dan I was hitting on Jerry Seinfeld? 

ELAINE

Is this Noreen? 

VOICE

(Noreen) What would ever possess you to make up a story like that. 

ELAINE

Well, listen, Jerry mentioned it, and, I don't know-- 

ELAINE

Noreen, are you crying? 

DAN

No, this is Dan! 

ELAINE

Oh, hi Dan. 

PITT

Elaine? Work? 

ELAINE

Tell Noreen I'll just call her back later. 

PITT

Who was crying? 

ELAINE

No one. I'm sorry Mr. Pitt, that won't happen again. 

PITT

(unwrapping a candy bar, placing it on a plate and cutting it with knife and fork) I'm sure it won't, but someone was crying and I want to know who it was. 

ELAINE

Well, it's a long story, okay? But my stupid friend Jerry told my other friend Noreen that she was-- (noticing Mr. Pitt eating the candy bar with knife and fork and becoming distracted) You know, hitting on him and so I called her to see what was, uh, going on and I accidentally got her boyfriend, who is this, you know-- 

JERRY

I'm Jerry Seinfeld, I tell jokes for a living, but there's no joking about the financial crisis at PBS. Show us you care. Call in your pledge now. 

KRISTIN

Jerry, I am so grateful that you're doing this. 

JERRY

Oh, I know you are. 

KRISTIN

You got the card I sent? 

JERRY

I did. 

KRISTIN

So where is it? 

JERRY

What? 

KRISTIN

The card. Is this it in the trash? 

JERRY

No? 

KRISTIN

This is my card, you threw it away. 

JERRY

Well-- 

KRISTIN

I put a lot of thought into this card. 

JERRY

You signed your name and you addressed the envelope, it's not like you painted the picture and wrote the poem. 

KRISTIN

Fine. I gotta get back to the office. 

JERRY

Why, because I threw the card out? How long was I supposed to save it? 

KRISTIN

You have no sentimentality. 

JERRY

I have sentimentality, really, I'm sentimental. Here, look. Here's some cards I've saved, these are birthday cards from my grandmother, see, I'm not a bad guy. 

KRISTIN

Oh, so you save her cards but not mine! Oh great! 

JERRY

(as Kristin is storming out) Well, but, you see, I saved something! See? I can save. I'll see you at the pledge drive, ok? 

KRAMER

New cards, huh? 

JERRY

No, they're old cards from my grandmother. 

KRAMER

Oh. Well, I'll tell you, a nice greeting card can really lift a person's spirits. 

JERRY

Yeah. 

KRAMER

(opening a card) Oh, a check. 

JERRY

Yeah, she puts ten dollars in every card for my birthday, that's why I save them. 

KRAMER

There's a check in all these? Why don't you cash them? 

JERRY

I don't know, it's ten dollars. 

KRAMER

But you got a whole pile here. 1987? 

JERRY

Oh so what. 

KRAMER

Jerry, your grandmother gave you this gift. She wants you to spend the money, to have the fun that she can't have. Oh, this is tantamount to a slap in the face. 

JERRY

Oh, get out of here. 

KRAMER

Jerry, a gift not enjoyed is like a flower that doesn't blossom. 

JERRY

Alright, alright, I'll cash the checks. 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

JERRY

It was a 'thank you' card from Kristin because I'm doing the PBS drive. I mean, how long am I supposed to keep it? 

GEORGE

The rule is a minimum of two days. 

JERRY

You making that up or do you know what you're talking about? 

GEORGE

I'm making it up. 

JERRY

I mean really, what's the point of saving it? I could see if I had a mantel. 

GEORGE

Oh, well, a mantel's a whole different story. 

JERRY

Absolutely. 

GEORGE

If my parents had a mantel, I might be a completely different person. 

JERRY

So anyway, she's kind of upset about it so I need you to do me a favor. 

GEORGE

Let's have it. 

JERRY

Well, I'm doing the PBS show, so during the show they're gonna be running the Ken Burns baseball thing. So I thought if I could get a baseball player to come on the show with me... 

GEORGE

You want me to ask one of the Yankees. 

JERRY

Could you? 

GEORGE

Alright. I'll run it by a few people. 

JERRY

Alright, Do your thing, where you lie to everyone. 

ELAINE

(entering and sitting down) I should never have made that phone call. 

JERRY

Hey, did you ever get to talk to Noreen? 

ELAINE

Yes, she's very upset. 

JERRY

So was I right about the flirting? Was it true? 

ELAINE

I don't know, I never asked. She was yelling-- 

GEORGE

Who was flirting with you? 

JERRY

Remember when we were in the bookstore, that woman came up to us? 

GEORGE

She wasn't flirting with you. 

JERRY

Oh, sure she was; Asked me where the 'humor' section was? Humor? Come on. 

ELAINE

Jerry, her brother just had a book of political cartoons published. 

JERRY

Alright, so maybe she wasn't flirting with me. So what? 

ELAINE

So, yeah, that's funny. Hey, you wanna hear something weird? Mr. Pitt eats his Snickers bars with a knife and fork. 

GEORGE

Really? 

ELAINE

Yeah. 

JERRY

Why does he do that? 

GEORGE

He probably doesn't want to get chocolate on his fingers. That's the way these society types eat their candy bars. 

JERRY

Oh, you know. 

GEORGE

What, you think I eat all my meals with you? (To waitress) Excuse me, sweetheart? I think you may have overcharged us. What is this? 

WAITRESS

That's the extra toast. Get it? 

GEORGE

Got it. (the waitress walks away) Did you just see what happened here? 

ELAINE

What? 

GEORGE

Did you see the way she pointed at the check? She gave me the finger. 

JERRY

That's how waitress types express derision. They don't want to get their mouths dirty. 

GEORGE

So, what do you think? 

MORGAN

A PBS fundraiser? I'm not gonna waste any of the players' time with that, besides the team already does so much promotion for channel eleven. 

GEORGE

Channel eleven? Forgive me for trying to class up this place, for trying to have the Yankees reach another strata of society that might not watch channel eleven. 

MORGAN

Uh, what the hell are you doing? 

GEORGE

I am eating my dessert. How do you eat it, with your hands? 

MORGAN

You know, maybe George has something here about PBS. 

JERRY

Okay, sixty bucks from Nana. 

KRAMER

Huh? Yeah. 

NANA

Hello? 

VOICE

Hello, this is Chemical Bank. Just wanted you to know that your checking account is overdrawn. 

NANA

Chemical Bank? I haven't used that account in months. 

VOICE

Well, someone's been cashing the checks and you're overdrawn. 

NANA

Oh dear. I'll be down there first thing in the morning. 

VOICE

(unheard by Nana as she hangs up the phone) Wait, we can do this over the phone. 

JERRY

You got Danny Tartabull?! 

GEORGE

You wanted a Yankee, I got you a Yankee. 

JERRY

Boy, you really came through. Kristin's gonna be thrilled. 

GEORGE

Hey, the Bull owes me one, I helped him with his swing. 

KRAMER

So you're bringing Danny Tartabull to the fundraiser tonight. 

GEORGE

Absolutely. Pending approval of the script. 

JERRY

Excuse me? 

GEORGE

Jerry, I'm Yankee management. 

KRAMER

Yeah, I'd like to see the script too. 

JERRY

You're just answering phones! 

KRAMER

It would put me at ease. 

GEORGE

Hey, when you order from the waitress, get her to point to the menu. I want to see what finger she uses. 

JERRY

Uh, say, I wanted a side order of fruit but I didn't see it on the men 

WAITRESS

Oh, you're getting it (pointing to menu with index finger), it comes with your breakfast special. 

JERRY

Right you are. 

GEORGE

I didn't get the special, but I'd also like the fresh fruit too. 

WAITRESS

(scratching cheek with middle finger) I'll check. 

GEORGE

(after waitress walks away) I don't believe it, she did it again! 

JERRY

Oh, she had an itch. 

GEORGE

She had an itch. She could have used any one of those fingers. That finger was meant for me. 

JERRY

By the way, lunch is on me. I just cashed my Nana's birthday checks. 

TOUGH

Looking for something, lady? 

NANA

Isn't the Chemical Bank on this block? 

TOUGH

The bank? It burned. It's gone! 

NANA

Oh dear. 

JERRY

(answering) Hello? 

LEO

Jerry? Hello. 

JERRY

Uncle Leo! 

LEO

Listen, I don't want to alarm you, but your nana is missing. 

JERRY

Nana's missing? 

LEO

I came to pick her up for a doctor's appointment, she wasn't here. I called the doctor, nobody knows where she is. She hasn't left the apartment in twenty-five years! 

JERRY

I've been thinking about her, I just cashed some of her checks. 

KRAMER

Yeah, that's right. You did. 

LEO

What kind of checks? 

JERRY

I think Chemical Bank. 

KRAMER

Oh, they were Chemical. 

LEO

Chemical?! She hasn't used that account since her branch closed. What are you doing cashing her checks anyway? 

JERRY

Well, Kramer thought it would make her happy. (To Kramer) I never should have cashed those checks! 

KRAMER

Hey, I didn't twist your arm. 

LEO

Your grandmother's on a very fixed income. What, are you broke? 

JERRY

Just call me if you hear anything. (hangs up and faces Kramer) Well? I cashed the checks, the checks bounced and now my Nana's missing! 

KRAMER

Well, don't look at me. 

JERRY

It's your fault! 

KRAMER

My fault? Your Nana is missing because she's been passing those bum checks all over town and she finally pissed off the wrong people. 

NOREEN

So anyway, it's caused a lot of problems. Dan thinks I'm interested in Jerry, he won't let up. 

ELAINE

I'm really sorry, but you can see why I'd make a mistake like that. 

NOREEN

No, why? 

ELAINE

Well, you know, because he's a high talker. 

NOREEN

He does raise his voice occasionally, but that's normal. 

ELAINE

No. No, no, no, not a loud talker, a high talker. 

NOREEN

Really? 

ELAINE

You don't think his voice sounds a lot like yours? 

NOREEN

I never noticed that. 

ELAINE

Well, it's no big deal, you know, it's just that he can sound like a woman, you know? 

NOREEN

Great. I'm going out with a man who sounds like a woman. 

ELAINE

Well, he looks like a man. 

NOREEN

Yeah. 

ELAINE

He's bald. I know that's a guy thing. 

NOREEN

I guess. 

ELAINE

I know he belches a lot. 

NOREEN

Well, that's something. So, Jerry thought I was flirting with him. 

ELAINE

Yeah. 

NOREEN

(cutting into a cookie with a knife and fork) Hm. He's kind of a baritone, isn't he? 

ELAINE

What are you doing? 

NOREEN

I'm eating this cookie. 

ELAINE

No, no, no, but why are you using a knife and a fork? Did you just 

NOREEN

No, I've seen people do it. I like it. 

TARTABULL

This isn't gonna take long, is it? 

GEORGE

Oh no, in and out, I made sure of that. And you'll be happy to know I perused the script and it's met with my approval. 

TARTABULL

I'm sure it's fine. 

GEORGE

(swerving) Hey! Watch it! Did you see that guy? He just gave me the finger! 

TARTABULL

You sure? 

GEORGE

Oh yeah! Middle finger, straight up, at me! At us! 

TARTABULL

What are you doing? 

GEORGE

I'm following him. 

ELAINE

And now I think she might really be interested in you. And Dan is 

JERRY

Would you? 

KRAMER

Any word from Nana? 

JERRY

No. 

ELAINE

Nana? 

JERRY

Yeah, my grandma's missing. 

ELAINE

Missing? 

JERRY

Yeah. I think it might have something to do with those checks. 

ELAINE

Um, what does Nana sound like? 

JERRY

Like a grandmother, why? 

ELAINE

Well... 

JERRY

Oh, you hung up on my Nana?! 

ELAINE

I don't know, maybe. 

JERRY

You told Nana to drop dead?! 

ELAINE

It's possible. 

JERRY

Yes, it is! 

KRAMER

Alright, alright. Look, Jerry, we gotta get down to PBS, PDQ. 

JERRY

Alright. 

GEORGE

No one gives us the finger! We're Yankees! 

TARTABULL

Want this last donut? 

GEORGE

No, you can have it. 

KRAMER

Jerry, where are all the tote bags? 

JERRY

I don't know. 

KRAMER

Well, I'm not leaving the premises without tote bags. I was promised tote bags and tote bags I shall have. 

KRISTIN

Jerry, this man wants to see you. 

JERRY

Leo? 

LEO

Hello. 

JERRY

Uncle Leo! What are you doing here? 

LEO

I wanted to tell you that your grandmother is fine. 

JERRY

Oh. 

LEO

She's had quite a day but she's gonna watch you tonight on the TV. 

KRISTIN

Jerry, I'm dying to meet Danny Tartabull. Where is he? 

JERRY

He'll be here any second. 

KRISTIN

You know you guys are both on in five minutes. 

JERRY

Yeah, yeah. 

KRISTIN

(leaving) Okay. 

LEO

Why didn't you tell me you were a little short? Here. If anybody asks you where you got it, you don't know. 

JERRY

No, that's ok, I really don't need any money. 

LEO

What are you talking about? 

JERRY

Please- 

LEO

I want- 

JERRY

It's not necessary. 

LEO

Jerry, would you please take it. 

JERRY

I can't, I can't take it. 

LEO

I want you to have it! 

JERRY

Uncle Leo, I don't want to have it! 

LEO

Jerry, take the money! 

JERRY

I don't want it!! 

VOICE

Jerry, open up. We need to talk. 

KRAMER

Who's that? 

JERRY

You know what? It sounds like the friend of Elaine's that was hitting on me in the book store. 

KRAMER

Jerry, I'll take care of it. 

DAN

Is Jerry in there? 

KRAMER

Well, he can't be disturbed now. 

DAN

Well this situation is driving me crazy. He's all I think about. I can't get him out of my mind. 

KRAMER

I'm sorry. I mean, I know what it's like to be in love. Ties you up in knots. And Jerry is a very sexy man. 

DAN

What? 

KRAMER

Look, I'm not judging you. In fact, we here at PBS, we have many programs celebrating your lifestyle. Armistead Maupin's Tales of the City, Gender Bending and Swinging in San Francisco. Before Stonewall about those dark ages when you couldn't come out of the closet, lest you be persecuted because of your, you know. 

DAN

No, I don't. 

KRISTIN

(running up) Are you Danny Tartabull? 

DAN

No, I'm not. 

GEORGE

I'll take care of this, Danny. 

GEORGE

Excuse me. 

MAN

What's the problem? 

GEORGE

I believe you cut me off, and then made an obscene gesture. 

MAN

I did? Where? 

GEORGE

Outside of Manhattan, about an hour ago. 

MAN

Wow! Is that Danny Tartabull? 

GEORGE

That's right, of the New York Yankees. 

MAN

I'd like to shake his hand but I can't. 

JERRY

I'm Jerry Seinfeld, I tell jokes for a living, but there's no joking about the financial crisis here at PBS. Our lines are open, so please call the number you see on your screen. 

JERRY

This is the only time this year we'll be asking for donations. You've been enjoying Ken Burns' Baseball- 

KRAMER

(answering) PBS pledge drive. 

NANA

Hello, I'd like to speak with Jerry. 

KRAMER

Oh, you again. Buddy, look, forget about Jerry. It's not gonna happen. 

NANA

This is his grandmother. 

KRAMER

Oh, uh, Nana. Hello. 

NANA

Tell Jerry I'm sorry, I'm going to have to write him some new checks. 

KRAMER

As long as you've got your checkbook out, how about forking a little over to PBS? You watch the station, don't you? You don't want to be a freeloader. 

JERRY

-programs like Ken Burns' Baseball. And if Danny Tartabull were here, I'm sure he'd say, 'That's correct, Jerry.' 

KRAMER

Jerry? I have an announcement. Your grandmother is on the line. 

JERRY

My Nana? 

KRAMER

And as we speak, she's generously writing PBS a check for fifteen hundred dollars! 

LEO

She can't do that, she's on a very fixed income! Stop the show!! 

JERRY

I got another card from Kristin. Not quite as chipper as the first one. 

ELAINE

Wow. Isn't this little bunny giving you the- 

JERRY

Yes, he is. 

ELAINE

You should show this to Georgie. 

JERRY

Yeah. 

WAITRESS

(at the next table) Here's your knife and fork. 

JERRY

Look, she's cutting up an Almond Joy. 

ELAINE

I just don't get it. 

JERRY

You know, I saw someone on the street eating M&Ms with a spoon. 

ELAINE

What is wrong with everybody? 

JERRY

(surveying the restaurant) Look, they're doing it. They're all doing it! 

ELAINE

(standing up) What is wrong with all you people?! Have you all gone mad?!! 

JERRY

(feeling face) Good shave today... 

ELAINE

(sarcastic) Don't worry, Jerry, I can manage these bags; really I'm fine. 

JERRY

I'm thinkin' of lettin' my sideburns grow in a little... 

ELAINE

Can we rest here a second. 

JERRY

(pause) Yeah, I guess. 

JERRY

...So how's Noreen? 

ELAINE

Mmm! She's got a new boyfriend: Paul. 

JERRY

Already? That was fast... I assume he's not a High Talker... 

ELAINE

No, but... he has... The Worst Habit. Whenever he answers the phone, he won't put Noreen right on. Ya have'ta go through, like, ten minutes of chit-chat. 

JERRY

A Long Talker. 

ELAINE

Yeah! And he is so boring! But now, whenever he answers the phone: I just hang up. 

JERRY

(pause) All right; let's move it out. 

JERRY

Hey, isn't that George's father? 

ELAINE

Oh, yeah, it is! Shall we say hello? 

JERRY

I've never seen him in Manhattan before; it's weird. So out of context. 

ELAINE

That man he's with: is he wearing a cape? 

JERRY

I believe he is wearing a cape. 

ELAINE

Why is Mr. Costanza with a man in a cape? 

JERRY

Well, it is good cape weather. Cool. Breezy. 

ELAINE

Yeah, why a cape? Who wears a cape? Where do you even get a cape? 

JERRY

You're right; it is strange. In fact, let's cross to the other side of the street. Cover me. 

JERRY

Just, uh, plop it on the counter there. 

JERRY

Oh! I got a message. (presses button on answer machine) 

GEORGE

(on tape, lifeless) Hey, it's George. I got nothin' to say... (beep) 

ELAINE

That sounds urgent... 

JERRY

Let me call him back... Hello? Who is this? Donna Chang? Oh, I'm sorry, I must o' dialed the wrong number. 

ELAINE

Donna Chang? 

JERRY

(is redialing) I should've talked to her; I love Chinese women. 

ELAINE

Isn't that a little racist? 

JERRY

If I like their race, how can that be racist?... Hellooo??... Oh, is this Donna Chang again?!... Yyy-yes, I am calling George... Oh, the lines are crossed! You're getting his calls. Well, what do you know?! 

JERRY

So listen... 

KRAMER

Hi. I'm goin' through this stuff like water... (to Jerry) Who you talkin' to? (Jerry waves him away and moves towards the bedroom, still on the phone) 

ELAINE

He's on with a Chinese woman. 

KRAMER

Oooo, ooooo. You know, I dig Asian women. 

ELAINE

You got a comfort problem there? 

KRAMER

No, I think these Jockeys shrunk. 

ELAINE

I thought you wore silk underwear. 

KRAMER

No, no, n--Well, you know, I wore 'em for about a month but I couldn't stick with it. No, I need the secure packaging of Jockeys. (he's serious. Then he makes a hand gesture of grabbing up) My boys need a house! 

ELAINE

(not charmed) That's nice. Listen, Kramer, you know, if you ever want to have kids you shouldn't wear briefs. Boxers are much better for your sperm count. 

KRAMER

Sperm count? Well how many ssssperm should I have? 

ELAINE

A lot! 

JERRY

I got a date! 

ELAINE

With the Chinese woman?! 

JERRY

She knew who I was! She saw me in a club one time! My first date ever with the Pacific Rim. I'm very excited. 

KRAMER

Jerry. Did ya ever have your sperm count checked? 

JERRY

No, why should I? I wear boxers. 

KRAMER

You ever get a woman pregnant? 

JERRY

I'm sorry, Kramer. Those records are permanently sealed... 

KRAMER

What would you say if I told you I never impregnated a woman? 

JERRY

Really? You never slipped one past the goalie in all these years??... Boy, I'm surprised. You've slept with a lot of women! 

KRAMER

A LOT of 'em! (wild gesture, freaked out) Do you think maybe I'm... Depleted??!! 

JERRY

Well, I'm sure you're not... Totally Depleted. 

KRAMER

Yeah but what if I am? I'm the last... male Kramer! We're facing extinction! 

JERRY

So go to a fertility clinic. Have your sperm count checked. 

KRAMER

Yeah, but then I'd have to... (glances at Elaine) well, you know... into a cup in the middle of the day?? 

ELAINE

What, does that conflict with your regular schedule? 

ELAINE

(going to the phone) All right. I'm gonna try Noreen again. 

JERRY

I am very excited about this date! We're goin' to Hunan Balcony! 

ELAINE

She's Chinese so you suggest Chinese food? 

JERRY

She suggested it! 

ELAINE

I thought Chinese don't eat Chinese... 

JERRY

She's very assimilated. 

JERRY

Paul again? 

ELAINE

(matter of fact) You can't get one ring past him. 

GEORGE

Hey, hey, hey! You don't call me back?! 

JERRY

I tried! Your line's crossed with a Chinese woman! 

GEORGE

...Huh? 

ELAINE

Hey, George, we saw your father on the street before. 

GEORGE

Hmm, what's he doin' in the city today? 

GEORGE

You didn't ask him? 

GEORGE

(suspicious) You didn't say hello? 

ELAINE

Well, he was with someone. A man... In a cape. 

GEORGE

Why was he wearing a cape? 

GEORGE

Was my father wearing a cape? 

JERRY

No. Jacket and tie: no cape. 

GEORGE

Huh... Cape... (turns, distracted, heads slowly towards door) What was a man with a cape doin' with my father?... What was my father doing with a man in a cape?... (opens door) Why a cape? Hmm! (exits) 

DOCTOR

The results of your sperm test are in. 

KRAMER

Oh? 

DOCTOR

Ummm... Are you planning to start a family? 

KRAMER

Yes! I would like to very much!... Well, I'm low, aren't I? I ca--I can feel it!... 

DOCTOR

Yes, I'm afraid you're a little low. 

KRAMER

Ohhh, maaan!! It's over! The Kramer name is finished! I'm never goin' to procreate-- 

DOCTOR

Ah--that's not necessarily true. 

KRAMER

What 

DOCTOR

There are measures you can take to improve your fertility. 

KRAMER

All right, all right. What. What. You tell me; I'll do anything. Come on, Doc, tell me. 

DOCTOR

First thing: you should wear boxer shorts. 

KRAMER

All the time? 

DOCTOR

All the time. Ya have to get off Jockeys right away. 

KRAMER

Yeah, but I've always worn Jockeys. 

ELAINE

Hi Paul! It's Elaine calling! Yeah, I'm calling from a car phone so I don't really have time to talk. Is, is, uh, Noreen there?!... Oh. She's not?! (hurries to put phone down) Okay, great. Well you can just tell her I called, then, an'-- Well, yes. It has been unseasonably cool lately... Oh, okay, well, look I'm pulling up to the building now. So, I'm gonna... (a little later, Elaine is sitting and looking very bored) Yeah, I took 20% too... Um. Look it uh... (turns hair dryer on and off) Paul. The... car seems to be running out of gas so... I'm gonna... have to get off the phone. (hangs up) 

HOSTESS

Please let me know when the rest of your party has arrived, sir. 

JERRY

Yes, I will. 

GUY

(indicating a cigarette) Do you mind? 

JERRY

No, go ahead, I second-hand smoke two packs a day. 

DONNA

Jerry. 

JERRY

(pause. Stops tapping his leg) 'scuse me? 

DONNA

Hi. Sorry I'm late. 

JERRY

Who are you? 

DONNA

I'm Donna Chang... 

JERRY

(stands, puzzled, it's not sinking in) W-what do you mean? 

DONNA

I mean: I'm Donna Chang. 

JERRY

(pause) You're Donna Chang? 

DONNA

Did you think I was Chinese?... 

JERRY

Oh. No. What, you mean because of the 'Chang'? 

DONNA

Actually, the family name wasn't originally Chang. 

JERRY

I didn't think so. 

DONNA

Used to be 'Changstein.' 

ELAINE

She's not Chinese? 

JERRY

No. Not Chinese. Not even Asian. 

ELAINE

So. What is she? 

JERRY

Well, she's... like you. 

ELAINE

(pause, annoyed) Oh, how disappointed you must have been. (walks to couch, with her cereal) 

JERRY

Well, it's false advertising, see? And the thing is, I think she likes people thinkin' she's Chinese. She suggests Chinese food. She always introduces herself as 'Donna Chang'... 

ELAINE

So then why are you seeing her again... 

JERRY

Well, she is a woman. 

ELAINE

Listen, I spoke to Paul an' Noreen. They might be breakin' up. 

JERRY

Really? (sits on couch) 

ELAINE

Well, maybe. 

JERRY

Hey, wouldn't it be funny if Paul an' Noreen broke up because o' you kept hangin' up on him? 

ELAINE

(pause) What do you mean? 

JERRY

Well, you know if Paul thought it was some guy... hangin' up because he was having an affair with Noreen? 

KRAMER

Here, take my Jockey shorts. 

ELAINE

Whoa! Whoa! 

JERRY

Here, what is that?!! 

KRAMER

Look, you gotta help me. I have to get off Jockey shorts. 

JERRY

Wha--you have a low sperm count? 

KRAMER

Very low! Come on, Jerry. Take 'em. 

JERRY

Nnnoo--I don't want 'em. (starts backing away as Kramer follows him around the room carrying the underwear) 

KRAMER

Jerry, look! You gotta help me! I can't have 'em near me! If I have one pair in my house, I'm gonna wear them! 

JERRY

Look! I don't want 'em! 

KRAMER

All it takes is one pair! Now, come on! J-- 

JERRY

I'm not gonna be able to sleep if those are in the house! 

KRAMER

Boxers! How do you wear these things!! Look at that--they're baggin' up, they're rising in! An' there's nothing holding me in place! I'm flippin'! I'm floppin'! 

KRAMER

What am I gonna do!? Jerry! I'm goin' CRAZY in these things! (leaves) 

JERRY

(re the underwear pile) Well, I'm gonna have to move now. 

FRANK

Ya know what I like about Manhattan? There's no mosquitoes. 

GEORGE

Plenty of mosquitoes. 

FRANK

Queens is full of mosquitoes. 

GEORGE

So, Dad... 

FRANK

Gnats, too. If I'm not mistaken. 

GEORGE

(pause) Dad! I heard you were in the city the other day! 

FRANK

(angry) Your mother has to tell you every move I make?! 

GEORGE

Jerry and Elaine saw you. 

FRANK

They didn't say hello? 

GEORGE

Well, they were in a rush. 

FRANK

They couldn't just say hello?!... Oh, to hell with them. 

GEORGE

They, uh... said you were with some guy who was wearing a cape?... 

FRANK

Elaine, I can see, not sayin' hello. She's very--what's the word--uh, supercilious. 

GEORGE

So Dad,-- 

FRANK

(shouting and clapping hands in anger) How could Jerry not say Hello?!! 

JERRY

Did they uncross the lines yet? 

DONNA

No, they can't find the problem. It's really getting ridicurous. 

JERRY

(long pause -- did he hear 'ridicurous' -- should he say something -- can't decide if he should. Finally...) Did you say, 'ridicurous'? 

DONNA

Ridiculous. 

JERRY

(pause) I thought you said... 'ridicurous.' (Donna looks puzzled) 

GEORGE

Hey-- (spots Donna) 

JERRY

Oh, what are you doing here? 

GEORGE

Oh, I wanted to talk to you--I'm sorry, I--didn't know you... (re Donna) had company. (Jerry indicates he should stay) Hiya, I'm George. 

DONNA

Oh! Hi! (they shake hands) I'm Donna Chang. (George to himself registers that as weird. He and Jerry exchange sideways glances) I just spoke to your mother before. 

GEORGE

You spoke to my mother? 

DONNA

She was trying to call you, but-- 

JERRY

The rines are crossed? 

GEORGE

Did you say, 'The rines are crossed?' 

JERRY

Did I? 

DONNA

(pause) George, she's so sweet. We talked for an hour! 

GEORGE

(smile) Yeah. 

DONNA

Anyway, I'm really sorry. 

GEORGE

Sorry? Why sorry? What you got to be sorry about? 

DONNA

Well, she told me she and your father are getting divorced. 

ELAINE

Ay, divorced. That's really too bad... 

JERRY

Yeah, you know it's a shame his parents didn't get divorced thirty years ago. He could have been normal. 

GEORGE

Oh my God! (coming out of bathroom) You know what I just realized?! If they get divorced an' live in two separate places? That's twice as many visits! 

JERRY

Gee, I never thought of that. 

GEORGE

Imagine if I had to see them both on the same day? (mirthless) Haha! It's like runnin' a double marathon! 

ELAINE

Hey Georgie, did you have any idea that anything was wrong? 

JERRY

Have you ever spent any time with these people...? 

GEORGE

You know what this has to do with? 

ELAINE

What? 

GEORGE

The man in the cape--I bet you he is mixed up in this! I don't trust men in capes. 

JERRY

And you can't cast aspersions on someone just because they're wearin' a cape... Superman wore a cape... An' I'll be damned if I'm gonna stand here an' let you say something bad about him. 

GEORGE

All right Superman's the exception. 

KRAMER

Oh, hey! Elaine, I just heard that Noreen and Paul are breaking up. I want you to put in a good word for me. (to Jerry) I've always had a thing for Noreen. 

ELAINE

No, Kramer. You don't understand. This could be my fault. 

KRAMER

Well, if she's available now, I'm not gonna let her slip through my fingers this time. Nooope. (does a little dance) 

JERRY

Well it looks like you've adjusted to the boxers... 

KRAMER

Wellll, I wouldn't go as far as that. 

JERRY

You went back to the Jockeys? 

KRAMER

Wrong again. 

JERRY

(pause as he realizes) Oh, no. 

ELAINE

What? What?... 

JERRY

Don't you see what's goin' on here???... No boxers, no Jockeys... 

ELAINE

(backing away from Kramer) Eeaawww... 

JERRY

The only thing between him and us is a thin layer of gabardine... Kramer, say it isn't so. 

KRAMER

Oh, it be so. I'm out there, Jerry, an' I'm lllovin' every minute of it!!! 

JERRY

Don't you need a little... help? 

KRAMER

Surprisingly, no. I'm freee, I'm unfettered... (opens door to leave, still very happy, then) Feel like a naked innocent boy rrroamin' the countryside!! (exits) 

ELAINE

So you guys are tryin' to work it out! That's great!... 

NOREEN

Yeah, well... We're trying... But he just went insane there for a while... 

ELAINE

Oh, he went insane?... 

NOREEN

Believe it or not, Paul was convinced I was having an affair because somebody kept calling and hanging up whenever he answered! What kind of a sick person calls and hangs up over and over? 

ELAINE

(awkward, increasingly avoiding eye contact) Well. Uh. I don't know about sick. I mean, maybe it was somebody who, didn't wanna talk to whoever was answering because whoever was answering was always making boring chit-chat, an' was completely oblivious to the fact that the person who was calling, didn't want to speak to them, ah! 

NOREEN

(has been growing increasingly slackjawed in amazement) I can't believe that was you... 

ELAINE

(looks at Noreen) I'm really sorry, Noreen... 

NOREEN

(reconsidering Paul's worth) ...So you thought he was boring? 

ELAINE

Hey, Noreen, don't go by me! Ha ha. 

JERRY

What are you doin' to this woman?! This is the second relationship you've ruined for her in a few weeks!! 

ELAINE

(head in arms) I know-- 

JERRY

First you ruin her relationship with the High Talker. 

ELAINE

Well... I got confused, they sound exactly the same. 

JERRY

So she breaks up with him. Somehow picks up the pieces of her life. Miraculously meets... A New Guy! Ya bust that up! An' then, just as they're reconciling, you announce to the world: He's Boring. 

ELAINE

(apologetically) I didn't know she'd take it so seriously. 

JERRY

Well, apparently you have a tremendous influence over this woman: anything you say she does! 

JERRY

Yeah. 

DONNA

It's Donna Chang. 

JERRY

(hits button) Come on up. (opens door a little) 

ELAINE

Well, I guess I just didn't realize it... 

JERRY

Well, let's look back at your history with this woman. Okay? 

ELAINE

(like a little girl) Okay... 

JERRY

First, you encouraged her to join the army... She did. 

ELAINE

She was lost... 

JERRY

Then, you suggest she goes... AWOL! She did! 

ELAINE

Well, she didn't seem to be havin' so much fun... 

JERRY

You know... You better make sure and never tell this woman to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge... 

ELAINE

If I have this much influence over her, why don't I just call her an' tell her to get back together with him--that's aalll! 

DONNA

Hi. 

JERRY

Oh, Miss Changstein! This is Elaine... 

DONNA

Helllo...--ELAINE: Hi! How are you?) 

DONNA

(to Jerry) Guess what? Mrs. Costanza called me, they're not getting divorced. 

ELAINE

(happy gasp) Oh. 

JERRY

Why? What happened? 

DONNA

Well, she was trying to call George last night, she got me, we spoke for an hour and she changed her mind!!! 

JERRY

Wow! That's amazing! 

DONNA

Anyway, she wants to meet me! She invited me over for dinner! 

ELAINE

(off camera) Huh. 

DONNA

She said you should come too. 

JERRY

Tonight? 

DONNA

Yeah--I just remembered, I'm gonna have to cancel my acupuncture class. (goes to phone) 

GEORGE

All right. (tearing his jacket off) Let me just say one thing: there is no way that this is gonna happen. You hear me? No Way! Because if you think I'm going' to two Thanksgivings, you're out of your mind!!! 

ESTELLE

(calmly) We're not getting divorced. 

FRANK

Your mother changed her mind... (tries to catch a fly with his hand) 

GEORGE

(gleeful, to Estelle) You did?! That's Goood! That's very good! I'm very glad to hear that. 

FRANK

Yeah, we worked it out. 

GEORGE

All right. So let me ask you a question. Who was the man in the cape? 

FRANK

He was my lawyer. 

GEORGE

Your lawyer wears a cape...? 

FRANK

Yeah. So what? 

GEORGE

Who wears a cape? 

FRANK

He's very independent; he doesn't follow the trends. 

ESTELLE

He looks ridiculous in that thing... 

FRANK

(shouting) You have no eye for fashion!!! 

ESTELLE

(shouting) I have no eye for fashion?!?!?! 

GEORGE

All right! Come on! Let's not fight. 

ESTELLE

All right! All right! 

ESTELLE

Georgie's right. (pats him on the cheek) 

GEORGE

(quietly) ehh. (pausing to look at both of them) So what made you change your mind? 

ESTELLE

It was that Chinese woman. 

JERRY

So I'm curious. What'd you tell Mrs. Costanza that changed her mind? 

DONNA

I mentioned a few bits of wisdom from Confucius. 

JERRY

Confucius, huh? 

DONNA

Yeah. 

JERRY

(pause) You know, you're not Chinese... 

JERRY

Hey! I heard the good news! 

FRANK

Jerry, how come you didn't say hello to me the other day, huh?! 

JERRY

Elaine was... in a rush. 

FRANK

(to George, pointing) I knew it was Elaine!! 

DONNA

You must be Estelle. 

ESTELLE

(giggles) Yes. Who are you...? 

DONNA

I'm Donna Chang! 

ESTELLE

(steps back, appalled) You're not Chinese! 

KRAMER

Y'ello? 

ELAINE

Paul? 

KRAMER

Elaine! 

ELAINE

Kramer? 

KRAMER

(pause) YEAHH! 

ELAINE

What are you doin' there? 

KRAMER

Wellll, isn't it obvious? 

ELAINE

(scoffs) Uh, is Noreen there? 

KRAMER

Yes she is... 

ELAINE

(pause) Well... Can I talk to her? 

KRAMER

Oh, what? Am I... tooo boring for you? 

ELAINE

(losing patience) Alright--would you just put her on? 

KRAMER

Well, I feel that it would be best that you didn't talk to Noreen for a while... 

ELAINE

YOU feel? 

KRAMER

That's right! She an' I have had a very long talk. An' I was appalled to learn of the destructive influence you've had over her life, lo these many years... 

ELAINE

What, are you insane?! 

KRAMER

From now on, I'll be calling the shots around here... 

ELAINE

Uh! Ho-ho. An' what are YOU gonna tell her? 

KRAMER

Well. I've encouraged her to go back into the Army...(Noreen sighs a little) There she'll get the structure an' the discipline she needs right now... And she'll have qualified officers telling her what to do... 

ELAINE

(sighs) Kramer! You have GOT to let me talk to her! 

KRAMER

Can't help ya, kid. 

ELAINE

Get the-- (Kramer puts phone down) 

ESTELLE

You're not Chinese!?!? 

DONNA

...No. 

ESTELLE

I thought you were Chinese!! 

DONNA

I'm from Long Island. 

ESTELLE

Long Island?!?! I thought I was gettin' advice from a Chinese woman!! 

DONNA

I'm sorry...? 

ESTELLE

Well... then... that changes everything! 

GEORGE

What?! 

ESTELLE

She's not Chinese; I was duped!! 

GEORGE

So what?! She still gave you advice; what's the difference if she's not Chinese?!?! 

ESTELLE

I'm not taking advice from some girl from Long Island!! (goes into another room) 

GEORGE

(chases after her) Wait a minute! You're--now you're getting a divorce because she's from Long Island?!?! 

FRANK

(shouts after them) You want a divorce?!!? You got one!!! 

JERRY

(pause, to Donna) You know, you might wanna think about changin' your name... 

ELAINE

So, ever since she started dating Kramer, she won't even talk to me! 

JERRY

Well--Noreen listened to you like George's mother listened to the Chinese. (buys a newspaper out of a machine) 

ELAINE

(pause) You know, everybody listens to the Chinese. I mean, look at the fortune cookie. You couldn't get away with that in any other restaurant. 

ELAINE

(quietly) hu_uh, (pause) You know, everybody listens to the Chinese. I mean, look at the fortune cookie. You couldn't get away with that in any other restaurant. 

JERRY

Yeah, no one's reading any rolled-up messages in a knish... 

GEORGE

Oh, it had to happen!! 

JERRY

Hey. 

GEORGE

I knew it!! (shuts cab door) I predicted it! (hits cab roof twice, it drives off) Saw both of them today! What a disaster! I'm runnin' all over Queens. First I saw my mother. We had lunch together. Never had... LUNCH with my mother before--it's like a date! Then we drive down to Kew Gardens! Tons of traffic! I see my father. We played 'Clue'! All day with this! [Kew Gardens (see links at end of script)] 

KRAMER

(triumphant) Hey, Jerry! Guess what! The Kramer name might live on! Noreen's late! She's laaate!! (give two thumbs up) 

NOREEN

(surprised) Who are you?! 

MAN

I'm Frank Costanza's lawyer. (He starts pulling her to safety) 

JERRY

So, she got you to join a book club? 

GEORGE

I got a feeling I'm gonna be much smarter than you pretty soon. 

JERRY

Well, I think that statement alone reflects your burgeoning intelligence. (Sits on a couch.) Hey, what about this one? 

GEORGE

Nah, I don't like that one. 

JERRY

So, what's your first book? 

GEORGE

'Breakfast At Tiffany's.' 90 pages. (Waves a hand like it's nothing.) 

JERRY

It's kinda old, isn't it? 

GEORGE

They wanted to read a Truman Capote book. 

JERRY

Oh, sure...Truman Capote. 

GEORGE

He's a great writer. 

JERRY

Oh, yeah. 

GEORGE

Did you ever read anything by him? 

JERRY

No. You? 

GEORGE

Nah. 

JERRY

Oh, what about this one? Look at this, this is it! This is what I'm looking for. (Sits on the couch.) Oh, yeah! 

ELAINE

Hey, what's going on? 

JERRY

New couch, baby! 

ELAINE

New couch? Why? 

JERRY

I love this couch. You know what the best part about it is? It doesn't fold out, so no one can sleep over. 

ELAINE

Hello. 

CARL

Hello. 

ELAINE

Oh, let me get the door for you. (They carry the couch out the door.) Ooh, be careful! 

JERRY

Wait till you see it, it's perfect. The guy told me it's one of a kind, they stopped making it. 

ELAINE

What are you doing with your old couch? 

JERRY

Nothing, the moving guys are taking it. Why, you want it? 

ELAINE

Yeah, I'll take it. 

JERRY

Well, I'm sure that they can deliver it to your apartment. 

ELAINE

Yes, they can. (Kramer enters.) 

KRAMER

Hey! Couch is comin.' 

JERRY

It's here! 

KRAMER

Alright! Yeah. You know, I'm excited about this, Jerry. In a way, I feel like I'm getting a new couch. 

JERRY

Yeah. So do I. 

KRAMER

Ooh! Remember Poppie? 

JERRY

Oh, you mean from Poppie's Restaurant? 

KRAMER

Yeah, yeah. Anyway, uh...we're going into business together. Remember that idea I had a few years ago about the pizza place where you make your own pizza? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

ELAINE

What was that again? 

KRAMER

It's a pizza place where you make your own pie! We give you the dough, the sauce, the cheese...you pound it, slap it, you flip it up into the air...you put your toppings on and you slide it into the oven! Sounds good, huh? 

ELAINE

Ooh, I can't wait to get me a fella and make mah own pie! 

JERRY

What made you resurrect that old idea? 

KRAMER

Well, I happened to be eating at Poppie's when I told him the 'old' idea, and his eyes - waaaaaah! - just lit up. You know, he wants to back it. 

ELAINE

I heard Poppie's was good, let's go. 

JERRY

I'm not goin' there. Didn't he get busted by the Board of Health? 

KRAMER

That was in the past, Jerry. As it happens, New York Magazine just judged his kitchen to be one of the cleanest in the city. They got a duck there, you think you died and went to heaven. 

ELAINE

Ooh! I love duck. C'mon, c'mon! 

KRAMER

Yeah, but you gotta order it two days in advance. (To Jerry) You know, I'm gonna call him, I'm gonna order the duck for you. 

JERRY

Oh, Kramer, I - 

JERRY

Right there, guys. That's perfect. Ah? Whatta ya think, Lainie? 

ELAINE

Well, I don't know. I'll have to sit on it. 

JERRY

Oh no, I don't want anyone sitting on it. 

CARL

Sign here. 

ELAINE

Excuse me, I was wondering if would it be possible if you could deliver the old couch to my apartment? It's not very far. 

CARL

Sure. 

ELAINE

'Kay. You, uh...you got room in the truck for me? 

CARL

Yeah, I think we can squeeze you in. 

ELAINE

Oh, goody. Okay, well uh...(to Jerry and Kramer)...I'll see you chumps later. (Elaine and Carl exit.) 

KRAMER

Did you offer those guys a drink? 

JERRY

Uh, no. Should I have? 

KRAMER

What kind of a person are you? 

JERRY

I don't know. 

GEORGE

Okay. 'Breakfast At Tiffany's.' (Begins to read, but gradually his attention is drawn to the TV Guide on the end table. George realizes there's a show on he wants to see by looking at his watch, and doesn't start the book.) 

ELAINE

So, he puts the couch down, and just as he's about to leave he says, 'Do you date moving men?' 

JERRY

Ah ha... 

ELAINE

You wanna know what I said? 

JERRY

I can't wait. 

ELAINE

'I do now.' 

JERRY

Clever. 

ELAINE

Is that something? 

JERRY

Yes. 

ELAINE

Is that something? 

JERRY

You're something. So anyway, when they were in my house before, I didn't offer them anything to drink. 

ELAINE

Well, they're real men, Jerry. They get sweaty. 

JERRY

So, anyone sweaty comes into your house has to be offered a drink? 

ELAINE

Yes. 

JERRY

Well, would you apologize for me? (Elaine nods. Poppie comes out of the kitchen.) 

POPPIE

Hello! Jerry, so good to see you again! (Puts his hand out.) 

JERRY

Hello, Poppie. This is Elaine. 

ELAINE

Nice to meet you, Poppie. 

POPPIE

Let me show you to your table. (Leads Jerry and Elaine to the table.) Your duck is cooking as we speak. It is so succulent...so succulent! 

JERRY

Well, Kramer told us all about your business venture together. 

POPPIE

Your friend and I are going to make a lot of money. Of course, I already have a lot of money. Poppie does very well...very well. 

ELAINE

Well, your mother must be very proud of you. 

POPPIE

My mother...was taken from my house by the Communists in the middle of the night when I was ten years old. She was sent to a slave labor camp, where she labored for twelve years. Finally, they released her and she was on a boat to America to re-unite with us...but she was served some bad fish, and she died...on the high seas. 

JERRY

So, what's good tonight? 

ELAINE

Boy, I'm really looking forward to this duck. I've never had food ordered in advance before. 

JERRY

Ah, I could've stayed home and ordered a pizza from Paccino's. 

ELAINE

Paccino's? Oh no. You should never order pizza from Paccino's. 

JERRY

Why not? 

ELAINE

Because, the owner contributes a lot of money to those fanatical, anti-abortion groups. 

JERRY

So, you won't eat the pizza? 

ELAINE

No way. 

JERRY

Really. 

ELAINE

Yeah. 

JERRY

Well, what if Poppie felt the same way? 

ELAINE

Well, I guess I wouldn't eat here, then. 

JERRY

Really! 

ELAINE

Yeah. That's right. 

JERRY

Well, perhaps we should inquire. Poppie! Oh, Poppie. Could I have a word? (Poppie comes over.) 

POPPIE

Yes, Jerry. I just checked your duck...it is more succulent than even I had hoped. 

JERRY

Poppie, I was just curious...where do you stand on the abortion issue? 

POPPIE

When my mother was abducted by the Communists, she was with child... 

JERRY

Oh, boy. 

POPPIE

...but the Communists, they put an end to that! So, on this issue there is no debate! And no intelligent person can think differently. 

ELAINE

Well...Poppie. I think differently. 

POPPIE

And what gives you the right to do that? 

ELAINE

The Supreme Court gives me the right to do that! Let's go Jerry, c'mon. 

TABLE

I heard that. Let's go, Henry. 

HENRY

But we just got here... 

TABLE

I'm with you, Poppie! 

TABLE

Let's go! 

ELAINE

And I am not coming back! 

POPPIE

You're not welcome! 

JERRY

Well, I'm certainly glad I brought it up. (Gets up and leaves.) 

JERRY

Well, you should have seen it. It was quite a scene over there. 

GEORGE

I'm sorry I missed it. 

JERRY

Oh, you really missed something. And I have to say...it was pretty much all my fault. (Jerry smiles. George laughs.) So, how's the book coming? (George's laughs taper off...) I say, how's the book comin'? 

GEORGE

Oh...pretty good. 

JERRY

So, what's it about? 

GEORGE

Well, it's about Holly Go-Lightly. 

JERRY

Holly Go-Lightly. 

GEORGE

Yeah, she's quite a character. 

JERRY

Yes, you haven't read a page, have you? 

GEORGE

No. 

JERRY

Big surprise. 

GEORGE

I couldn't. You know, if it's not about sports, I find it very hard to concentrate. 

JERRY

You're not very bright, are you? 

GEORGE

No, I'm not. I would like to be, but I'm not. What am I gonna do? The book club meets in a few days. 

JERRY

Why don't you rent the movie? 

GEORGE

'Why don't I rent the movie.' See, this is when I like you. Alright, now I'm relieved. (Kramer enters and comes over to the booth.) 

KRAMER

So...how was the dinner last night? 

JERRY

Oh...well... 

KRAMER

Did you enjoy the duck? (Elaine comes back from the bathroom.) Oh, Elaine! I was just asking how dinner went last night. 

ELAINE

Oh...well... 

KRAMER

Alright, what did you do to Poppie? 

ELAINE

Nothing. 

KRAMER

Well, he's in the hospital. And the cook says you put him there. 

ELAINE

What's wrong with him? 

KRAMER

I don't know! I'm gonna go and visit him later. (angrily) It would be nice if you got him something. (Punches the the table to accentuate this, and leaves.) 

JERRY

We should get him something. 

ELAINE

Yeah. You're right. 

ELAINE

Do you know that I have been using the same bottle of shampoo for a year? And I shampoo every day. (Carl smiles.) So, what do you think of my conversation? 

CARL

Not much! (They both laugh.) I, uh, would have invited you up, but I don't have any furniture. 

ELAINE

You don't have any furniture? 

CARL

No, I hate furniture. I can't look at it. (They laugh again.) 

ELAINE

Well, I can understand that. Pretty good date, huh? 

CARL

Yeah! No heavy lifting. (Elaine and Carl look into each others eyes, then kiss.) 

KRAMER

Anyway, Jerry and Elaine felt very badly about what happened to you, and they wanted you to have this. 

POPPIE

What's this? A bottle of wine and a five-alarm chili? They're trying to kill Poppie?! 

KRAMER

Why, what...? 

POPPIE

Don't they know I have a gastro-intestinal disorder? If I would have any of this, I would die. Then Poppie's no good to anyone! This is a sick, sick joke on Poppie. How could you be friends with those two? 

KRAMER

Well, we're not very close. 

POPPIE

They owe me for those ducks. They were flown in from Newfoundland. 

KRAMER

Oh, they got good ducks there, huh? 

POPPIE

Oh, very good ducks. 

ELAINE

I'm in looove! 

JERRY

Whoa! 

ELAINE

This is it, Jerry! This is it! He is such an incredible person! He's real, he's honest, he's unpretentious...oh, I'm really lucky! 

JERRY

Did you tell him I was sorry I didn't offer him the drink? 

ELAINE

No, I forgot. And, the best part is, he doesn't play games. You know? There are no games! (Sits down on the couch.) 

JERRY

No games? What is the point of dating without games? How do you know if you're winning or losing? 

ELAINE

Well, all I know is, he doesn't like games and he doesn't play games, you know? He has too much character and integrity. 

JERRY

Ah ha. And what is his stand on abortion? 

ELAINE

What? 

JERRY

What is his stand...on abortion? 

ELAINE

Well, I'm sure he's pro-choice. 

JERRY

How do you know? 

ELAINE

Because he, well...he's just so good-looking. 

JERRY

Well, you should probably ask, because if he's gonna be coming over with those Paccino's pizzas...could be trouble. 

GEORGE

I'd like to rent Breakfast At Tiffany's. 

CLERK

Uh, this is out. Someone has it. 

GEORGE

Out? Oh no, I've been to four other places, you're the only ones that have had it. 

CLERK

Well, I could put it on reserve for you, if you'd like. 

GEORGE

Maybe we could call them and ask them to return it. 

CLERK

Oh, sorry. We can't do that. 

GEORGE

Well, maybe they're done with it. I could go pick it up. 

CLERK

I don't think so. It doesn't work that way. 

INTERCOM

Yes? 

GEORGE

Uh, excuse me, are you Joe Temple? 

INTERCOM

Yes. 

GEORGE

Uh, yes, uh...you don't know me, my name is George Costanza...did you happen to rent Breakfast At Tiffany's? 

KRAMER

Hey. 

JERRY

Hey, what's happenin.' 

KRAMER

Well, you know, Poppie's over at my place. Tonight's the big night. I'm gonna make the first test pizza at the restaurant. 

JERRY

You got a regular 'Manhattan Project' going on over there. 

KRAMER

Yeah. Anyway, he's about to leave, he wants the duck money. (Poppie enters.) 

JERRY

Okay. Hi, Poppie. 

POPPIE

Hello. 

JERRY

I'm sorry about the gift, I didn't know about your condition. 

POPPIE

That's fine. If you just give me my duck money, I'll be on my way. 

JERRY

Okay. I'll get it. (Goes into the bedroom.) 

KRAMER

Why don't you sit down, Poppie? You're still recuperating. (Poppie moves to the sofa and sits down, and exhales a loud sigh of relief.) What, are you tired, Poppie? 

POPPIE

No. 

KRAMER

Hey, Poppie...you really think people wanna make their own pizza? 

POPPIE

Kramer, did I ever tell you about my mother? My mother - 

JERRY

Here you go. (Poppie stands up and takes the money.) Anyway, I'm sorry again about the...(notices a large, wet stain on his couch)...the...the... 

POPPIE

The what? (Looks at Kramer, and exits.) 

JERRY

...the...the... 

KRAMER

So long. I'll see you tonight. 

JERRY

Kramer, Kramer, what is this?! 

KRAMER

What is what? 

JERRY

This puddle on my sofa! 

KRAMER

What puddle? 

JERRY

That puddle! (Kramer sees the puddle and does a double-take.) 

KRAMER

I don't know. 

JERRY

Is it...? Could it...? Could he have...? IT IS! (Grabs Kramer.) Poppie peed on my sofa!! 

KRAMER

Are you sure? 

JERRY

Well, what is it then?! My new sofa! Poppie peed on my new sofa! 

KRAMER

I'm sure it'll come out. 

JERRY

I don't care if it comes out, I can't sit on that anymore! 

KRAMER

Ah, you're making too much of it. 

JERRY

Yeah, you're right. It's just a natural human function...happens to be on my sofa, instead of in the toilet, where it would normally be. 

KRAMER

Right! 

GEORGE

Well, anyway, the book club meets tomorrow, Mr. Temple. 

JOE

Well, I was going to watch it with my daughter. She likes Audrey Hepburn very much. 

GEORGE

She was a delicate flower. 

JOE

Why didn't you just read the book? 

GEORGE

Well, as I say, the pink-eye made my vision...quite blurry... (Joe's daughter comes to the door.) 

JOE

Remy, this is George. Would you mind if he watched Breakfast At Tiffany's with us? (George smiles at Remy. Remy looks at Joe doubtfully.) 

CARL

Hi. 

ELAINE

Hi. (They kiss.) 

CARL

I missed you. 

ELAINE

Oh, I missed you! 

CARL

I don't remember the last time I felt this way. 

ELAINE

Me, either! 

CARL

I think about you all the time. 

ELAINE

You do? 

CARL

Do you think about me? 

ELAINE

Oh yeah, all the time, all the time...although, recently I've been thinking about this friend of mine. 

CARL

What friend? 

ELAINE

Oh, just this woman...she got impregnated by her troglodytic half-brother, and decided to have an abortion. (Waits in suspense for what Carl's response will be.) 

CARL

You know, someday...we're going to get enough people in the Supreme Court to change that law. 

GEORGE

So, anything to uh, nosh? 

JOE

What did you want? 

GEORGE

Popcorn? 

REMY

Popcorn? Where do you think you are? 

GEORGE

Well, a lot of people keep popcorn in the house. 

REMY

Well, we don't. 

GEORGE

You might want to try it...makes the movie more enjoyable, that's all. 

JOE

Here's some nuts. 

GEORGE

Oh! Nuts! Excellent! You know what I love? How there's two nuts named after people. Hazel...and filbert. 

REMY

Can we watch the movie now, Daddy? (Joe presses play on the remote.) 

GEORGE

Hey, let's turn off the lights, get some real 'movie atmosphere.' 

JOE

The lights are fine. (George shrugs, and the movie begins.) 

KRAMER

See, anybody can do this. (Tosses pizza dough into the air.) 

POPPIE

Use your wrist! It's all in the wrist. (Kramer tosses the dough way up there.) Not too high! 

KRAMER

Alright, put a little sauce on here... (speaks some unintelligible words in an Italian accent while spreading the sauce around.) Some cheese... 

POPPIE

Not too much! 

KRAMER

And...cucumbers! (Grabs a large handful and puts them on the pizza.) 

POPPIE

Wait a second...what is that? 

KRAMER

It's cucumbers. 

POPPIE

No, no. You can't put cucumbers on a pizza. 

KRAMER

Well, why not? I like cucumbers. 

POPPIE

That's not a pizza. It'll taste terrible. 

KRAMER

But that's the idea, you make your own pie. 

POPPIE

Yes, but we cannot give the people the right to choose any topping they want! Now on this issue there can be no debate! 

KRAMER

What gives you the right to tell me how I would make my pie? 

POPPIE

Because it's a pizza! 

KRAMER

It's not a pizza until it comes out of the oven! 

POPPIE

It's a pizza the moment you put your fists in the dough! 

KRAMER

No, it isn't! 

POPPIE

Yes, it is! 

WIFE

I'm home. 

JOE

Hey, honey. 

REMY

Hi, Mom. 

WIFE

Hi, baby. (To George.) Hello. Breakfast At Tiffany's? 

JOE

Yeah. 

WIFE

Well, I just came back from Angela's, it's not looking very good for Duncan. 

JOE

Aw, that's too bad. 

WIFE

Yeah, the doctor thinks it's just a matter of time - 

GEORGE

Joe...could you... 

WIFE

Poor guy, I hate to see him suffer like this... 

GEORGE

You know, I'm sorry, I...I hate to be one of those people, but we're right in the middle of this thing...I can't hear. 

WIFE

Who are you? 

JOE

This is George Costanza. 

GEORGE

This is very hard to follow with all the talking. 

JOE

I'll pause it, okay? (Pauses the tape with the remote.) 

GEORGE

Any more grape juice? (Gets up and goes to the kitchen. Remy moves to the end of the couch where George was sitting.) 

WIFE

Who is this guy? 

REMY

He's in some book club. 

WIFE

And what's he doing here? 

REMY

Cheating on his test. (George returns from the kitchen with a glass of grape juice.) 

GEORGE

So, we watching the movie, or are we still talking? (Joe's wife shakes her head and goes into the other room. George gestures to Remy to move.) Okay, c'mon. Let's go. 

REMY

What? 

GEORGE

C'mon, you took my seat. 

REMY

It's not your seat. 

GEORGE

I was sitting there, c'mon. 

REMY

You didn't save it. 

GEORGE

I had the arm! Joe... 

JOE

What's the difference? 

GEORGE

Well, I was very comfortable! I've got my nuts here... 

REMY

It's my couch. 

GEORGE

Alright, c'mon, scooch over. (Tries to squeeze into the corner seat of the couch and struggles with Remy. He spills his glass of grape juice all over the couch in the process.) 

REMY

Look! Look what you did! You got grape juice all over our couch, you've ruined our couch! (Joe slowly walks toward George with his hands on his hips.) 

GEORGE

Joe... 

ELAINE

Oh my god. 

JERRY

You see?! 

ELAINE

So, you're gonna get a new couch? 

JERRY

Well, I guess I have no choice. 

ELAINE

Do you want your old couch back? 

JERRY

I was hoping you'd offer. (The intercom buzzes, Jerry answers it.) Yeah? 

INTERCOM

It's the movers. 

JERRY

'Kay. (Buzzes them in.) 

ELAINE

Who's that? 

JERRY

Your boyfriend, he's taking it out. 

ELAINE

No, no, he's not my boyfriend. 

JERRY

Why? 

ELAINE

Take a guess. 

JERRY

Oh, really. (Carl and another moving guy come in and pick up the couch.) 

ELAINE

Hi. 

CARL

Hi. 

JERRY

Hey Carl, I also need you to go to Elaine's and bring my old couch back. 

CARL

Today? 

JERRY

Could you? 

CARL

Sure. 

ELAINE

What are you doing with this couch? 

JERRY

George is taking it. 

ELAINE

Did you tell him it was peed on? 

JERRY

He said he doesn't care, he'll just turn the cushion over. 

CARL

I'm sorry you feel that way, Elaine. 

ELAINE

Yeah, me too. 

CARL

It's just too bad. 

ELAINE

Yeah. It is. 

CARL

Well, I better get this couch back to Jerry's. 

ELAINE

Can I offer you anything to drink? 

CARL

Yeah, sure. 

ELAINE

All I've got is grape juice. 

CARL

Throw it! 

CARL

The couch! 

MARIE

She didn't want the constraints of any relationship, that's why she got rid of the cat. The most important thing in Holly's life was her independence. 

GEORGE

Well, not really. After all, she did get together with George Peppard. I mean, Fred. 

MARIE

George...Fred's gay. 

JERRY

I cannot believe Lindsay's still seeing you after that 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' thing. 

GEORGE

I think she finds my stupidity charming. 

JERRY

As we all do. 

GEORGE

Yeah, anyway, she's uh, having some kind of a family lunch, I'll swing by after. 

JERRY

Oh, so you're gonna meet the mother? 

GEORGE

Yeah, I'll zip in, 'How do you do?', zip out. She'll love me. 

JERRY

You're good with the mothers. 

GEORGE

Y'know, I'm better with the mothers than I am with the daughters. 

JERRY

Maybe you should date the mothers. 

GEORGE

Well, if I could talk to the mothers and have sex with the daughters, then I'd really have something goin'. 

JERRY

Oh, you got something goin'. 

GEORGE

Yeah. 

KRAMER

(enters apartment) Hey. 

GEORGE

Hey! (heads toward bathroom) 

KRAMER

Hey, you got a hammer? 

JERRY

What do you need a hammer for? 

KRAMER

Well, I got this new poster. 3-D art? Computers generate 'em. 

JERRY

Oh, yeah! I wanna see that. Bring it over. 

KRAMER

No, no, I don't have it now. I gotta pick it up at Mr. Pitt's. Elaine was framing a bunch of stuff for him, so she did me a favor. What, you wanna take a ride? 

JERRY

Nah, I don't think so. 

KRAMER

(shouting to the bathroom door) George, you wanna go for a ride? 

GEORGE

(inside bathroom) Nah. 

KRAMER

Oh, COME ON! 

JERRY

Hey, could you wait until the man finishes? 

KRAMER

All right, I've had it with you two. (opens apartment door to leave) 

JERRY

Hey, guess what? Remember that woman you saw me with the other day? You know, she used to be an Olympic gymnast? 

KRAMER

A gymnast! 

JERRY

Yeah, she's Romanian, she won a silver at the '84 Olympics. 

KRAMER

A gymnast, Jerry. Think of the flexibility. Mmm, that sex'll melt your face. 

JERRY

Yeah, well, I think I'm bailing. 

KRAMER

(shuts door) 'Bailing'? 

JERRY

Yeah, you know, Kramer, there's always a price to pay for just a sexual dalliance. 

KRAMER

Jerry, you should pay that price. 

JERRY

She's Romanian. What am I gonna talk to her about, Ceausescu? 

KRAMER

Ch- oo-... what? 

GEORGE

(emerging from bathroom, buttoning his shirt) A gymnast! I can't believe it, you didn't tell me she was a gymnast. 

JERRY

(watching George buttoning his shirt) What is this? 

GEORGE

What, I'm puttin' my shirt back on. 

JERRY

(stares at George, incredulous) 'Back on'? What was it doing off? 

GEORGE

I take it off when I go to the, uh, y'know, to the 'office'. 

JERRY

(laughing) What for? 

GEORGE

Well, it frees me up. No encumbrances. 

JERRY

Unbuttoned, or all the way off? 

GEORGE

ALL the way, baby! 

JERRY

Of course. 

KRAMER

(convulses in pain) Yeow! Whoa. 

JERRY

What, again? Kramer, if you keep getting these attacks, you should see the doctor and have it checked out. 

KRAMER

(exiting apartment) Yeah, yeah, yeah... 

JERRY

(picks up newspaper, turns to George) You always take the shirt off? 

GEORGE

Always. 

JERRY

Boy, I tell ya', knowing you is like going out in the jungle. I never know what I'm going to find next, and I'm real scared. 

PITT

Elaine, I need you to proofread this report for my meeting with the Poland Creek Bottled Water people. 

ELAINE

What meeting? 

PITT

I told you. I sit on the Board of Trustees for Morgan Springs, and we're trying to acquire Poland Creek. 

ELAINE

Oh! (tries to take paper) 

PITT

(pulls away) Are you using a fountain pen? 

ELAINE

Yes? 

PITT

They smear! Under no circumstances is ink to be used in this office. 

ELAINE

All right! I'll use a pencil, Mr. Pitt. 

KRAMER

Elaine? 

ELAINE

Come in, come in! 

KRAMER

Yeah. (enters, points at package) Yah, huh? 

ELAINE

Ah, right there, yeah. 

KRAMER

(rips open package) Yeah, that's... 

ELAINE

Kramer, it's... 

KRAMER

(holds up framed picture): There she blows! (throws paper around) 

ELAINE

Kramer, Kramer, can you do this at home? I've got, I've got work to do, okay? 

KRAMER

Oh, these are nice corners, huh? 

PITT

Elaine, did I hear... (sees Kramer) Oh, this is very odd. 

KRAMER

(looking at picture) Yeah, it's 3-D art. Computers generate 'em. BIG computers. 

PITT

Yes, I've heard about these. How do they work? 

KRAMER

Well, you blur your eyes like you're starin' straight through the picture. And you keep your eyes unfocused. And then... (Kramer and Pitt stare at picture) Oh, oh, oh, YEAH! 

PITT

I don't see it. 

KRAMER

Yeah, it's a spaceship, surrounded by planets, asteroids... 

PITT

I still don't see it. 

ELAINE

Okay, Kramer, that's enough. Mr. Pitt has got work to do. 

KRAMER

Ya' ever dream in 3-D? It's like the boogeyman is comin' right at you. 

PITT

A spaceship, where? 

KRAMER

(pointing) Right in here. Just keep your eyes unfocused. (convulses in pain) Waahh! Oh, mama! 

ELAINE

Kramer, what's wrong? 

KRAMER

Mama! 

ELAINE

Kramer, Kramer, are you okay? 

KRAMER

I think I gotta go to the doctor! (exits) Oh, mama! 

PITT

(still staring at picture) How long does it usually take? 

ENRIGHT

Oh, George, it is so nice to finally meet you. And I'm sorry we've kept Lindsay so long. 

LINDSAY

Mother... 

GEORGE

Oh, no, no, not at all. No, I have always felt that the most important thing in the world is spending time with family. 

ENRIGHT

Oh? Are you and your family close? 

GEORGE

(hesitates) Very close, yes. Almost painfully close. 

LINDSAY

Mother, I'm going to walk Nana and Aunt Phyllis to the elevator. George, do you mind waiting just one more minute? 

GEORGE

Mind? Why would I mind? I would love to wait! (shakes hands with Nana) Nana, nice to see you. Ni-ni-ni-ni-NANA! (embraces another guest, kisses her) Aunt Phyllis, always a pleasure. What a pleasure! Hey, let's do this again real soon. I had fun, huh? 

ENRIGHT

Can I offer you anything to eat? 

GEORGE

Oh, no no no, I'm fine. Let me help you with these dishes, huh? 

ENRIGHT

Oh no, George, you don't have to... 

GEORGE

No, I know I don't have to, I want to. 

ENRIGHT

George, you are such a gentleman. 

GEORGE

I'd argue if I could, Mrs. Enright. (exits) Here we go, all right. 

ENRIGHT

(wide-eyed) Oh... 

GEORGE

(spits out mouthful of food): Mrs. Enright! Mrs. Enright! 

ELAINE

(pointing at 3-D picture) Look, there's a spaceship! That is so cool! 

PITT

Where is it? 

ELAINE

(pointing) Right here. 

PITT

I'm looking there! 

ELAINE

No, no, unfocus. 

PITT

I am unfocused! 

ELAINE

(answering phone) Hello? Oh, yeah, okay fine. Uh, he'll be right down. (to Pitt) Car's here to pick you up and take you to the meeting. 

PITT

(still staring at picture) Meeting? 

ELAINE

Yeah, the Poland Creek merger? 

PITT

Why don't you go for me? 

ELAINE

How can I go? 

PITT

Oh, all they're gonna do is read the report. 

ELAINE

Mr. Pitt, I do not think that is such a good idea. 

PITT

Oh, DAMN this thing! 

JERRY

(trying desperately to make conversation) So, Ceausescu. He must've been some dictator. 

KATYA

Oh yes. He was not shy about dictating. 

JERRY

He, uh, he must've been dictating first thing in the morning. 'I want a cup of coffee and a muffin!' 

KATYA

And you could not refuse. 

JERRY

No, you'd have to be crazy. 

KATYA

He was a very bad dictator. 

JERRY

Yes. Very bad. Very, very bad. 

JERRY

So lemme get this straight: you find yourself in the kitchen. You see an &eacute;clair, in the receptacle. And you think to yourself, 'What the hell, I'll just eat some trash.' 

GEORGE

No, no. No, no, no. It was not trash! 

JERRY

Was it in the trash? 

GEORGE

Yes. 

JERRY

Then it was trash. 

GEORGE

It wasn't down in, it was sort of on top. 

JERRY

But it was in the cylinder! 

GEORGE

Above the rim. 

JERRY

Adjacent to refuse, is refuse. 

GEORGE

It was on a magazine! And it still had the doily on. 

JERRY

Was it eaten? 

GEORGE

One little bite. 

JERRY

Well, that's garbage. 

GEORGE

But I know who took the bite. It was her aunt! 

JERRY

Well, you, my friend, have crossed the line that divides Man and Bum. You are now a Bum. 

JERRY

Hey! 

KRAMER

Hey. 

JERRY

What's with you? 

KRAMER

I got a stone. 

JERRY

What stone? 

KRAMER

A kidney stone. 

JERRY

What is that, anyway? 

KRAMER

It's a, it's a stony mineral concretion, formed abnormally in the kidney. And this jagged shard of calcium pushes its way through the ureter into the bladder. It's forced out through the urine! 

JERRY

Oh, that's gotta hurt. 

ARONSON

Our shareholders have given basic approval for the merger, including the stock swap. 

ELAINE

Ah. The 'stock swap'. Let's swap some stock. (giggles) 

BECK

And if you'll just give this to Mr. Pitt, and tell him we expect to be in full-scale production by the spring. 

ELAINE

All right. (standing up) Hey, you guys--what's the name of the new company gonna be? 

BECK

Moland Spring. 

ELAINE

(making a face) 'Moland'? 

ARONSON

Yes, we combined Morgan and Poland. 

ELAINE

Yeah, I know, but... 'Moland'? I wouldn't drink anything called 'Moland'. 

ARONSON

But it was Mr. Pitt's idea. 

ELAINE

Oh! Well, ah, what's in a name? I mean, water's water. Right? 

ARONSON

(to Beck) We've got to do something about that name. 

GEORGE

(on phone, as Jerry gestures beside him) No, Lindsay, it was not IN the garbage. It was above the garbage. Hovering. Like an angel. Of course I know your aunt bit it. I kissed her goodbye. Listen, can I tell you something else? In my family, we used to eat out of the garbage all the time. (Jerry makes a face) It was no big thing. That's right. Oh, okay. Buh-bye. (hangs up phone) I'm back in, she gave me a second chance. 

JERRY

Good for you. 

GEORGE

Yes, good for me! 

JERRY

Y'know what you should do now? Get her some flowers, smooth it out. 

GEORGE

Yes, flowers. I will get her flowers, I will go to the florist! 

KRAMER

(enters apartment, holding up videotape) Behold! The Games of the '84 Olympiad! Katya's silver medal performance! (inserts tape into VCR, sets up TV) 

JERRY

Kramer, are you still on this? I've seen gymnasts. I know what they do. It's not going to make any difference. 

KRAMER

Jerry, what is your problem? 

JERRY

Kramer, y'know, guys like you, with no conscience, don't know what it's like for guys like me. I'm in the unfortunate position of having to consider people's feelings. 

KRAMER

All right, Jerry--are you familiar with the Kama Sutra? 

JERRY

No. 

KRAMER

Tantric yoga? 

JERRY

No. 

KRAMER

Jerry, you stand on the threshold to the magical world of sensual delights that most men dare not dream of! 

JERRY

Boy, you can really talk some trash. (to George) I guess that's better than eating it. 

KRAMER

All right, all right, why don't we just watch the tape? (starts playback) 

JERRY

All right. 

GEORGE

Did you pass your stone yet? 

KRAMER

Not yet. But the suspense is killing me. 

JERRY

(pointing at TV) Hey, that's her! 

KRAMER

Oh yeah. Oh yeah, that's her. (feminine grunts and sighs can be heard as they watch the tape) Look at the height, Jerry, the extension! Now watch the tuck. Handstand, half-turn, giant into a straddle, back into another handstand. Nice kip. Reverse hecht. Oh, nice leg extension, good form! Now, here comes the big dismount. Look at the rotation, full in, double back, and she sticks the landing! (gets up to leave as George and Jerry continue to watch, mouths agape) Perhaps you'd like to keep the tape? (silence) Well, I'll take that as a yes. 

JERRY

(smiling and excited) Well, here we are. 

KATYA

Yes. We are here. 

JERRY

How did you stay on that beam like that? (holds up hand) I mean, it's only this wide! 

KATYA

I can balance myself in any position. 

KATYA

It is amazing after years of training how one can contort one's body. Of course, it is only useful in gymnastics. 

JERRY

Oh boy... 

JERRY

I couldn't believe it. Uh, I mean I thought I was entering a 'magical world' of sensual delights, but it was just so ordinary. I mean, there was nothing gymnastic about it. 

ELAINE

Well, what did you think she was gonna do? 

JERRY

Well, you know. I mean... I dunno. 

ELAINE

No, what? 

JERRY

Well, obviously I prefer not to mention any, you know... 

ELAINE

What did you think, she was going to take some of that chalk and... 

JERRY

You see, now I really don't want to get into this, any kind of specifics... 

ELAINE

Oh, come on. One thing? One thing! What? 

JERRY

Well... Frankly, I thought, you know, I was gonna kinda' be like the apparatus. 

KRAMER

You mean like the uneven parallel bars? 

JERRY

See, again, I really don't feel that... 

ELAINE

The balance beam? 

JERRY

Could we stop? 

ELAINE

(gasps in mock surprise) Not the pommel horse? 

JERRY

All right. Let's just drop it. 

JERRY

So lemme ask you this: how long would you say I have to put in now because of, you know, last night. 

ELAINE

I dunno, at least three weeks. 

JERRY

(sarcastic) Oh, great. 

ELAINE

Jerry, that is such small potatoes. I think that I may have single-handedly put the kibosh on the big water merger. 

JERRY

Between Poland and Morgan? 

ELAINE

Yeah. Started a big name controversy. 

JERRY

Kramer! The stone! 

JERRY

What happened, did you pass the stone? 

KRAMER

(Off-screen) No, I tried to do a reverse hecht off my couch and I didn't make it. 

GEORGE

(singing as he exits florist with bouquet and a cup of coffee) '...tootsie, good-bye. Too-too, tootsie...' (takes a drink, makes a face, shouts back at shop) You call this coffee? (dumps out coffee behind him, accidentally hitting a parked car's windshield) 

CAR

Hey! What the hell was that?! 

GEORGE

I'm sorry! I'm terribly sorry! I- I- 

CAR

Clean that up! 

GEORGE

Oh, sure. Of course. (looks for place to set down flowers) Um, uh, could you hold these? For just a second, just a second. (grabs newspapers from trash bin, begins wiping windshield) Here you go, now don't worry about a thing. It's gonna be fine. Here we go. Look at this shine. 

ENRIGHT

(sees George cleaning car windshield, looks appalled) 

GEORGE

Look at this sparkle. (looks up, sees Lindsay's mother) Mrs. Enright! (runs after her) Mrs. Enright! Mrs. Enright! 

GEORGE

(on phone, as Jerry gestures beside him) No, Lindsay, I had accidentally spilled coffee on the gentleman's windshield. Why would I do that? I have a job! Well, did she see a squeegee? Well, you're not going to make a dime without a squeegee. That's right, that's right, just tell your mother it was all a big misunderstanding. You won't regret it. Okay, I'll see you later. Buh-bye. (hangs up) 

JERRY

Strike two! 

GEORGE

You think I'm going down? 

JERRY

You're behind in the count. 

GEORGE

I know. 

KRAMER

(enters apartment, points at Jerry) Hey, what are you doing later? 

JERRY

I'm going out with Katya, thanks to you. 

KRAMER

Well, maybe you should try again. You know what happens the first time: people are a little shy, a little reticent. 

JERRY

If I do it again, that extends my payment book another two weeks. 

KRAMER

All right, where you going? 

JERRY

We're going to the circus. One of her old Olympic teammates is an acrobat. I don't even feel like going out. 

KRAMER

Well, Jerry, it's your obligation. C'mon. 

JERRY

Yeah, well, y'know what? If I gotta go, and spend time with this girl, then you're coming with me, Dr. Cyclops! 

KRAMER

No, no, no, I don't wanna go to the circus, Jerry. 

JERRY

Yeah, well you're going. 

KRAMER

Yeah, but I'm afraid of clowns! 

PITT

(in polo outfit, complete with jacket and high boots) I didn't send you over there to complain about the name. 

ELAINE

Well, I couldn't help it. 'Moland Spring'? 

PITT

I like the name 'Moland'. I picked it out. After all those months of negotiating! 

ELAINE

Well, I'm so sorry! I- 

PITT

Well, I'm going riding. I haven't been on Jenny for three days, all because of this blasted painting. (phone rings) Elaine? 

ELAINE

Oh, sorry. (picks up phone) Hello? 

PITT

(walks by 3-D poster, stops) Wait a minute! Wait a minute. Ah! 

KATYA

So, Jerry, you're enjoying the circus? 

JERRY

'Greatest Show on Earth'! 

KATYA

My father used to take me to the circus. When the elephants came by, he would scream curses at them, blaming them for all the ills of society. 

JERRY

Well, they certainly take up a lot of space. 

KATYA

Ah, Misha! 

MISHA

Katya! 

KATYA

Misha, this is Jerry. 

MISHA

Ah, yes. The 'co-me-dian', eh? (speaks in Romanian to Katya) 

KATYA

(laughs, replies in Romanian while pointing at Jerry) 

ELAINE

(on phone) Oh, yes, yes I'll tell him. Yes, thank you. Um, um hold on. (to Pitt) Mr. Pitt! 

PITT

(staring at 3-D poster) I think I'm on to something! 

ELAINE

Mr. Pitt! The board of directors is on the phone. They've called an emergency meeting. They want you to be there to discuss the merger! 

PITT

You said keep your eyes out of focus, which is misleading. You want DEEP focus! 

ELAINE

(on phone) Yes, hi. Okay, fine, yeah, hold on just a second. Lemme just... (reaches into purse) Yeah, I've got it... (pulls out both hands completely covered in black ink) Oh! Oh! Yeah, yeah, he'll be there. (drops phone, rushes to Pitt) Mr. Pitt, you have GOT to stop staring at that poster! 

PITT

I see something that could be a spaceship. Is it round? Is it pointy? 

ELAINE

(grabs poster, smashes it) No, you don't see it, and you're never going to see it! (grabs Pitt by the lapels, getting ink all over his jacket) Mr. Pitt, you have to meet with the shareholders, you have to leave now. Do you hear me? Do you hear me?! 

PITT

Hmm, what's happened to me? (straightens lapels) When's the meeting? 

ELAINE

In about twenty minutes. 

PITT

Oh! (puts finger to face, smearing ink on his upper lip which now resembles an 'Adolph Hitler'-style moustache) Do I have time to change? 

ELAINE

Um, no. 

PITT

Well, excuse me, I'd better get straight over there. 

ELAINE

Uh, Mr. Pitt... 

PITT

Yes? 

ELAINE

Um, there's a just... (points at her own upper lip) 

PITT

(sees Elaine's hands covered in ink) Is that ink? 

ELAINE

No? 

GEORGE

Well, here we are. 

LINDSAY

Do you want to come in? My mother's having a little party. 

GEORGE

Maybe I could just use the bathroom. 

LINDSAY

Sure. 

ANNOUNCER

(voiceover) Ladies and gentlemen, could I direct your attention to the center ring, where the incomparable Misha will balance ten stories above the circus floor on a wire no wider than a human thumb. 

MISHA

It is time. 

JERRY

Well, break a leg. 

JERRY

Eh, show biz... 

ANNOUNCER

Ladies and gentlemen, the incomparable Misha! 

JERRY

Boy, those capes are really coming back. 

GUEST

(exits bathroom, finds George waiting) Oh, sorry I took so long. They've got one of those 3-D art posters in there. (wipes eyes) It's mesmerizing. 

JERRY

What is that sound? 

KATYA

(covering ears) It is horrible! 

GEORGE

Whew! Anybody see that poster in there? That is weird, wild stuff, huh? Whew! 

PITT

I have been accused of wrong-doing. But these false accusations will not deter us. We WILL annex Poland by the Spring, at any cost! AND... our stock will rise HIGH! (raises hand) 

KATYA

He'll be all right. I must go and be with Misha now. I don't want you to come with me. 

JERRY

Oh, why not? 

KATYA

It has been three days since our night together. Misha said that was all the time I needed to put in. 

JERRY

Really? 

KATYA

In my country, they speak of a man so virile, so potent, that to spend a night with such a man is to enter a world of such sensual delights most women dare not dream of. This man is known as the 'Comedian'. You may tell jokes, Mr. Jerry Seinfeld, but you are no Comedian. (walks off) 

WAITRESS

O.K. Cowboys, (taps pencil on her pad) What'll you have? 

JERRY

I'll have the, ah, turkey club without the bacon. 

GEORGE

And ah, I'll have the bacon club without the turkey. (raises eyebrows) 

WAITRESS

George, don't make me get tough with you. 

GEORGE

Why, you think you can, beat me up? 

WAITRESS

You wouldn't want me to mess up the beautiful face of yours. 

GEORGE

Huh, nggh [snort] Stop. (flirting with her he playfully hits her arm with the menu, then flicks it into the air) 

WAITRESS

You don't want bacon I'll surprise you. (she turns and walks away) 

GEORGE

Wow, is she not terrific? 

JERRY

She does have a way. 

GEORGE

You think she thinks I have a beautiful face, or is she just saying that? 

JERRY

Well they do work on tips. 

GEORGE

'George, don't make me get tough with you.' Whu, hu, hu, hu huuuu (raises arms) Who says that? She is really cool. What do you think? You think she likes me? 

JERRY

Ah, I should have got the egg white omelet. 

GEORGE

Why should she like me? Who am I? Huh, there's a million people to like. 

JERRY

The omelet. Damn. 

GEORGE

Maybe she could like me? Is it that far fetched? Maybe she sees something? Is it possible? 

JERRY

No. 

GEORGE

No. 

JERRY

Not possible. 

GEORGE

Not possible. 

ELAINE

Heyyyyyy (leaning in, very friendly and happy) 

GEORGE

Hey Elaine. 

JERRY

Lannie, how was the trip? 

GEORGE

What trip? You were gone? 

ELAINE

I went to England ... with Mr. Pitt, for 5 days. 

GEORGE

Hunh, pph (raises hands slightly, in amazement) How was it? 

ELAINE

Actually it was great. I met an Englishman, and we really, hit it off. 

JERRY

Yeah, well that relationships really got a lot of potential. 

GEORGE

he he (laughs) 

ELAINE

Yeah well Jerome, I, happen to be flying him in on my frequent flyer miles. 

GEORGE

Flying him in? How long's he staying for? 

ELAINE

It's an open ended ticket. He can return any time he wants. 

GEORGE

All this in 5 days. Hmm. 

JERRY

Oh no, it's Kenny Bania. 

GEORGE

Who's he? 

JERRY

(quietly) Oh, he's this awful comedian. 

BANIA

Hey Jerry. 

JERRY

Hey Kenny. (with some fake enthusiasm, just to be polite) 

JERRY

Elaine, George (introducing them to Bania with less enthusiasm) 

ELAINE

Hi. (she flips her hair) 

GEORGE

Hi (raises his left hand in a slight gesture to say hi) 

BANIA

Hi. (to Elaine) 

JERRY

How's it going? 

BANIA

Great. I've been working out. Went from a size 40, to a 42. 

JERRY

No kidding. 

BANIA

Yeah, I'm huge (ducks his head into his right shoulder with false modesty) Well, I'll leave you guys alone. (raps his knuckle twice on the table, turns and walks away) 

JERRY

All right. 

ELAINE

O.K. Thanks. 

BANIA

Oh. Jerry, You know what just hit me? I was thinking -- What size suit are you? 

JERRY

Ahh, I'm a 40. Why? 

BANIA

I just got a brand new Armani suit -- doesn't fit me anymore. You want it? 

JERRY

Well I don't know if I ... 

BANIA

Oh come on. Why should it just sit in the closet? 

ELAINE

An Armani suit? 

GEORGE

Take the suit. 

JERRY

Well ... ok, I guess (voice trailing off) 

BANIA

You gonna be home later? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

BANIA

I'll drop it off. (raps his knuckle twice on the table again, turns and walks away) 

GEORGE

Heh heh heh hey, new suit (raises coffee cup as a salute / toast) 

JERRY

Yeah, yeah, lucky me. (sips coffee) 

WAITRESS

(to George) Here I personally made you a cold chicken sandwich. It's not even on the menu. 

GEORGE

(takes a large bite - with his mouth still full, his speech is muffled) Oh, this is fabulous. 

GEORGE

Boy, she is nice. I like her, I like her Jerry. She's got substance. She oozes substance. 

JERRY

Well, go in there and talk to her. She's not going to put 'em on the glass. 

GEORGE

You mean a walk back in? That's the toughest move in the business. You're sending me out into no-man's-land, and if I get shot down I have to crawl all the way back. Well I can't do it! I can't do it, I tell ya! 

JERRY

Pull yourself together. Your going in there soldier! That's an order! 

JERRY

Get in there. (he pushes George in the direction of the restaurant) 

KRAMER

Hey. (walking over to Jerry, who sits at the table reading the newspaper) 

JERRY

Hey. 

KRAMER

Listen, I need you to do me a favor. 

JERRY

What? 

KRAMER

Well, I need you to help me move my refrigerator. 

JERRY

Why? 

KRAMER

Cause I'm getting rid of it. 

JERRY

YEAH? (speaking loudly so the visitor can hear him through the intercom) 

BANIA

[It's K.B., I have the suit] 

JERRY

ALL RIGHT, COME ON UP (Jerry puts his head down - he's not looking forward to Kenny Bania) 

KRAMER

(claps hands) So ... 

JERRY

Well, well, why are you getting rid of your refrigerator? (he gets up from the table and carries a dish into the kitchen) 

KRAMER

Well after that Kidney Stone I only want fresh food. It's gotta be fresh. I'm not eating any more stored food. Plus you know I want the space. 

JERRY

What for? 

KRAMER

Well I could put a, dresser in there. I could get dressed while I'm making breakfast. 

BANIA

Hey (holds the Armani suit up) Here you go. (walks into the apt.) 

JERRY

Yeah. 

BANIA

You didn't think I was really going to give you a suit, did you? 

KRAMER

What, you're giving him this suit? 

BANIA

That's right, and it's an Armani. 

KRAMER

Armani? Hey, Armani Jerry. (Kramer takes the suit and looks it over) 

JERRY

Yes, yes, I heard. 

KRAMER

Come on, try it on. 

JERRY

No, it's ok. 

KRAMER

Come on, I want to see how it fits. 

JERRY

All right, all right. (trying on the suit jacket) 

KRAMER

There you go. 

JERRY

Ok, Yeah all right. 

KRAMER

Oh boy, that looks great. I can't believe you're giving him this. 

BANIA

I don't even want anything for it. 

KRAMER

He's very generous, isn't he? 

JERRY

Yes, yes, he is. 

BANIA

I'll tell you what -- you can take me out to dinner sometime. 

JERRY

Dinner? 

BANIA

Yeah. You buy me a meal -- you can't get a better deal than that (pats Jerry on the shoulder) 

KRAMER

No, you'll never get a better deal than that. 

BANIA

All right. I'll leave you alone. (turns and walks out the door) 

JERRY

Yeah, I'll see you. 

KRAMER

All right, ooh look at that Armani, huh, yeah. 

JERRY

Yeah, that's a deal. That's a terrible deal. I don't want to go out to dinner with him. I'd rather make my own suit. 

GEORGE

I did it! It's all done! 

JERRY

Hey. (raises hands into 'fists of encouragement') 

GEORGE

I did it. Hunh, we're going out as soon as she gets off of work and it'll still be daytime. You know I, I'm much better in the daytime then I am at night. it's less pressure. 

JERRY

I love the day date. No wine, No shower. 

GEORGE

There ya go. 

ELAINE

So the trip was good? 

SIMON

Yes (nice English accent) Apart from that, dreadful airline food. It tends to reek havoc with my stomach. 

ELAINE

You know I, I have to say, I've never admitted this to anyone, but um, I kind of like airline food. (leans in and laughs, flirting with him) 

SIMON

That's probably because of ... [muttering] 

ELAINE

What? 

SIMON

What? 

ELAINE

Yeah, what? 

SIMON

[sighs] 

ELAINE

What? 

SIMON

Where I come from, we don't say 'What?' It's proper to say 'Pardon?' 

ELAINE

Huh. (muttering) This should be interesting. 

SIMON

Pardon? 

ELAINE

Nothing. 

KELLY

So then about a year ago I started selling, these funky little hair clips. It's going pretty good. I make them in my apartment. 

KELLY

I'm just doing this waitress thing for a while, because I wanted to go to Europe this summer... 

GEORGE

(quietly) ahh. 

KELLY

...and I could use a few extra ... Careful 

GEORGE

Oh. It's just horse manure (huh huh - laughs, he points back at the horse that walked by) Horse manure's not that bad. I don't even mind the word 'manure.' You know, it's, it's 'nure,' which is good. and a 'ma' in front of it. MA-NURE. I mean when you consider the other choices, 'manure' is actually pretty refreshing. 

KELLY

That's a nice watch George. 

GEORGE

Yeah. 

KELLY

You know, my boyfriend has the same one. 

GEORGE

Huh. Really? 

KELLY

Yeah, he loves watches. He's a real watch freak. 

GEORGE

Well, how about that? 

KELLY

Ooh look out. (pointing at the ground - squishing sound) You stepped right in it. 

GEORGE

Yes, I sure did. 

JERRY

So you just pretended it didn't bother you? 

GEORGE

What is that, Boyfriend? I don't understand that. What, what does she think I asked her out for? 

JERRY

Boy, It's the way they just slip it in there too. 

GEORGE

Yeah, yeah, like it's just part of the conversation. 'Oh my boyfriend really likes watches. He's a real watch freak.' We-e-ell that's fabulous. (snaps fingers in the air a couple of times) 

JERRY

Well let me ask you this. What exactly did you say when you asked her out? 

GEORGE

I said, 'would you like to go for a walk or something.' 

JERRY

Oh, a walk, well -- 

GEORGE

Or something. I said, 'Or Something!' 

JERRY

Or something. Yeah, that's a date. 

GEORGE

(snaps fingers) There you go. 

JERRY

Course you know there is always the possibility, that she called an audible. 

GEORGE

What do you mean? 

JERRY

Well she got up to the line of scrimmage, didn't like the looks of the defense and changed the play. 

GEORGE

I think things were going ok. We were having a nice conversation. 

JERRY

Uh huh. 

GEORGE

I mentioned how I liked horse manure. 

JERRY

You did? 

GEORGE

Yeah. 

JERRY

Yeah. You said you liked horse manure. 

GEORGE

Yeah. 

JERRY

(quietly) Mm-hm. 

GEORGE

You know, about how when you break it down, it's really a very positive thing. you know, you have a 'nure,' with a 'ma' in front of it. MA-NURE. I'z not bad. 

JERRY

And it was around this point that she mentioned the boyfriend? 

GEORGE

Yeah. (Jerry nodding) ... Oh, you think because of what I said about the manure. I wa, wa, was just saying how it takes a negative thing, and puts it on a positive spin on it. 

JERRY

I'm just saying there's a chance she may not have been enamored with your thoughts and feelings on manure. 

GEORGE

So you don't think she really has a boyfriend? 

JERRY

My honest opinion, I think she made it up. 

GEORGE

Well then she's just a Liar, Isn't she? 

KRAMER

Hey. 

JERRY

Aaa. Well ... you want something to eat, don't you? 

KRAMER

Ahh, no, no, no. You got me all wrong buddy. I am loving this no refrigerator. You know what I discovered? I really like depriving myself of things. It's fun. Very monastic. 

GEORGE

Well what do you eat? 

KRAMER

It's all fresh. Fresh fish, fresh foul, fresh fruit. I buy it, I omniga nominga, I eat it. 

JERRY

Well I'm glad it's working out. 

KRAMER

Oh yeah, it's working out. And I got a date with that waitress who works at Reggie's. 

JERRY

Boy, if I could meet a hostess, we could open up our own place. 

KRAMER

Ha ha ha ha. Yeah, well, I'll tell you, she's a full-figured gal. 

JERRY

Is she? 

KRAMER

Oh you better believe it buddy. Hey George, we could double sometime. 

GEORGE

Yeah, yeah, yeah we could. You know, ah, Kramer, the next time you talk to her, find out if she knows Kelly, from Monk's. I wanna know if she really has a boyfriend. 

KRAMER

All right it's done. 

JERRY

Hello? 

BANIA

Hi, Jerry. It's Kenny. 

JERRY

Oh, Hi. 

BANIA

You know, I was thinking if you're not busy, maybe I can get my meal today? 

JERRY

Yeah, you wanna get that meal, don't you? 

BANIA

How about Mendy's, ooh, ever been there? 

JERRY

No I haven't? 

BANIA

Ah you're gonna love it. I'll meet you there around 7:00. 

JERRY

All right. 

BANIA

Ahh. 

JERRY

(hangs up the phone) Yeah, I really needed that suit. 

BANIA

I start off with curls. That's good for the bicep. (motions with 2 fingers along his right bicep) I do 10 reps, 2 sets. 

JERRY

Mm. That's fantastic. (he could care less) 

BANIA

You work out with weights? 

JERRY

No I don't. 

BANIA

You should. 

JERRY

Why? 

BANIA

You worn the suit yet? 

JERRY

No, not yet. 

WAITER

have you decided? 

BANIA

Oh, get the swordfish. Best swordfish in the city. The best, Jerry. 

JERRY

I'll have the salmon. 

WAITER

And you? 

BANIA

Ahh, you know what I think. I'm just going to have soup. Yeah, I'll save the meal for another time. 

JERRY

Another time? What other time? 

BANIA

I had a hot dog earlier. I'm not that hungry. 

JERRY

No, no, Bania, no. This is the dinner. The soup counts. 

BANIA

Soup's not a meal. You're supposed to buy me a meal. 

JERRY

I'm not stopping you from eating. Go ahead and eat. Get anything you want. 

BANIA

But I don't want anything but soup. 

JERRY

Then that's the meal. 

BANIA

But I had the hot dog. 

JERRY

I didn't tell you to have a hot dog. Who told you to have a hot dog? 

BANIA

Hey, I give you a brand-new Armani suit, and you won't even buy me a meal? 

JERRY

All right, fine. Get the soup! 

JERRY

So he just gets soup. He wants to save the meal. So now I got to do it all over again. 

ELAINE

What kind of soup did he get? 

JERRY

I don't know? Consomm&eacute; or something. 

ELAINE

Consomm&eacute;, hmm. 

JERRY

What? 

ELAINE

Well, that's not really a meal Jerry. I mean, if he had gotten, Chicken Gumbo, or Matzah Ball, even Mushroom Barley. Then I would agree with you. Those are very hardy soups. 

JERRY

Elaine you're missing the whole point. 

ELAINE

What? 

JERRY

The meal is the act of sitting down with him. It doesn't matter what you get, as long as he's sitting in that restaurant, its a meal. 

ELAINE

Was it a cup or a bowl? 

JERRY

You see -- ah, uh ... 

ELAINE

I'm just curious. 

JERRY

A bowl, ok? 

ELAINE

Did he crumble any crackers in it? 

ELAINE

(reiterating the question) Did he crumble, any crackers in it? 

JERRY

As a mater of fact, he did. 

ELAINE

Oh, well. Crackers in a bowl. That -- That could be a meal. 

JERRY

It's like I'm talking to my Aunt Sylvia here. 

ELAINE

Oh, hi Simon. This is Jerry. 

SIMON

Hello. (to Jerry, politely -- then quickly turns to Elaine) Elaine, do you have any cash on you? 

ELAINE

Um, yeah in my purse. 

SIMON

No. There was only six dollars. 

JERRY

Well, I have some money. What do you need? (pulls out some bills) 

SIMON

Well, 20 should cover me. (snatches the cash) Thanks mate. (he walks down the stairs to the sidewalk) 

ELAINE

Where you going? 

SIMON

(starts to turn back to Elaine) Just visiting. 

ELAINE

Oh, OK, see you later. 

SIMON

I won't be back for dinner. (turns and walks off down the street) 

ELAINE

(English accent) Pardon? 

JERRY

So is she working? Is she here? 

GEORGE

Yeah, yeah, she's here. 

JERRY

Have you said anything to her? 

GEORGE

No, but I'm very uncomfortable. 

JERRY

Are you going to say anything? 

GEORGE

There she is. (waiving his arms quickly above the table - to nix the conversation) No no no no no no. 

KELLY

Hello 

GEORGE

Hello. 

KELLY

Well, what's it going to be? 

GEORGE

What's it gonna be? 

KELLY

Yes. What'll you have? Are you eating? It's in that vein. 

GEORGE

I'll eh, I'll just have a bowl of chili. 

JERRY

I'll have an egg white omelet. 

GEORGE

What's it gonna be? ... You hear that? 

JERRY

Yeah, that was bad. 

GEORGE

Did you feel that tension? We use to have banter - (puts menu back with frustration) - there's no more banter. 

JERRY

Oh, no, it's Kenny. Slide out so he can't sit down. (George & Jerry each slide to the end of their booth seats) 

BANIA

Hey. 

JERRY

Hey. 

BANIA

You worn the suit yet? 

JERRY

Actually, I did. I put it on last night and slept in it. 

BANIA

You did? 

JERRY

... Oh, I'm joking. 

BANIA

OH! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Can I squeeze in? (to George) 

GEORGE

Sure you can. 

KELLY

Can I take your order? 

BANIA

What kind of soup do you have? 

JERRY

Why don't you get a sandwich? 

BANIA

Ok, I'll have tomato soup and ah, tuna on toast. 

JERRY

OK ... (nodding his head up and down) This is it 'cha know 

JERRY

This is the meal ... so stock up buddy boy. 

BANIA

What are you talking about? this isn't a meal. 

JERRY

Yes it is. Soup and sandwich. That is a meal. 

BANIA

You're supposed to buy me dinner in a nice restaurant, like Mendy's. 

JERRY

I tried to do that. 

BANIA

This is lunch in a coffee shop 

JERRY

Doesn't matter, This is it. This completes the transaction. 

BANIA

Ah, soup and a sandwich for a brand-new Armani suit. Is that any kind of gesture? (turns to George) 

BANIA

I'm really not comfortable ... 

KRAMER

(to George) Hey, I just spoke to ah, Hilde about your friend. 

GEORGE

Yeah. 

KRAMER

She doesn't have a boyfriend. She made it up. 

JERRY

Hi. 

ELAINE

Hi. 

JERRY

Where's Simon? 

ELAINE

Oh, he'll be right up. He's just getting some beer. And I'm not expecting ... any change. (leans forward as she brings her hands together in front of her, then sits on the couch) 

JERRY

When's he leaving? (putting some items into the refrigerator) 

ELAINE

About 2 days. Although he's hinting at how he'd like to stay. Fortunately he has no money, and no prospects. (she smiles) 

SIMON

Hey mate. Fancy a beer? 

JERRY

Ah, no thanks. 

JERRY

(on the phone) Hello? No, I'm sorry Bania ... I'm not going over this again. Well who told you to order soup? ... No! There's no dinner. There's not going to be any dinner. You've had a sandwich and 2 bowls of soup and that's it. Good-bye. 

JERRY

Hey, what size suit are you? 

SIMON

40. 

JERRY

40. Perfect. Brand-new Armani suit, you want it? 

SIMON

Absolutely. 

JERRY

Great, its yours. I can't stand the sight of it. Elaine, here's the car keys. (tosses her the keys) 

ELAINE

Thanks 

JERRY

Yo? 

BANIA

Listen Jerry, I've been doing some thinking. I want my suit back. 

JERRY

I don't have your suit. I gave it away. 

BANIA

Well it's my suit. 

JERRY

Well it's gone. I'm sorry. Good-bye Bania. 

KRAMER

Hey. 

JERRY

Hey. 

KRAMER

Um, yeah. (glances around the apt.) Oh, uh ... well, how's everything? (clap) 

JERRY

Ok. 

KRAMER

Good, ah, (clap) what's going on? 

JERRY

Nothing. 

KRAMER

Really. 

JERRY

You want food, don't cha? (nodding his head up and down) 

KRAMER

It's not for me. It's for Hilde -- the waitress I was telling you about. She's hungry, she wants food. If I go back in there without any food ... there's gonna be trouble. (his voice gets really high pitched on his last sentence) 

JERRY

All right, go ahead 

KRAMER

Thanks buddy. (goes over to the fridge and pulls out a few things) 

HILDE

Did you find anything! 

KRAMER

Uh, yeah, ah ... 

KRAMER

There's a few things in here, ah, peanut butter, cheese, yeah ... 

HILDE

Cheese is good. Yeah, what kind? 

KRAMER

Uh, Swiss. 

HILDE

All right, it'll have to do. Come on. 

JERRY

What are we doing out here? Aren't we going to go in and eat? 

GEORGE

I can't go in there. I'm too uncomfortable. 

JERRY

Oh, w-what are you saying? So we're not going to go in there anymore? 

ELAINE

Hey, What are you doing out here? 

JERRY

We can't eat here anymore, because he took a waitress out for a walk. 

GEORGE

What's the difference? Let's go to Reggie's. 

ELAINE

Reggie's? I can't eat anything there. 

GEORGE

It's the same menu. 

ELAINE

There's no 'Big Salad.' 

GEORGE

They'll make you a 'Big Salad.' What do you think, they're the only one's that make a 'Big Salad'? 

ELAINE

All right. Let's go, to Reggie's. 

JERRY

So what's going on with Simon? Did he leave? 

ELAINE

Ahh ... wait till you hear this. 

ELAINE

So Simon picks this woman up, right in front of me. 

JERRY

Look at this. They make a point of saying on the menu, 'No egg white omelets.' Look at that. 

GEORGE

So what! Have a yoke! It won't kill you. 

HILDE

(walks up to the table) Hello. 

JERRY

Oh, hi Hilde. Can I get an egg white omelet? 

HILDE

Did you read the menu? 

JERRY

All right, just give me a western. (unhappy) 

ELAINE

How 'bout a Big Salad? 

HILDE

A big salad? 

ELAINE

(to George) Ya see? 

GEORGE

Just tell her what'cha want, they'll make it for ya. 

ELAINE

It's a salad, only bigger, with lots of stuff in it. 

HILDE

I can bring you 2 small salads. 

ELAINE

Could you put it in a big bowl? 

HILDE

We don't have big bowls. 

ELAINE

All right. Just give me a cup of decaf. 

HILDE

We have Sanka. 

GEORGE

I mean, it's not fair. I've been going there for 7 years. She's been there 3 weeks. 

JERRY

Not fair. 

GEORGE

If anyone should be forced to leave that place, it should be her! 

JERRY

She's on your turf. 

GEORGE

If only she could get fired. Is there any way that could happen? I mean I know how to get myself fired. 

JERRY

You're the best. 

GEORGE

Well ...... but how do I get someone else fired? 

JERRY

Well as I see it, you've got to apply the same principles that get you fired, but redirected, outwardly. 

KRAMER

H-Hey. She's hungry Jerry. 

JERRY

Well, there's nothing left. There's no food. 

KRAMER

No food? Well you gotta have something -- (rummages through Jerry's cupboards and refrigerator) -- I can't go back in there with no food. She's expecting something Jerry. You don't know what she's like when that blood sugar drops. 

HILDE

(from Kramer's apartment) Food! 

KRAMER

There, you see. She's already in a bad mood. She just got fired. 

JERRY

Why'd she get fired? 

KRAMER

Oh, because I called over there a couple of times and the manager didn't like it. 

ELAINE

So, Simon is definitely going back now. He's meeting me here to return my keys. 

JERRY

Boy, he's a real bounder, isn't he? 

ELAINE

Yes. He's one of those bounders. 

KELLY

Egg white omelet and Big Salad. 

ELAINE

AHhh. Thank you. 

KELLY

I just wanted you guys know that Friday's my last day. Bloomingdales ordered a bunch of my clips, thank God, I don't have to do this any more. (turns and walks away) 

ELAINE

Ah (hu ha - small laugh) 

BANIA

Hey Jerry, where's my suit? 

JERRY

I don't have it. You want half my omelet? (holds his omelet plate up to Bania) 

MANAGER

(on the phone, we assume it's George calling) I told you, she's busy. She can't come to the phone now! (hangs up) 

MANAGER

You better tell your boyfriend to stop calling here. 

KELLY

Oh he's not my boyfriend. It's that bald guy with the glasses, who's always here with them. He's trying to get me in trouble. 

MANAGER

HEY! Yeah. I got a message for you. You tell your friend George, that the next time I see him around here, I'm going to turn him into my Own, Personal, Hand-Puppet. 

SIMON

Well, hello. Here you are as promised. You see, I'm a man of my word. (drops keys into Elaine's extended palm) 

ELAINE

When are you leaving? 

SIMON

Elaine, are you trying to get rid of me? Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha. I was supposed to leave tomorrow, but all of a sudden, I've been set up with a job interview that might enable me to extend my visit indefinitely. And it is all due, to this suit. How do I look? I'm a shoe-in aren't I. Thanks again love. (touches the table, turns and walks to the exit) 

ELAINE

(turns towards the lunch counter) Hey Kenny. You still want to get that suit back? 

BANIA

(leans backwards from the counter) Yeah! 

ELAINE

There it goes. (pointing at Simon walking out the door) 

BANIA

Hey! Hey! (he runs out the door after Simon; from outside) Come Here You! 

SIMON

(from outside Monk's) What are you doing? Unhand me! 

BANIA

(from outside Monk's) Take It Off! 

SALESMAN

George, are you sure I can't show you any other cars? 

GEORGE

I don't think so, Vic. I've done my homework. '89 Volvo, that's the car for me, it's the one I want. 

SALESMAN

I got a LeBaron convertible right here. 

GEORGE

N.I. Not interested. 

SALESMAN

It's got a few more miles on it, but the previous owner was John Voight. 

GEORGE

Jon Voight? 

JERRY

Okay, Tim. You're welcome. (Hangs up.) 

ELAINE

Was that Tim Whatley? 

JERRY

Yes, it was. He wanted your address - you, my friend, are going to be invited to his night-before-Thanksgiving party. (Elaine raises her hands triumphantly, then gleefully struts her way to the kitchen.) You know, he's got that great apartment on 77th street, and they overlook where they inflate all those huge balloons for the Macy's Thankgiving Day Parade? 

ELAINE

I have always had a big crush on Tim Whatley. Why can't he ask me out? (Punctuates this by shoving Jerry.) 

JERRY

Oh, he's a dentist. You don't want to go out with a dentist. 

ELAINE

Why? 

JERRY

He'll always be criticizing your brushing technique, it'll drive you crazy. (Mimics brushing his teeth) Away from the gums... (The door opens a little, George jangles the keys to his new car at Jerry and Elaine, then enters.) 

JERRY

Uh - new car! 

ELAINE

Ohhh! 

JERRY

Hey! Did you get the Volvo? 

GEORGE

No, I decided to go with an '89 LeBaron. 

ELAINE

A LeBaron? 

JERRY

I thought Consumer said Volvo was the car. 

GEORGE

What Consumer? I'm the consumer. 

JERRY

Alright. Seems like...a strange choice. 

GEORGE

Well, maybe so...but it was good enough for Mr. Jon Voight. 

ELAINE

Jon Voight? The actor? 

GEORGE

That's right. He just happened to be the previous owner of the vehicle. 

JERRY

You bought a car because it belonged to Jon Voight? 

GEORGE

No, no... 

JERRY

I think yes, yes. You like the idea of telling people you're driving Jon Voight's car. 

GEORGE

Alright, maybe I do. So what. 

ELAINE

I've never even seen him in a car. I mean, look at his movies. No cars. Deliverance - canoe. Midnight Cowboy - boots. Runaway Train...runaway train. (Kramer enters.) 

KRAMER

Hey. 

JERRY

Hey. 

KRAMER

Jerry, you know that shoe repair place at the end of the block? Well, if they don't get some business, they're gonna have to shut down and make way for one of those gourmet coffee or cookie stores. 

ELAINE

I like coffee. 

GEORGE

I like (imitates Kramer) 'cookies.' 

KRAMER

Yeah, of course you do. And do you know why? Because you're a bunch of yuppies. It's your go-go corporate takeover lifestyles that are driving out these Mom and Pop stores and destroying the fabric of this neighborhood. 

GEORGE

Well, what's so great about a Mom and Pop store? Let me tell you something. If my Mom and Pop ran a store, I wouldn't shop there. 

KRAMER

Hey, Bogambo - they've been in the neighborhood for 48 years. Now, come on, Jerry. You've gotta have a pair of shoes in need of a cobblin.' 

JERRY

I really don't wear the kind of shoes that have to be cobbled. 

KRAMER

Well, what about sneakers? You know, they'll clean 'em. They do complete detailing. 

JERRY

Alright, take 'em. 

KRAMER

Yeah-yah. 

POP

Kramer, without you, we'd be out of business. 

KRAMER

Well you know, these sneakers, they belong to my neighbor, Jerry Seinfeld? The comedian. 

MOM

So many sneakers! 

KRAMER

Well, he's got a Peter Pan complex. 

POP

They'll be ready a week from Thursday. 

KRAMER

Oh, well, no rush. (wipes his nose) Uh oh. 

MOM

What's the matter? 

KRAMER

Oh, I keep getting these nosebleeds. 

MOM

Oh, lie down, and put your head back. 

KRAMER

Yeah. (Lies on the couch and cracks the back of his head against the armrest.) Hey, what's with your ceiling? (Mom and Pop look up.) 

POP

What? 

KRAMER

Well, you got wires sticking out every which way. That looks dangerous, you should call the electrician. 

POP

You know, in the 48 years we've been here, I don't think we've ever called an electrician. 

KRAMER

Yeah well, you should. This place could blow any minute. 

PITT

Elaine? 

ELAINE

Yes, Mr. Pitt? 

PITT

Have you gotten all the salt off those pretzels yet? 

ELAINE

No, I'm still working on it. 

PITT

What in blazes are you listening to? 

ELAINE

Artie Shaw. 'Honeysuckle Jump.' (The song ends.) 

RADIO

That was Artie Shaw, 'Honeysuckle Jump.' 

PITT

Elaine! How did you know that? 

ELAINE

Oh, my father used have a huge collection of big band records. 

RADIO

Congratulations to our listener Wayne Hopper for identifying it. And by doing so, he becomes our seventh person to land the WFBB-sponsored Woody Woodpecker balloon in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. (Mr. Pitt hears this and is intrigued; mouths the words 'Woody Woodpecker.') There are only three spots left. We're going to take a little break now; when we come back, you'll have three more chances to win a spot holding a rope under Woody Woodpecker. 

PITT

Could you identify the next song? Could you? Could you? 

ELAINE

Mr. Pitt, why would you want to hold onto the ropes on the Woody Woodpecker balloon? 

PITT

My father was a stern man. He forbad us to participate in any activities that he thought were associated with the common man. The Thanksgiving Day Parade was first on the list. 

ELAINE

Oh. Alright, I'll do the best I can. (Turns up the radio.) 

RADIO

Alright, here we go for the next spot under the balloon. If you know the name of this song, call 555-BAND. (The music starts. Elaine listens intently.) 

PITT

Well, Elaine? Do you know it? What song is it? 

ELAINE

Will you shut up? I can't hear! 

PITT

I'm sorry! 

ELAINE

Oh! I've got it! It's 'Next Stop Pottersville'! (Grabs the phone to call it in.) 

PITT

Goody! Yes! Yes! Yes! (Dances back and forth, elated) Next Stop Pottersville, Next Stop Pottersville! You are a genius! 

GEORGE

You are gonna love this car. Even if you don't like Jon Voight. 

JERRY

I like Jon Voight. Just seems like kind've a strange reason to buy a car, because he might have driven it. 

GEORGE

What do you mean 'might'? You don't think he really owned this car? 

JERRY

I don't know. 

GEORGE

Well, why would the guy make up something like that? Of all the names he could pick, why settle on Jon Voight? 

JERRY

Don't you see, that's the genius of it. If he had said Liam Neeson, you'd know he's making it up. 

GEORGE

Neeson? How are you comparing Liam Neeson with Jon Voight? Jerry, we're talking about Joe Buck. If you can play Joe Buck, Oskar Schindler's a cake walk. (Opens the car door for Jerry, Jerry's about to get in.) 

JERRY

Oh, look at this, I stepped in gum. 

GEORGE

Whoa, whoa, you're not getting in my car with gummy shoes. 

JERRY

Alright, I'll change my shoes. (Heads back to his apartment. George follows.) 

GEORGE

Liam Neeson. You know, he's not American. 

JERRY

Let me get a clean pair. (Goes into his room. George strides over to the window.) 

GEORGE

Everybody's talkin' at me...I can't hear a word they're sayin'...just drivin' around in Jon Voight's car... 

JERRY

Kramer! (We hear Kramer's door slam open and shut. Kramer enters. Jerry comes out of his room.) Hey! Where's all my sneakers? 

KRAMER

You said take 'em. 

JERRY

Not all of 'em! 

KRAMER

Well, obviously there was a miscommunication. 

JERRY

Obviously. So what am I supposed to wear? 

KRAMER

Jerry, I left you a pair right here...(goes into Jerry's room and comes out with a pair of cowboy boots.) C'mon. There, put on those boots. 

JERRY

I can't wear these! 

KRAMER

Well, why not? 

JERRY

They're uncomfortable. 

KRAMER

C'mon here, try 'em on. (Jerry sits down and puts the boots on.) 

GEORGE

Where did you get those? 

JERRY

I worked a club in Dallas one time and they couldn't afford to pay me so they gave me these. Oh, I can't wear these! (Stands up.) They look ridiculous! 

KRAMER

Ah, you look like a cowboy! Huh? 

JERRY

But I don't wanna be a cowboy! 

KRAMER

Oh, stop it. You know that friend of yours, Tim the dentist? I got an invitation to his Thanksgiving Eve party. 

GEORGE

Yeah, I got one too. 

KRAMER

Yeah? 

JERRY

Oh yeah? Huh. 

GEORGE

What? 

JERRY

No, nothing. 

GEORGE

No, what is it? 

JERRY

No, it's just that I, uh...didn't get one. 

GEORGE

You didn't get one? 

JERRY

Ah, but he called me up and he asked for yours and Elaine's addresses, I'm sure that means I'm invited. 

KRAMER

Not necessarily. 

JERRY

Hey, why would you call someone up and ask them for two addresses if you're not invited to the party? 

GEORGE

That's the genius of it. 

JERRY

I'm callin' Elaine. See if she can find out anything from Tim Whatley. 

GEORGE

Hey. I got Jon Voight's LeBaron. (Jingles the keys.) 

KRAMER

Boss! 

POP

Four thousand dollars? We can't afford that! 

ELECTRICIAN

Well I'm afraid you're gonna have to do something about it, because it's in violation of the building code. Otherwise, they're gonna close you up. 

POP

But what if we can't pay for it? 

ELECTRICIAN

Then I have to report you. Otherwise, I lose my license. Sorry. (Exits.) 

POP

48 years, Mom! And now we have to close! All because of that idiot and his bloody nose! (Kramer enters.) 

KRAMER

Afternoon, Mom! Afternoon, Pop. You know you got a crack in the sidewalk out there? Now, you oughta get that fixed. 

GEORGE

So? 

JERRY

C'mon, put the top up, it's November! 

GEORGE

I feel alive, Jerry. 

JERRY

Let's check out the glove box. (Opens the glove compartment, takes out a pencil.) Ah. Pencil. 

GEORGE

Hey...you don't think...sure, that's Jon Voight's pencil! 

JERRY

With Jon Voight's teeth marks. (Looks at the owner's manual.) Owner's manual...you know what? This car was owned by Jon Voight. 

GEORGE

Ah! See? I told ya. 

JERRY

Except Jon is spelled with an H. J-O-H-N. 

GEORGE

So? 

JERRY

Doesn't Jon Voight spell his name J-O-N? 

GEORGE

So, what are you saying? 

JERRY

Nothing. I'm sure 'Jon' probably mispelled his own name. I know sometimes I spell Jerry with a G...and an I! (Laughs uproariously.) 

GEORGE

Get out of the car! 

JERRY

What? 

GEORGE

That's right, you heard me. Get out! You are ruining this whole experience for me! 

JERRY

Oh, look! There's Gregory Peck's bicycle! 

GEORGE

Get out! 

JERRY

And Barbara Mandrell's skateboard! 

GEORGE

Get out!! (Jerry gets out and George drives away. A couple of guys notice Jerry in his cowboy boots.) 

GUY

Hey, cowboy. Where's your horse? (Jerry slips and slides in his cowboy boots and runs away.) Yeah, you better run! 

GEORGE

Did they take anything? 

JERRY

No, they didn't even touch me. I tripped because of these stupid cowboy boots. 

GEORGE

Anyway, again, I'm sorry about throwing you out of the car. 

JERRY

You really seemed to enjoy it. 

GEORGE

It was kinda fun. (Elaine gives Jerry a cold cloth for his jaw.) You know, maybe his name really is J-O-H-N, but he changed it to J-O-N for show business. Well, you know, J-O-N is a lot zippier. 

JERRY

Yeah, that's possible. 

GEORGE

How would you find out something like that...wait a minute, what am I thinking? I've got the entire Yankee organization at my disposal. 

JERRY

He'll dispose of it. 

GEORGE

Heh, that's right. See ya later. (Exits.) 

ELAINE

So Jerome, I did a little snooping around for you. 

JERRY

Ah! What'd you find out, Lois? 

ELAINE

Well, I talked to Tim Whatley... 

JERRY

Yeah... 

ELAINE

And I asked him, 'Should Jerry bring anything?' 

JERRY

So...? 

ELAINE

Mmmm...and he said, 'Why would Jerry bring anything?' 

JERRY

Alright, but let me ask you this question. 

ELAINE

What? 

JERRY

Which word did he emphasize? Did he say, 'Why would Jerry bring anything?' or, 'Why would Jerry bring anything?' You emphasize 'Jerry' or 'bring.' 

ELAINE

I think he emphasized 'would.' 

JERRY

You know what? The hell with this party, I don't even want to go to begin with. (Kramer enters.) 

KRAMER

Hey. 

JERRY

Hey, so where's my sneakers? 

KRAMER

That's what I wanna know. 

JERRY

What do you mean? 

KRAMER

Well, I saw Mom and Pop this morning, but when I went by the store on my way home? The place was empty. Everything is gone. Mom and Pop - vrooop - vanished. 

JERRY

So all my sneakers are gone? 

KRAMER

I'm afraid so. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. I've been asking around - they didn't even have any kids. 

JERRY

Mom and Pop aren't even a Mom and Pop?! 

KRAMER

It was all an act, Jerry. They conned us, and they scored, big time. 

ELAINE

So. Mom and Pop's plan was to move into the neighborhood...establish trust...for 48 years. And then, run off with Jerry's sneakers. 

KRAMER

Apparently. 

ELAINE

Alright, that's enough of this. 

JERRY

Where ya goin'? 

ELAINE

I gotta go to the Dixieland Deli to pick up Mr. Pitt's security pass for the parade. 

JERRY

Why does he want to hold a rope underneath Woody Woodpecker in the Thanksgiving Day Parade? 

ELAINE

He finds his laugh 'intoxicating.' (Laughs like Woody Woodpecker, and exits.) 

MORGAN

So George, what kind of promotional events are we talking about? 

GEORGE

Well, I think we need more special days at the stadium, you know? Like, uh...Joe Pepitone Day. Or, uh...Jon Voight Day. 

MORGAN

Jon Voight? The actor? (Rubs his eyes wearily.) Uh, I make a motion that we have no more of these meetings that have been initiated by George Costanza. 

GEORGE

I suppose if I had suggested Liam Neeson Day, you'd all be patting me on the back. 

WINNER

I guessed Stan Herman's 'Boomtown Blues.' What'd you guess? 

ELAINE

Um, it was, uh...'Next Stop Pottersville.' (The group is unimpressed.) Uh, do you know when they're giving out the passes? 

WINNER

After the music. (The band starts playing directly behind Elaine. She is deafened by the loudness of the horns.) 

KRAMER

Oh. Oh man. (Takes out a Kleenex and puts his head back. Jon Voight comes out of a doorway and hails a cab.) 

VOIGHT

Taxi! (Walks right by Kramer.) Taxi. 

KRAMER

Hey! Jon Voight! Jon Voight! (Voight waves at Kramer and hurriedly gets in the cab. Kramer runs over to the car.) Hey, listen, can I ask you something? Listen, listen...(Leans in the the open back window of the cab. Defensively, Voight grabs Kramer's arm and bites it. Kramer screams. The cab speeds off leaving Kramer in the street, stunned.) 

JERRY

No Jon Voight Day, huh? 

GEORGE

No. Now I'll always have this doubt about the car. What, your jaw still hurts? 

JERRY

Yeah, it's all swollen. I think I may have chipped a tooth when I fell yesterday. 

GEORGE

You should have somebody take a look at that. 

JERRY

I'm calling dentists all day here, there's nobody working the day before Thanksgiving. 

GEORGE

You going to the party? 

JERRY

No, I don't know if I'm invited. 

GEORGE

Well, there's going to be a lot of dentists there. 

JERRY

Yeah, you're right. 

GEORGE

You don't want to suffer with this all weekend. 

JERRY

Yeah, I gotta see a dentist, this is killin' me. Well, I'll take a chance. We'll go together. 

GEORGE

Maybe I'll just meet you there. 

JERRY

You don't want to go with me? 

GEORGE

Jerry, for all I know this guy went out of his way to not invite you. How am I gonna feel if I show up with an uninvited, unwelcome intruder? 

JERRY

The way I feel when I go places with you? (Kramer enters.) Hey, so'd you find my sneakers yet? 

KRAMER

No. (To George) But I did run into somebody you might be interested in, a Mr. Jon Voight, the actor? 

GEORGE

Jon Voight! Are you kiddin' me? Did you talk to him? 

KRAMER

Well, he was a little standoffish. 

GEORGE

What, you didn't ask him about the car? 

KRAMER

No, I couldn't, his cab pulled away. But he did, however, make an impression on me. (Pulls up his sleeve and shows George his arm.) Look. 

JERRY

What? 

KRAMER

His tooth marks. He bit me. 

GEORGE

Jon Voight bit you? 

JERRY

Well, what is he, a vampire? 

KRAMER

No, it's justifiable. He thought I was going for his wallet. 

GEORGE

He left perfect imprints. 

KRAMER

That he did. Now, you got that pencil with the bite marks on it? We get a trained eye to match 'em up, and we'll see whether or not you're driving Jon Voight's car! 

JERRY

Oh, please. 

GEORGE

Wait a minute, wait, it's not that stupid. 

JERRY

No, it's stupid. 

GEORGE

Why? Why isn't it possible? I mean, they're both bite marks. 

JERRY

So you're gonna show up at that party with a chewed-up pencil and Kramer's gnarled arm. 

GEORGE

It's worth a shot. (Goes to the door.) 

JERRY

So, Kramer, you wanna go to the party together? 

KRAMER

Jerry, look, come on, I'm an invited guest. I can't be aiding and abetting some...party-crasher. 

JERRY

Excuse me, uh...dentist? You a dentist? (The guy shakes his head. Jerry moves on to another guy.) Dentist? Are you a dentist? 

GEORGE

These are the balloons? Big deal, all I see is Woody Woodpecker. 

KRAMER

You got a problem with Woody Woodpecker? 

GEORGE

Yeah, what is he? Some sort of an instigator? 

KRAMER

That's right. He's a troublemaker. 

JERRY

Hey, Elaine. Did you get my message? 

ELAINE

What? I can't hear a word you're saying. I was stuck at the Dixieland Deli all day. My head is still ringing. Where's Tim? 

JERRY

What is that, the Empire State Building? 

ELAINE

What? I can't hear you. 

JERRY

Elaine, would you marry me? 

ELAINE

I told you, I can't hear a word. 

JERRY

Alright. Forget it. 

GEORGE

Hey, Tim. 

TIM

Hey, George. Kramer, how ya doin.' (They shake hands.) 

GEORGE

Watch the arm! Tim, listen, we don't want to bother you, we know you're busy here. 

TIM

No, it's no problem, what is it? 

GEORGE

Let me show you something, take a look at this... (Another guy at the party interrupts.) 

GUY

Alright Tim, I'm gonna get goin.' 

TIM

Alright, let me take down your number. (Grabs George's pencil, then notices Jerry sitting on the couch.) Is that Jerry Seinfeld? 

KRAMER

He didn't come with us. (Tim walks over to Jerry.) 

GEORGE

Uh, Tim, the pencil... 

TIM

Jerry. 

JERRY

Hey, Tim. 

TIM

Jerry. I didn't think you'd show. 

JERRY

Did you say, 'Jerry, I didn't think you'd show' or, 'Jerry, I didn't think you'd show'? (Elaine comes over.) 

TIM

Elaine! Hi! 

ELAINE

Tim. 

TIM

Well. I'm really glad you came. 

ELAINE

What? 

TIM

Really glad you came. 

ELAINE

Uh huh. 

TIM

Listen, Elaine, I've been wanting to ask you...would you like to go out with me New Years Eve? (Elaine thinks Tim is offering her a nut, and shakes her head no. Tim, rejected, walks away.) Thanks. 

ELAINE

What? What? 

GEORGE

Let me ask you something. Could you tell if teeth marks on someone's arm matched teeth marks on a pencil? 

DENTIST

It's possible. 

GEORGE

Roll up your sleeve. 

DENTIST

Somebody bit you? 

KRAMER

Not just someone. Jon Voight. 

DENTIST

Jon Voight bit you? (George notices Tim across the room with the pencil in his mouth.) The pencil! Hey, hey! Get the pencil out of your mouth, you're destroying Jon Voight's teeth marks! 

TIM

That's John Voight's pencil? 

GEORGE

That's right. I got his whole car downstairs. 

TIM

Are you the one who bought his LeBaron convertible? 

GEORGE

Yes! Yes, I'm the one! Hey! So, you know Jon Voight! 

TIM

Yes! Yes, I went to dental school with him. 

GEORGE

Jon Voight, the actor? 

TIM

No. The periodontist. (George snaps the pencil in two.) 

DENTIST

Can't this wait until Monday? Come by my office. 

JERRY

Just a quick peek. I'm in agony. 

DENTIST

Alright. Sit down. 

JERRY

It's this one here in the back. (Tilts his head back, and knocks Elaine's trophy out the window. A loud hissing sound and commotion is heard from the street below. Everyone runs to the windows to look.) 

KRAMER

Oh! You popped Woody Woodpecker! 

TIM

Hey, who invited you, anyway? You're a troublemaker! (Jerry nervously laughs like Woody Woodpecker as the breeze from the popped balloon blows in the window.) 

TV

Hey, it looks like Woody Woodpecker is running out of air. In fact, he's collapsing. 

KRAMER

Those kids look pretty disappointed. 

JERRY

Especially that big kid up in the front. (Mr. Pitt is shown on the television, trying to hold up the deflating Woody balloon.) How old is he? (The phone rings.) Hello? 

PHONE

Hello, is this Jerry Seinfeld? 

JERRY

Yes it is. 

PHONE

You don't know me, but a really strange thing happened. I was at a garage sale, and this old couple sold me a used pair of sneakers they claimed belonged to Jerry Seinfeld, the comedian. 

JERRY

Can I have the address of that garage sale? Okay, thank you very much. (To Kramer) I found Mom and Pop, they're sellin' my sneakers! 

KRAMER

Where are they? 

JERRY

Parsippany, New Jersey. 

KRAMER

Let's go! 

JERRY

My car's in the shop. 

KRAMER

Well, how are we getting to Parsippany? 

KRAMER

Uh. Jerry. These nosebleeds are starting again. 

JERRY

Maybe we should get you to a hospital. 

KRAMER

Hey, I ain't goin' to no Bellevue! Look at me, I'm fallin' apart here. 

GEORGE

Well I am actually going to have a secretary and I get to do the interview. 

JERRY

That's incredible. Six months ago you were taking messages for your mother. 

GEORGE

Yeah, and now someone's going to be taking messages for me. 

JERRY

From your mother. 

JERRY

So this ah, woman you plan on hiring, is she going to be in the 'Spokes model' category? 

GEORGE

Sure. I could go the tomato route. But eh, I've given this a lot of thought Jerry. All that frustration. I'll never get any work done. So I'm doing a complete 360. I'm going for total efficiency and ability. 

JERRY

That's a 180, George. 

GEORGE

Whatever. 

JERRY

Hi Willie. 

WILLIE

Hey Jerry.&nbsp; 

JERRY

I got this stuff and ah my mother's fur coat for storage. 

WILLIE

What are you doing with it? 

JERRY

Ah, she keeps it in my apartment for when she comes up from Florida. 

DONNA

Hi. 

JERRY

Hi. 

WILLIE

Hey Jerry, you know my wife 'Donna'. 

JERRY

Yeah, that's why I said 'hi'. 

WILLIE

Hey, nice jacket. (looking over the jacket) 

JERRY

Thanks. It's Hounds-Tooth. 

WILLIE

Whoa, this is a beauty. Great cut. It's probably very flattering. 

JERRY

Oh yes, it really accentuates my bust line. 

APPLICANT

Well, I type about 90 words a minute. I'm completely well-versed in all IBM and Macintosh programs. 

GEORGE

(looking over her resume) Well Miss Coggins you're ah, obviously qualified for the job. You've all the necessary skills and experience. But you're extremely attractive. you're gorgeous. I'm looking at you, I can't even remember my name. So ah, I'm afraid this is not going to work out (he crumples her resume into a ball) Thanks for coming in. 

GEORGE

You're luscious. You're ravishing. I would give up red meat just to get a glimpse of you in a bra. I'm terribly sorry. (both George and the attractive female applicant stand up as George reaches across the desk and shakes her hand for coming in) 

ADE

As you can see my references are impeccable. I think I'd be a real asset here. My only concern is, I do take care of my mother. So will there be any late nights? 

GEORGE

I can't imagine. 

ELAINE

Ok, So Barney's is having this huge sale. I try this dress on -- (holds the garment bag out towards Jerry) -- Stunning. Stunning. I couldn't take my eyes off myself. 

JERRY

Yeah. 

ELAINE

OK, so then I put it on at home. It looks like I'm carrying twins. 

JERRY

So you're saying, Store -- Hotsy-Totsy, Home-- Hotsy-Notsy. 

ELAINE

Yeah exactly. Anyway I've got to go over there and return it. 

JERRY

I thought we were going to the movies? 

ELAINE

All right I'll try it on again. You tell me what you think. (she turns and goes into the bedroom to change clothes) 

GEORGE

Hey hey. 

ELAINE

Hey George 

GEORGE

Hey Elaine. (George hangs up his raincoat next to the door) I'm telling you Jerry, having a secretary is incredible. (George claps hands) I don't know why I didn't have one before. 

JERRY

Because you didn't have a job? 

GEORGE

Perhaps. (hehe) I walk in, everything is organized -- messages, appointments. And I can't tell you how proud I am of myself for going with Ade. 

JERRY

A lesser man would have crumbled. They would have gone for the 'dish' and the sure fire sexual-harassment suit. 

JERRY

It's a little ... 

ELAINE

All Right! (throws arms down) You answered it right there. 

JERRY

You got no waist in that thing. 

GEORGE

You arms look like something hanging in a kosher deli. 

ELAINE

I said, All Right. 

GEORGE

Well wha'd you buy it for? 

ELAINE

Why did I buy it, because in the mirror, at Barney's, I looked fabulous. This woman was just walking by said I looked like Demi (the 'i' sounds like an 'e') Moore in Indecent Proposal. 

JERRY

How fast was she walking? 

GEORGE

Demi (the 'i' sounds like an 'e')? I thought it was Demi? 

JERRY

No. I think it's Demi. (the 'i' sounds like an 'e') 

GEORGE

Really? I never heard of a semi (the 'i' sounds like an 'e') tractor-trailer. (Jerry nods in agreement) 

ELAINE

Wait a minute (claps hands) Wait a minute. I know what's going on here. Skinny Mirrors! (she pushes George and Jerry in their respective chests, with her arms extended -- one arm for each of them -- they recoil with surprise) 

JERRY

What? 

ELAINE

Skinny Mirrors! Barney's has Skinny Mirrors, they make you look, like, 10 pounds lighter. 

JERRY

Oh, you're crazy. 

ELAINE

Am I? (hands on hips) Do you think I would have bought this dress if I looked like this at Barney's? 

GEORGE

(to Jerry, as Jerry nods in agreement) You know I think she might have something there. 

KRAMER

Whoa. What are you all dressed up for? 

ELAINE

Oh I'm returning this dress to Barney's. 

KRAMER

Good idea. 

JERRY

Do it tomorrow. Well go to the movies. 

ELAINE

Yeah yeah, ok. 

KRAMER

Hey look, if you're going there, maybe you could pick me up some of this super hydrating, it's a total-protection moisturizer with Uva. 

ELAINE

Moisturizer? That's girls stuff. 

KRAMER

No no, look. I'll tell you what -- they're having a sale right. 

ELAINE

yeah. 

KRAMER

I'll meetcha down there, well have lunch. 

ELAINE

Well we could ... 

KRAMER

Well, we'll get to know each other. We never get to spend any time together. Oh sure we have our little group here, but ... (he looks and gestures out towards George and Jerry, as Elaine walks back into the bedroom to change out of the dress -- Kramer scratches his head in sort of disbelief) 

GEORGE

And then assuming the strike is resolved, on April 14th, we, ah, play the Angels. So let's clear a floor at the Anaheim Hotel. 

ADE

Anaheim Hotel. (George picks up a container of chinese food from the credenza) You may want to reconsider. I believe they only have room service until 10 P.M. and then it's only finger foods. 

GEORGE

Ade, you're a wonder. (he he -- george laughs) 

ADE

OK, now I projected some of those figures for you regarding the switch to Canola oil for the stadium popcorn and surprisingly it will only come to 1/2 a cent more per bag, so it is definitely doable. 

GEORGE

Ade, I have to tell you, I, I have never met anybody so ... efficient. 

ADE

Well thank you, I'm flattered. 

GEORGE

I mean you're just, you're just a marvel of organization. 

ADE

Well I'm just, hm, doing my job. 

GEORGE

It's like I'm thinking of something, and you're (snaps fingers) one step ahead of me. 

ADE

What can I say? I'm ... I'm good at what I do. (smiling and quietly laughing proudly) 

GEORGE

(coyly, he looks down and runs his finger along the top of the chair back in front of him) Do you, uh ... do you know what I'm ... thinking about now? 

ADE

(thinking about the question, she stops writing) Yes, I think I do. (she turns her head slowly and looks directly at him) 

GEORGE

Is it, uh, doable? 

ADE

It's definitely doable. 

JERRY

Well, that was the worst. 

ELAINE

I can't believe they made the Wife the killer. (putting on gloves) Gimme a break. 

MAN

(waiting in line for tickets, he overhears Elaine) Hey, give us a break. We haven't seen it yet. Thanks a lot big mouth! 

KRAMER

You got a pen? 

JERRY

Yeah, I think I do. 

KRAMER

And I need something to write on. 

JERRY

Well, all I got is my dry-cleaning stub. 

KRAMER

I gust met Uma Therman. She's giving me her telephone number. Uma Jerry, Uma. 

JERRY

Uma Therman? Really? 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

ELAINE

How'd you manage that. 

KRAMER

Yeah well I don't have any time to talk now. (he rushes back into the theater) 

JERRY

He's got the Kavorca. (looking towards the theater door, Jerry notices one of the movie goers) Hey, isn't that Willie, my dry-cleaner? 

ELAINE

Where? 

JERRY

He just went in. You know, I think he was wearing my Hounds-Tooth jacket. 

ELAINE

What would he be doing wearing your jacket? 

JERRY

It looked just like the jacket I brought in to be dry-cleaned. He complimented me on it. 

ELAINE

Are you sure? 

KRAMER

I got it. Uma, Uma, Uma. (looking at the ticket) 

ELAINE

You are amazing. 

KRAMER

Yeah, all right. Taxi's on me. (he walks off camera) 

ADE

Ah no no no no no. A better way to reach the bra would be to undo the jacket, then go around the back of the shirt. 

GEORGE

Ade you are incredible 

ADE

Oh ...oh ...oh ... Here, I want to show you something. Hand me that pillow. 

GEORGE

What? Oh, My God! 

ADE

Mr. CO STAN ZA! 

GEORGE

Ade, ahh, ahh, ah ... I'm giving you a raise! 

JERRY

So you're having sex and then all of a sudden, you just blurt out 'I'm giving you a raise.' 

GEORGE

Yeah. 

JERRY

Just a quick sidebar here -- are you in anyway authorized to give raises? 

GEORGE

Not that I'm aware of, no. 

JERRY

So you're so grateful to have sex, that you'll just shout out anything that comes into your head. 

GEORGE

I didn't think ahead. 

JERRY

Well maybe she'll just think it was bawdy talk. 

GEORGE

I didn't say any other bawdy things. 

JERRY

Maybe you could have sex with her again and then take it back. 

GEORGE

All right, you know you're not any help at all here. I don't know what even the point is of talking to you anymore. 

JERRY

All right, all right. I'm sorry. 

GEORGE

Yeah, well, I guess the only thing I can do is go into George Steinbrenner's office and tell him he has to give her a raise. 

JERRY

How long has she been there? 

GEORGE

3 days. 

JERRY

It's almost a week. 

JERRY

Oh, My god. 

GEORGE

What? 

JERRY

It's a movie stub from the 9:30 show. George, I think Willie the dry-cleaner has been wearing my clothes. 

ELAINE

These mirrors are skinny mirrors. This is false ... reflecting. And I think, that the department of ... you know, whatever, would be very interested to know what's going on here. 

ASSOCIATE

Well, we're more than happy to exchange it for something else. 

ELAINE

OK fine. (smiling) I did like that little Calvin Klein number right by the elevator. You know the little ... (motions in the direction of the elevator) 

ASSOCIATE

I'll bring it to your dressing room. 

ELAINE

Ok thanks so much. (the Barney's sales associate turns and walks away. Elaine turns to Kramer as he admires himself in the mirror) What are you all dressed up for? 

KRAMER

Well Elaine, when you're shopping on Madison Avenue, you don't want to skip on the, swank. 

ELAINE

I like your little bag. 

KRAMER

Huh, oh hey, look at this. (he pulls a little tube out of the bag) It's the super hydrating, triple-action moisturizer, hmm. 

ELAINE

Huh. 

KRAMER

Wait till that Uma smells this Uva. 

BANIA

Hey Kramer. 

KRAMER

Hey Bania, what's happening? (Kramer, looking into the mirror, is putting moisturizer under his eyes) 

BANIA

I'm looking for a new suit. I can't find anything I like. That's a nice suit. (admiring Kramer's suit) 

KRAMER

Well, thank you. 

BANIA

Did you get that here? 

KRAMER

No, this is vintage. They don't make this stuff anymore. 

BANIA

You're telling me. 

KRAMER

I sure am. 

BANIA

It's hard for me to find pants that -- 

KRAMER

(interrupting Bania) That don't make you look high-waisted. 

BANIA

Yes 

KRAMER

Me too. 

BANIA

What size are you? 

KRAMER

Uh, 42. 

BANIA

42, That's what I am now. I've been working out, I'm huge. How'd you like to sell it? 

KRAMER

make me an offer. 

BANIA

100 Bucks 

KRAMER

Surely you jest. (walks away from Bania) 

BANIA

175 

KRAMER

Look at the stitching (takes the jacket off to show Bania) This is old world craftsmanship. 

BANIA

300 dollars. 

KRAMER

Sold. Follow me into the dressing room. 

BANIA

You throw the shirt in? 

KRAMER

Bania, you're killing me. 

BANIA

Hey that's the women's dressing room. 

KRAMER

There's nothing in there that I haven't seen before. 

GEORGE

(Opens the door, looks in and then knocks 5 times) Mr. Steinbrenner, (waves) can I talk to you for a second? 

STEINBRENNER

Yes yes George. Can you talk to me for a second? Of course you can -- I'm a very accessible man. I just wanted to say you're doing great work on that Canola oil stuff. 

GEORGE

Well, you know, to be honest sir -- my, my new secretary Ade, came up with that one. 

STEINBRENNER

Ade, Ade, I like that name George. 

GEORGE

She supports her whole family. (walking slowly into the room) 

STEINBRENNER

Is that a fact George? 

GEORGE

Yes, In fact, her mother is in the hospital right now. It's some kind of a Diverticulitis. (he continues walking slowly towards Steinbrenner's desk) 

STEINBRENNER

I had a bout of that myself one time -- knocked me right on my ass. 

GEORGE

She can't even afford to go out to lunch. She's been eating in a high school cafeterias She pretends to be a teacher. It's pathetic. 

STEINBRENNER

What's that cost her, like, two and a quarter? ($2.25) 

GEORGE

You know what I was just thinking -- she could really use a raise. 

STEINBRENNER

You know, she'd be better off making a sandwich at home and bringing it in. (picks up the telephone hand set) Hello, ah, George will you excuse me. 

KRAMER

Psst. Hey. 

ELAINE

Kramer, what are you doing here? 

KRAMER

Listen, I need you to get me some clothes. 

ELAINE

What? 

KRAMER

Yeah, I just sold my suit to Bania for a cool three-hundred. 

ELAINE

So go buy a new one. 

KRAMER

What, at this place? It would destroy my whole profit margin. 

ELAINE

So. 

KRAMER

Listen do me a favor -- just call Jerry, tell him to bring me some clothes. 

ELAINE

Ouhhh (Kramer disappears back behind his wall as Elaine opens the dressing room door) 

JERRY

Hello, Willie. 

WILLIE

Hey, Jerry. You dropping off? 

JERRY

No, but ah, seen any good movies lately? 

WILLIE

You came by to ask that? 

JERRY

Yeah. Specifically 9:30 shows. Seen any good 9:30 shows at the Paragon, Willie? 

WILLIE

What are you gettin at? 

JERRY

I saw you the other night stepping out with my Hounds-Tooth jacket. 

WILLIE

Jerry that's a breach of the dry-cleaner's code. 

JERRY

You need a code to tell you not to wear peoples' clothes 

WILLIE

I wasn't wearing your jacket. Jerry you're imagining things. (he makes the circular motion next to his ears - the international symbol for 'insane') 

JERRY

Yeahhh, am I imagining this? (he whips out the movie stub and holds it up to Willie) Found this little cutie in the pocket. (throws the stub on the counter) 

WILLIE

Jerry. 

JERRY

Yeah, Yeah. Well, now that we understand each other -- I'll be taking my business elsewhere. And I want my mother's fur coat back too. 

WILLIE

Jerry, come on. 

JERRY

Now. 

WILLIE

Now? (Willie looks off with his eyes to his left -- he is thinking about his wife Donna) 

JERRY

Yeah. I want that coat. (Jerry opens his wallet, looking for the dry-cleaning ticket) 

WILLIE

Well ... ahh. (apprehensively) 

JERRY

Where's that ticket? Oh, Kramer. 

WILLIE

Wait, you, you mean to tell me you don't have a ticket for the coat? 

JERRY

No, not on me. 

WILLIE

Well, I, I need to see that ticket. 

JERRY

Why? I've got my cleaning before without a ticket. 

WILLIE

Yeah, but this is different. Those fur storage warehouses are huge. You can't, get anything without a number. 

JERRY

All right, I'll be back. 

ELAINE

Yeah it looks good here, but what does that mean? 

ASSOCIATE

So, uh, do you want it? 

ELAINE

I don't know, I have to think about it. (the sales associate walks away) I need a nonpartisan mirror. 

ADE

I can't thank you enough, Mr. Costanza. I'm so grateful 

GEORGE

Yes, well, I sat down with Mr. Steinbrenner. I told him you have been doing great work. I said that you deserved a raise, and if you didn't get it, that I, was leaving. (motions with both arms in a circular motion to his right) 

ADE

It was just so generous. 

GEORGE

Oh, well, don't worry about it -- he's got plenty of money. (spins his chair away from her) 

ADE

Oh I know, but Twenty Five Thousand. 

GEORGE

(spins his chair back to face her) So you got a $25,000 a year raise. 

ADE

Yes, I tell you, Mr. Steinbrenner... 

GEORGE

You're making more than I am. 

ADE

I am? 

GEORGE

What are you doing? You're making more than I am. A secretary cannot make more than her boss. 

ADE

Well apparently they can. 

ELAINE

Oh, this is insanity. I'm not this hippie. (meaning her hips are not that large) 

ELAINE

Hey, what do you think of this? 

MAN

(with disbelief): You'll never pull it off. 

CUSTOMER

Hey, what's going on in there? 

JERRY

(to the Barney's sales associate) Excuse me, could you tell me where I could find, like, women's moisturizer lotions? 

CUSTOMER

This woman has been in there for over an hour. 

ASSOCIATE

Excuse me Miss., Is everything ok in there? 

KRAMER

[Yeah] (through the door) 

JERRY

Kramer? 

KRAMER

Oh, Jerry, you got my clothes? 

JERRY

What clothes? 

KRAMER

Didn't Elaine call you? 

JERRY

No. 

KRAMER

Well what are you doing here? 

JERRY

What am I doing here? You're in the women's dressing room. I need that ticket stub back so I can get my mother's fur coat out. 

KRAMER

Oh, the stub, yeah. I left it in my, my pants 

JERRY

Where are your pants? 

KRAMER

Well, I sold them to Bania. 

JERRY

What? You sold your pants to Bania. Let me in. 

JERRY

Why'd you sell your pants to Bania? 

KRAMER

ouhhh -- I had Uma Therman's number written on that stub. I lost Uma's number. 

JERRY

Where are your clothes? 

KRAMER

I told you I sold them to Bania. 

JERRY

You mean what you were wearing? 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

JERRY

How'd you expect to get out of here? 

KRAMER

Well, I didn't think ahead. 

ELAINE

This isn't going to work for me ... so if you could show me something else. 

ASSOCIATE

No. 

ELAINE

No? 

ASSOCIATE

No, because you're taking that one. 

ELAINE

I am? 

ASSOCIATE

Yes. Because you wore it out of the store. 

ELAINE

Ha! That's preposterous. 

ASSOCIATE

I suppose that salt stain came from all the snow in the store. 

ASSOCIATE

Shall I wrap it or will you wear it out? 

ELAINE

No. You can wrap it. (Dejected. Elaine puts her head down and her hand to her forehead as she walks into the dressing room area) Kramer, are you still in there? 

JERRY

[Elaine] 

ELAINE

Jerry? 

BANIA

Elaine, where's Kramer? 

KRAMER

Bania? 

BANIA

Kramer. 

JERRY

I'm going out. (he comes out of the dressing room, while Kramer remains inside) 

BANIA

Jerry. 

JERRY

Bania. 

BANIA

Kramer, I want my money back for this suit. You're nancy-boy cream leaked all over the pockets -- Suits ruined. 

KRAMER

Well you're not getting any money back. (Kramer opens the door) Jerry, come back in here. 

JERRY

(to Bania) Excuse me. (he goes back in the dressing room) 

KRAMER

Uma's number is on that ticket. 

JERRY

Never mind Uma, I need that ticket to get my mother's fur coat back. Why don't you just give him the money for the suit? 

KRAMER

I'm not going to give him $300 now for a suit with moisturizer cream all over it. 

JERRY

I got an idea. 

KRAMER

What? 

JERRY

I can't believe I'm gonna do this. (Jerry opens the door and exits the dressing room. He walks over to Bania) 

JERRY

Bania can I talk to you for a second? How's everything going? 

BANIA

Pretty good. 

JERRY

Yeah, well, see the thing of it is, I'm in a bit of an awkward position here. Because, uhh, I don't want to get in between you two guys but ... I need a dry-cleaning ticket that's in the pocket of those pants. 

BANIA

Well all you gotta do is tell Kramer to give me my money back, and you'll get your ticket. 

JERRY

Yeah, yeah all right, well uh ... tell you what I will do Bania -- you give me the ticket, and uh, I will take you out for a nice dinner. 

BANIA

Can we go back to Mendy's? 

JERRY

You want to go to Mendy's, I'll take you to Mendy's. 

BANIA

Twice? I wanna go twice. 

JERRY

all right let's be reasonable, Bania. I'm taking you out for a nice dinner. All I want is a little ticket in that pocket. I think it's a pretty good deal. 

BANIA

Two Mendy's. 

JERRY

. . . All right (gritting teeth) Just give me the ticket. 

BANIA

Here you go. 

JERRY

Ohh ... (takes the ticket and heads for the dressing room) 

GEORGE

But Mr. Steinbrenner, how can I be expected to perform my job properly, knowing that my uh, subordinate is making more money than I am? With all due respect sir, it's outta whack. 

STEINBRENNER

Uh huh, I understand what you're saying George and I know what it's like to be financially strapped. When I was a young man in Cleveland I use to hitchhike to work. One time I got picked up by a bakery truck. You think that stuff smells good? Try being cooped up in the back of one of those babies. 

STEINBRENNER

I couldn't look at a donut for the next two years. Well not that I was ever one for the sweets. 

STEINBRENNER

Sure I like a cup cake every now and then, like everybody else. You know I like it when they have a little cream on the inside, it's a surprise. That's good, plus the chocolate ones are good too. Sometimes I just can't even make up my mind. A lot of times I'll mix the two together, make a vanilla fudge. 

JERRY

Let me in, it's me. (Kramer opens the door, Jerry goes in the dressing room) Here. You don't know what this is costing me. (hands Kramer the ticket) 

KRAMER

(closes the door) All right, nice work. (he looks at the ticket, flips it over, and then over again) Where's Uma's number? The moisturizer smudged out the phone number. 

JERRY

(Takes the ticket back and looks at it, flips it over) The dry-cleaning numbers are gone too. 

KRAMER

(grabs the ticket back and holds it up to the light) It must have been the botanical extracts. 

JERRY

(grabs the ticket back) Give me that. 

JERRY

Hey Bania, the dinners off. The ticket's no good. The numbers are all smudged out. (holds out the ticket and hands it to Bania) 

BANIA

(looking at the ticket then quickly looks up at Jerry) You trying to get out of Mendy's? you can't do that. 

JERRY

The ticket is worthless. 

BANIA

You promised me. 

JERRY

Hey, Isn't that my mother's fur coat? 

DONNA

No it's not. (the coat) 

JERRY

It is! (Jerry walks forcefully into the dressing room and closes the door) Give me that back. 

DONNA

No, what are you talking about. 

DONNA

Are you out of your mind? Don't you ... take your hands ... 

JERRY

You can't have that coat, it's not yours. 

JERRY

What do you think the dry-cleaner's is your own personal closet! 

ELAINE

Donna, do you think you can get the salt stain out of this? 

DONNA

Let me see. (Looking at the stain) Piece of cake. Bring it 

ELAINE

(Tilts her head down, looking over her glasses in amazement of 

BANIA

Mmm. This soup is great. 

JERRY

Yeah, it's very good. (reluctantly) 

BANIA

I told you Mendy's had the best pea soup. The best Jerry, the best. Are you enjoying it? 

JERRY

Yeah. I'm having a wonderful time. (it's obvious he isn't) 

BANIA

Wait till you try the swordfish. You know Jerry, I was thinking. For our next meal, do you think we should come here ... or should we go someplace else? You know it has it's pros and cons. On the one hand, here, you're guaranteed a great meal. On the other hand -- 

JERRY

(Interrupting Bania) Yeah, yeah I know. This would be good, but it would be the same. But if we go some place else, it would be different, but it might not be as good. It's a gamble. I get it. 

BANIA

Yeah. Well, let's hurry up and eat I gotta get out of here. I'm meeting a woman for a drink. 

JERRY

Oh, and who might that be? 

BANIA

Some woman named Uma. I got her number off of that ticket before it was smudged. Hope she's good-looking. (crosses his fingers in the air) 

JERRY

If you are a waitress and you ever see me in a restaurant, I'm telling you right now, I don't want to hear about the specials. I don't want to know about the specials. I'm sick of the specials. I hate the specials. My feeling is, if the specials were so special, they'd be on the menu. You know what's special about them? They don't know if anybody likes them. They always have these overly creative descriptions of the specials too, you know. The veil is lightly slapped, and then sequestered in a one-bedroom suite with a white wine intravenous. 

JERRY

Ready to go Lois? 

LOIS

You really like to say my name? Don't you? 

JERRY

Excuse me Lois. Stand back Lois. Jimmy's in trouble Lois. 

LOIS

Oh, Mr. Meyers this is my friend, Jerry. 

DUNCAN

Jerry Seinfeld! 

JERRY

Duncan Meyers! 

LOIS

You two know each other? 

DUNCAN

Yeah! We uh, went to High School together. Didn't we Jerry? Gee I hope you're not leaving now. We still have a lot of work left to do. 

LOIS

Would you be able to come all the way downtown again in rush hour to pick me up? 

JERRY

Well, I'd have to be Superman to do that Lois. 

ELAINE

No, no This is all wrong. Where's the Chicken Cashew? 

LEW

You no order Chicken Cashew. 

ELAINE

I didn't order any of this. I'm not paying for this. 

LEW

Fine Benes. We are putting you on our list. 

ELAINE

What list? 

LEW

The 'do not deliver' list. 

ELAINE

MERRY CHRISTMAS TO YOU! Well, I guess we'll just go out. 

GEORGE

Yeah. What are you doing with the Daily Worker? 

ELAINE

Ned must have left it here. 

GEORGE

Your boyfriend reads the Daily Worker? What is he? A communist? 

ELAINE

HE reads everything, you know, Ned's very well read. 

GEORGE

Maybe he's just 'very well RED'? 

ELAINE

Communist? Don't you think he probably would have told me? 

GEORGE

Well, does he wear bland, drab, olive colored clothing? 

ELAINE

Yes, . . . yes he does dress a little drab. 

GEORGE

Huh, he's a communist. . . . Look at this. 'Exciting uninhibited woman seeks forward thinking comrade and appearance not important.' . . . Appearance Not Important! This is unbelievable. Finally this is an ideology I can embrace. 

JERRY

Hi oh. 

GEORGE

Hey. 

ELAINE

Where's Lois? 

JERRY

She couldn't make it. 

GEORGE

I can't believe you're really going out with a woman named Lois. 

JERRY

I know, finally. But George, guess who her boss is. Duncan Meyers. 

GEORGE

Duncan Meyers? 

ELAINE

Who's he? 

JERRY

Elaine, only one other person in the world knows what I am about to tell you and that's George. When we were in the ninth grade they had us all line up at one end of the school yard for this big race to see who was going to represent the school in this track meet. 

ELAINE

Uh uh 

JERRY

I was the last one on the end. George was next to me. And Mr. Bevilacqua, the gym . . . 

ELAINE

What's that? 

JERRY

Mr. Bevilacqua, the gym teacher. 

ELAINE

Oh, of course. 

JERRY

He was down at the other end. So he yells out, 'Ready, On your mark, Get set, ' and I was so keyed up I just took off. By the time he said go I was ten yards ahead of everybody. 

ELAINE

No. 

GEORGE

I looked up. I couldn't believe it. 

JERRY

By the time the race was over I had won. I was shocked nobody had noticed the head start. 

ELAINE

Really? 

JERRY

And I had won by so much a myth began to grow about my speed. Only Duncan suspected something was a miss. He's hated me ever since. Now he's back. 

ELAINE

Well what happened when you raced him again? 

JERRY

I never did. In four years of high school I would never race anyone again. Not even to the end of the block to catch a bus. And so the legend grew. Everyone wanted me to race. They begged me. The track coach called my parents. Pleading. Telling them it was a sin to waste my god given talent. But I answered him in the same way I answered everyone. I chose not to run. 

ELAINE

So now Duncan is back? 

JERRY

He's back. And I knew he would be someday. (drinks) Man that's some tart cider! 

JERRY

Hi. 

LOIS

Sorry I missed the Chinese food. 

JERRY

Oh, so am I . Uh, how's Duncan? 

LOIS

He's okay. 

JERRY

He say anything? 

LOIS

About what? 

JERRY

Oh, nothing in particular. 

LOIS

. . . Why did you cheat in that race? 

JERRY

I did not cheat. 

LOIS

He said that you got a head start. 

JERRY

Oh, he's just jealous because he came in second. 

LOIS

Really? 

JERRY

Yes 

LOIS

So you WERE the fastest kid in school. 

JERRY

Faster than a speeding bullet Lois. 

ELAINE

So how was work? Another day, another dollar? 

NED

I guess. 

ELAINE

Oh well nothing wrong with that. Gotta make those big bucks. . . . money money money money money money money . . . ha ha ha ha ah . . . are you a communist? 

NED

Yes, as a matter of fact I am. 

ELAINE

OH, AH! OH! WOW! WHOA! A COMMIE! Wow, gee, man it must be a bummer for you guys what with the fall of the soviet empire and everything . 

NED

Yeah, well, we still got China, and Cuba, 

ELAINE

Yeah, but come on . . . 

NED

I know it's not the same. 

ELAINE

Well, you had a good run, what was it 75, 80 years? Wreaking havoc, making everybody nervous. 

NED

Yeah, we had a good run. 

ELAINE

Well, so enjoy yourself. (clink glasses) ha ha uh ha 

GEORGE

So you lied to her? 

JERRY

I couldn't tell her the truth. I don't know what's going to happen between us. What if we have a bad breakup. She'll go straight to Duncan. And I want him to go to his grave never being certain I got that 

ELAINE

Well, I'm dating a communist. 

JERRY

Wow, a communist. That's something. 

ELAINE

Yeah, that's pretty cool isn't it? 

GEORGE

Hey, did I tell you I called one of those girls from the personal ads in The Daily Worker? 

JERRY

The Daily Worker has personal ads? 

GEORGE

And they say appearance is not important. 

JERRY

Yours or hers? 

KRAMER

Ho Ho Ho Ho Ho Merry Christmas everyone. Merry Christmas. 

JERRY

Wow, look at you. So you got the job. 

KRAMER

Yeah, you're looking at the new Santa at Coleman's Department store. 

ELAINE

Oh, congratulations 

MICKEY

Come on get your bead on. We're going to be late. 

KRAMER

On Prancer on Dasher, on Donna. 

MICKEY

Not Donna, it's Donner. 

KRAMER

Donna! 

MICKEY

Yeah, right!. On Prancer, on Dancer, on Donna, on Ethyl, on Harriet. 

JERRY

Hello, Oh hi Lois, you want to get together, what for? I don't know about that, I'll have to think about it. I'll let you know. Okay, bye. 

GEORGE

What's up? 

JERRY

Duncan wants to get together with her and me for lunch tomorrow. He obviously wants me to admit I got a head start. And I don't think she believes me. 

GEORGE

He wants to meet you? I'll tell you what. I'll show up. He doesn't know we're friends. I'll pretend I haven't seen you since High School. I'll back up the story. 

JERRY

That's not bad. 

GEORGE

Not bad? It's gorgeous! 

KRAMER

Ho ho ho Well come on little Princess, tell Santa what you want. Don't be shy. 

MOM

She doesn't speak English (with a Swedish accent). 

KRAMER

Santa speaks the language of all children. A notchie watchie dotchie do. 

KRAMER

A dotchie cotchie dochie, 

KRAMER

Het, Mickey when do we get a break? My lap is killing me. 

MICKEY

There is no break. 

KRAMER

A sweat shop. 

KRAMER

Hey, hey, hey. 

ADA

Natalie on line 2. 

GEORGE

Natalie? 

ADA

From the Daily Worker. 

GEORGE

Thank you. 

GEORGE

Hello, it's Natalie? Yeah, this is a business office but I'm not a business man per se. I'm here working for the people. Yes, I'm causing dissent. Stirring the pot. Getting people to question the whole rotten system. 

ILENE

Elaine. 

ELAINE

Ilene. 

ILENE

Hi. 

ELAINE

Hello. 

ILENE

Doing a little Christmas shopping? 

ELAINE

Yeah, yeah. Oh, this is Ned. He's a communist. 

ILENE

Oh, really? 

ELAINE

Yep . . . a big communist, a big big communist. 

ILENE

Oh, well, it's awfully nice to see you. See you later. 

ELAINE

Bye bye 

ELAINE

Hey, listen while we're here why don't we do a little shirt shopping? 

NED

Out of the question. 

ELAINE

Um. Kramer! 

KRAMER

Hi 

ELAINE

Hi, oh hi Mickey, this is Ned 

KRAMER

Oh, hey, hi buddy. 

ELAINE

You guys stay here, I'll be right back. 

KRAMER

Eight hours of jingle belling and ho ho hoing. Boy, I am ho'd out. 

NED

Anyone who works here is a sap. 

MICKEY

Watch it! 

KRAMER

Woah, woah, come on. 

NED

You understand the Santa's at Bloomfields are making double what you are? 

KRAMER

Double? 

NED

I bet the beard itches doesn't it? 

KRAMER

You got that straight. 

NED

So when you get a rash all over your face in January do you think Coleman's will be there with a medical plan? 

MICKEY

Look, you take that commie crap out into the street. 

NED

Kramer, I've got some literature in my car that will change your whole way of thinking. 

KRAMER

Talk to me baby. 

MICKEY

Don't listen to him Kramer, you've got a good job here. 

DUNCAN

But there's no way you could have beaten me by that much. I already beaten you in Junior High School three times. 

JERRY

I didn't hit puberty til the 9th grade. That's what gave me my speed. Besides, if I got a head start why didn't Mr. Bevilacqua stop the race? 

DUNCAN

That's what I've always wondered about. 

JERRY

Well, I . . . [sees George] 

GEORGE

Oh, my God, No, oh my God, . . . Jerry! 

JERRY

I'm sorry, uh, 

GEORGE

George, George Costanza! 

JERRY

Oh, George Costanza , Kennedy High. 

GEORGE

Yes yes yes This is unbelievable. 

DUNCAN

Hi, George 

GEORGE

Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute, don't tell me, don't tell me. It starts with a . . . Duncan Meyers. Oh, wow, this is something. I haven't seen you guys in what, twenty years? 

JERRY

This is Lois. 

LOIS

Hello. 

GEORGE

So what have you been doing with yourself? 

JERRY

I'm I'm a comedian. 

GEORGE

Ah ha, well, I really wouldn't know about that. I don't watch much TV. I like to read. So what do you do, a lot of that 'did you ever notice?' this kind of stuff. 

JERRY

Yeah, yeah 

GEORGE

It strikes me a lot of guys are doing that kind of humor now. 

JERRY

Yeah, yeah, Well, you really got bald there, didn't you? 

GEORGE

Yeah, yeah. 

JERRY

You really used to have a think full head of hair. 

GEORGE

Yeah, yeah. Well, I guess I started losing it when I was about twenty-eight right around the time I made my first million. You know what they say. The first million is the hardest one. 

JERRY

yeah, yeah. 

LOIS

What do you do? 

GEORGE

I'm an architect. 

LOIS

Have you designed any buildings in New York? 

GEORGE

Have you seen the new addition to the Guggenheim? 

LOIS

You did that? 

GEORGE

Yep. And it didn't take very long either. 

JERRY

Well you've really built yourself up into something. 

GEORGE

Well, well, I had a dream, Jerry. 

JERRY

Well, one cannot help[ but wonder what brings you into a crummy little coffee shop like this. 

GEORGE

Well, I like to stay in touch with the people. 

JERRY

Ah, you know you have a hole in your sneaker there. What is that canvas? 

GEORGE

You know my driver's waiting, I really should get running. Good to see you guys again. 

JERRY

George, George, hang on. I haven't seen you in so long. 

GEORGE

Ha, uh, 

JERRY

I thought we might reminisce a little more. You know Duncan and I were just taking about the big race. 

GEORGE

Oh, the big race. 

JERRY

Yeah. 

GEORGE

Yes, yes,. 

LOIS

You were there? 

GEORGE

Yes, sure, surely was. Yeah, I'll remember that day. Well I'll never forget it because that was the day that I uh, lost my virginity to Miss. Stafford, the uh, voluptuous home room teacher. 

DUNCAN

Miss Stafford? 

GEORGE

Yes, yes, you know I was in detention and she came up behind me while I was erasing the blackboard . . . 

JERRY

George! 

GEORGE

But I digress. Let me see, now. You were standing at one end of the line and I was right next to you. And I remember we were even for like, the first five yards and then , BOOM,...You were gone. 

JERRY

Did I get a head start? 

GEORGE

Head start, oh no absolutely not. 

JERRY

You satisfied? So you see? 

DUNCAN

No, I'm still not convinced and I never will be. 

DUNCAN

That's a good idea. 

JERRY

No, no, no, another race - out of the question. 

DUNCAN

I know, you've been saying that for twenty years because you know you can't beat me. You couldn't beat me then and you can't beat me now. 

LOIS

Race him Jerry. Race him. 

JERRY

All right! I'll do it. The race is on. 

ELAINE

. . . shut up! (?) 

JERRY

And he's calling all these people from High School to come and watch. I knew this day would come. I can't do it. I can't go through with it. I'm calling it off. I can't let the legend die. It's like a kid finding out there's no Santa Claus 

KRAMER

Each according to his ability, to each according to his needs. 

MICKEY

What does that mean? 

KRAMER

Well, if you've got needs and abilities that's a pretty good combination. 

MICKEY

So what if I want to open up a delicatessen? 

KRAMER

There are no delicatessens under Communism. 

MICKEY

Why not? 

KRAMER

Well, because the meats are divided into a class system. You got Pastrami and Corned Beef in one class and Salami and Bologna in another. That's not right. 

MICKEY

So you can't get Corned Beef? 

KRAMER

Well, you know, if you're in the Politburo, maybe. 

GEORGE

(on phone) . It's George Costanza. . are there any messages for me? Why does Mr. Steinbrenner want to see me in his office? . . . Communist? I'm not a Communist . . . . All right, all right. All right, I'll be there. - ( hangs up ) My secretary Ada, told Mr Steinbrenner I'm a Communist Now he wants to see me in his office. 

JERRY

So you'll just explain to him you're not a Communist. You just called the woman for a date. 

JERRY

Hello, oh hi Duncan, 4:00 o'clock tomorrow? That is not going to work. . . . Why? I'll tell you why. Because I chose not to run! 

NED

I'm sorry Elaine. The shirt's too fancy. 

ELAINE

Just because you're a communist, does that mean you can't wear anything nice? You look like Trotsky. It's gorgeous. Fine, you want to be a Communist, be a Communist. Can't you at least look like a successful Communist? 

NED

All right, I'll try it on. 

ELAINE

I'm going to order Chinese Food. 

NED

You're ordering from Hop Sing's, right? 

ELAINE

Ugh, does it have to be Hop Sing's. I kind of had a fight with him. 

NED

Elaine, when my father was black listed he couldn't work for years. He and his friends used to sit at Hop Sing's every day figuring out how to survive. 

ELAINE

You're father was blacklisted? 

NED

Yes he was, and you know why? Because he was betrayed by people he trusted. They 'named names'. 

ELAINE

Okay, okay. (phones) Um, yeah, hi, I'd like delivery please to 16 West 75th St. apartment 2G. 

LEW

I know that address. You're Benes, right. You're on our list. No more delivery. 

ELAINE

No. no, she doesn't live here anymore. This is someone else. 

LEW

Oh, yeah. What's the name? 

ELAINE

Why do you need the name? You already have the address. 

LEW

We need a name. Give us a name. 

ELAINE

Okay, okay, Ned Isakoff. 

KID

I want a racing car set. 

KRAMER

Ho ho ho ho A racing car set! Those are assembled in Tai Wan by kids like you. And these Coleman pigs, they sell it at triple the cost. 

KID

But I want a racing car set. 

KRAMER

You see kid, you're being bamboozaled. These capatalist fat cats are inflating the profit margin and reducing your total number of toys. 

KID

Hey, this guy's a COMMIE! 

MICKEY

Hey, kid, quiet. Were did a nice little boy like you learn such a bad word like that? Huh? 

KID

Commie, Commie, Commie . . . (unknown) . 

MICKEY

Santa is not a Commie. He just forgot how his good friend stuck his neck out for him to get him a good job like this. Didn't he Santa! 

MANAGER

Is there a problem here? 

KRAMER

ho ho ho ho. 

KID

This guy's a Commie. He's spreading propoganda. 

MANAGER

Oh yeah? Well that's enough pinko! You're through. The both of ya' 

MICKEY

I got two kids in college. 

KRAMER

You can't fire me, I'm Santa Claus. 

MANAGER

Not anymore. Get your skinny ass out of here. 

JERRY

Hi how are you? 

LOIS

. . . Fine. 

JERRY

What's the matter? 

LOIS

I just spoke to Duncan. He said if you don't race, he's going to fire me. 

JERRY

What? He can't do that. 

LOIS

Yes he can. He controls the means of production. What are you going to do Jerry? 

JERRY

Don't worry Lois. I'll think of something. 

LEW

Ah, I knew it was you! You tried to trick Hop Sing! You are onour list; Elaine Benes! And now you are on our list; Ned Isakoff. 

NED

You got me blacklisted from Hop Sing's? 

LEW

She named name! 

GEORGE

You, uh, wanted to see me, Mr. Steinbrenner? 

STEINBRENNER

Yes George, I did. Come in, come in. George, the wordaround the office is that you're a Communist. 

GEORGE

C-Communist? I am a Yankee, sir, first and foremost. 

STEINBRENNER

You know George, it struck me today me that a Communistpipeline into the vast reservoir of Cuban baseball talent could be thegreatest thing ever to happen to this organization. 

GEORGE

Sir? 

STEINBRENNER

You could be invaluable to this franchise. George, there's a southpaw down there nobody's been able to get a look at; something Rodriguez, I don't really know his name. You get yourselfdown to Havana right away. 

GEORGE

Yes, sir. Yes sir, do my best. 

STEINBRENNER

Good, Merry Christmas George. And bring me back some of those cigars in the cedar boxes, you know the ones with the fancy rings? I love those fancy rings. They kind of distract you while you're smoking. The red and yellow are nice. It looks good against the brown of the cigar. The Maduro, I like the Maduro wrapper. The darker the better, that's what I say. Of course, the Claro's good too. That's more of a pale brown, almost like a milky coffee. (George exits) I find the ring size very confusing. They have it in centimeters which I don't really understand that well... 

MICKEY

That was quick! Nice job, Santa! 

KRAMER

Yeah, 

MICKEY

I knew that Commie stuff was going to get us in trouble. 

KRAMER

Yeah, well I didn't realize that was such a sensitive issue. 

MICKEY

Communism, You didn't realize Communism was a sensitive issue? What do you think has been going on in the world for the past 60 years? Wake up and smell the coffee. 

KRAMER

I guess I screwed up! 

MICKEY

You sure did. Big time. 

ELAINE

How do you feel? 

JERRY

I need a miracle. 

DUNCAN

Now you're going to see what kind of liar you're mixed up with. 

LOIS

If he beats you I want a big raise. 

DUNCAN

If he beats me, I'll not only give you a raise, I'll send you to Hawaii for two weeks. 

KRAMER

I parked in front of that restaurant . As soon as this race is over I got to go to the airport. 

GEORGE

Okay, all right, all right. 

BEVILACQUA

You ready boys? 

JERRY

Yes, Mr. Beviacqua 

BEVILACQUA

Okay, this is hoiw it works. You take your marks, I say, READY - ON YOUR MARK - GET SET - and then fire. You got it? 

JERRY

Yes Mr. Bevilacqua. 

BEVILACQUA

READY - ON YOUR MARK 

JERRY

Maybe I will , Lois. Maybe I will. 

GEORGE

You wanted to see me, El Presidente? 

CASTRO

Si, si. (a Spanish word I can't figure out) Come here. I understand you are very interested in one of our players, eh? 

GEORGE

Si, si. 

CASTRO

Ordinarily I would not grant such a request but I've heard you are, uh, how you say, Communista simpatico, eh? 

GEORGE

Muy sumpatico. Muy muy muy. 

CASTRO

Well good, then you can have your pick. 

GEORGE

Oh, oh! 

CASTRO

They will play for your Yankees. 

GEORGE

Oh well, gracias El Commandante, gracias. Muy muy. 

CASTRO

And I would be honored if you would be my guest for dinner tonight at the Presidential palace. There will be girls there and, I hear, some pretty good food. Of course the problem with parties is you invariably have to eat standing up which I don't care for but on the other hand I don't like to balance a plate on my lap either. Once when I was at a party, I put my plate on someone's piano. I assure you, if I had not been a dictator, I would not have been able to get away with that one. 

JERRY

Come on. Lets go 

ELAINE

No wait, I gotta go in here and pick up Mr. Pitt's tennis recquet. 

JERRY

What's it doin here? 

ELAINE

He wanted to have it restrung. (to clerk) Here I need to pick that up 

LANDIS

Hello 

ELAINE

Oh, Hi. 

LANDIS

Jocylin Landis from Doubleday. I interviewed you for a position a couple of months ago. 

ELAINE

Yes, yes, the one I didn't get. (they giggle) 

LANDIS

I was watching you play 

ELAINE

Oh, I'm not very good. 

LANDIS

No. You exhibited a lot of grace out there. 

ELAINE

Really? Grace? 

LANDIS

Yes. So have you found anything yet? 

ELAINE

Uh, no. Not really. 

LANDIS

You know you should keep in touch. Something may be opening up in a few weeks. Is that a Bruline? 

JERRY

Oh, Bruline. Newman's got the same one. 

ELAINE

Newman plays tennis? 

JERRY

He's fantastic. 

LANDIS

Would you mind if I tried this out? 

ELAINE

Uh, no ... take it. 

LANDIS

How will you get it back? 

ELAINE

Um, I could come by your office and pick it up tomorrow. 

LANDIS

That's so generous of you. 

ELAINE

Thanks 

JERRY

You loaned her Pitt's racquet? 

ELAINE

What could I do? She said there might be something for me at Doubleday. Oh wouldn't that be great I wouldn't have to work for Mr. Pitt anymore. 

SANDY

I gotta get going. 

JERRY

Oh, OK. Next time lets play ping pong. It's easier to jump over the net. 

SANDY

(nods silently) 

ELAINE

Bye 

JERRY

Bye bye 

ELAINE

Have you noticed she never laughs 

JERRY

Hm, really? 

ELAINE

Yeah 

GEORGE

Check that out (showing newspaper) 

KRAMER

Whoa, you're dating this woman? 

GEORGE

That's right. 

KRAMER

George, you're becoming one of the gliterratti 

GEORGE

What's that. 

KRAMER

Ya' know, people who glitter. She's a slim gal. 

GEORGE

And the amazing thing is she eats like there's no tomorra'. I mean I've never seen an appetite like this. Desserts. Everything. I don't know how she does it. 

KRAMER

Maybe she's bulimic 

GEORGE

Wa? 

KRAMER

Bulimic, 

GEORGE

Kramer, she's a model. 

KRAMER

Exactly 

GEORGE

I have noticed she does tend to go to the bathroom right after we finish eating. 

KRAMER

There you go monkey boy. 

NINA

Mmm, Mmmm oh, so good, mmm, mmm. Aren't you hungry? 

GEORGE

Just enjoying watching you. 

SANDY

So did you like the movie? 

JERRY

Yeah, it was OK. Frankenstein didn't seem quite right to me. I missed the sport jacket. 

SANDY

(nods silently) 

JERRY

Not that it was that nice of a jacket. I mean it didn't fit him that well. To me there's just something about a monster in a blazer. It shows at least he's making an effort. 

SANDY

(nods silently) That's funny. 

JERRY

I'm glad you enjoyed it. 

NINA

Oh, I'm so full. 

GEORGE

Yes, full. I love to be full ... love to sit back, loosen the old belt and digest away for hours. Let those enzymes do their work. 

NINA

Will you excuse me. 

GEORGE

Where you going? 

NINA

I just need to freshen up. 

GEORGE

You're fresh (grabs her arm) You're very fresh. You seem very fresh to me. You're very vital. I couldn't take you any fresher. 

NINA

George I need to freshen., George, George, George ... 

JERRY

It was unbelievable. You're right the jokes kept bouncing off her like superman. 

ELAINE

See, what did I tell ya? 

JERRY

And even when she did like something, she doesn't laugh. She says, 'That's funny.' ... That's funny! 

ELAINE

Oo, I better call that woman at Doubleday and see when I can pick up Mr. Pitt's racquet. 

JERRY

I mean how can I be with someone that doesn't laugh. It's like ... well it's like something! 

ELAINE

(on phone)Hello, yeah, hi. Uh, is Miss. Landis there please. Wa? Oh, Gosh, ah ok, she'll be in later? OK, thank you. Uh. (to Jerry) This guy said she hurt her arm playing tennis. ... Pretty bad. 

GEORGE

Well, I heard a noise. 

JERRY

What noise? 

GEORGE

You know, .. blah ... 

JERRY

What blah? 

GEORGE

From the bathroom. 

JERRY

Oh, you think she was refunding? 

GEORGE

Every time we go out to eat the minute we we're done eating she's runnin to the bathroom. 

ELAINE

So you're concerned. 

GEORGE

Elaine, of course I'm concerned. I'm payin' for those meals. It's like throwing money down the toilet. 

JERRY

In a manner of speaking. 

GEORGE

Let me digest it. Let me get my money's worth. Y'know what would be good is if there was someone else in the bathroom that could tell me. 

KRAMER

Here's your scrubber back. 

JERRY

Thanks. 

GEORGE

Hey, maybe I could bribe one of those women that hand out the towels in the powder room. 

JERRY

A matron? 

GEORGE

Yeah 

JERRY

uh, well I can't help you there (weakly). 

GEORGE

Wha? 

KRAMER

Nothin' 

GEORGE

You know a matron? 

KRAMER

Me? 

GEORGE

You 

KRAMER

No. 

GEORGE

Kramer, 

KRAMER

Well, now look, just leave me alone. 

GEORGE

Well, what is it? 

KRAMER

No, don't, don't make me 

GEORGE

Wha? 

KRAMER

No, I can't, all right I can't ... 

GEORGE

Who? 

KRAMER

... My mother's a matron! 

ELAINE

Babs? 

KRAMER

Yeah, there, all right I said it there.. Ya' satisfied? Anything else you want to know? 

GEORGE

Kramer, Kramer, I need to know if Nina is refunding. 

KRAMER

Look, George, I can't help ya, all right. 

GEORGE

Why not? Why not? 

KRAMER

let me go. let me go. Because I haven't talked to my mother in five years. We just don't see eye to eye. I don't even want to get into my childhood. I'm still carrying a lot of pain. A LOT of pain. 

GEORGE

Come on, Kramer. 

KRAMER

I can't I can't 

JERRY

Kramer you're going to have to face her some time 

KRAMER

(mumbles) b'd b'd 

ELAINE

Hello (sees Landis) Oh, my goodness. What happened? 

LANDIS

I tore my umeral epicondilitist 

ELAINE

Oh 

LANDIS

My doctor said it might never fully heal. I may never play again. 

ELAINE

Oh, you'll be playing ... 

LANDIS

If I can't play tennis I don't know what I'll do. 

ELAINE

There are plenty of things you can do, there's chess and uh uh mah jong, 

LANDIS

You don't know how lucky you are to be healthy ... 

ELAINE

... and biking and .. 

LANDIS

What am I going to do? 

ELAINE

... hiking ... 

LANDIS

(wimpers) 

ELAINE

(sees racquet) Could I ... 

LANDIS

If I can't play tennis I have no reason to live .. (cries) 

ELAINE

(sees racquet), You know it's not important I'm gonna, ok, well, you know. Take care of that condolitis 

KRAMER

Ma? 

BABS

Cosmo! 

GEORGE

Cosmo? 

JERRY

Why didn't you just ask her for it? 

ELAINE

I told you I couldn't. The woman was crying about how she might never play tennis again 

JERRY

Yeah 

GEORGE

Hey di ho 

JERRY

C'mon up. 

JERRY

So when do you have to get the racquet back to Mr. Pitt? 

ELAINE

augh, he's got a big match tomorrow with Ethyl Kennedy 

JERRY

He needs a three hundred-dollar Bruline to beat Ethyl Kennedy? 

ELAINE

He'll only play with his racquet 

JERRY

Well, why don't you wait 'til she's not there on her lunch hour and just take it? 

ELAINE

That's stealing? 

JERRY

Stealing? You loaned her the racquet! 

ELAINE

I know. 

GEORGE

Hey oh. 

ELAINE

JERRY: Hey 

JERRY

So what happened with Kramer's mother? 

GEORGE

It's all worked out. Nina and I will have dinner Thursday at the restaurant where Babs works. 

JERRY

What's she like? 

GEORGE

Oh, she's a Kramer. And uh, while I was there I uh happened to pick up another juicy little nugget about our friend. 

ELAINE

Ah, I'm ready what? 

JERRY

What is it? 

GEORGE

I uh got the first name. 

ELAINE

You found out Kramer's first name? 

GEORGE

That's right. You ready? 

JERRY

We've been trying to get it out of him for ten years. What is it? 

GEORGE

Cosmo 

ELAINE

JERRY: Cosmo? 

GEORGE

Cosmo 

ELAINE

JERRY: Cosmo 

ELAINE

Cosmo, Cosmo? 

KRAMER

What's so funny? ... wha? 

ELAINE

COSMO? 

KRAMER

All right, OK So you the name now. The cat is .a a a .. out of the bag. 

ELAINE

It's not such a bad name. 

KRAMER

Well you know all my life I've been running away from that name. That's why I wouldn't tell anybody. But I've been thinking about it. All this time I'm trying not to be me. I'm afraid to face who I was. But I'm Cosmo Jerry. I'm Cosmo Kramer. And that's who I'm going to be. From now on that's who I'm going to be. I'm Cosmo! 

LAURA

Yes? 

JERRY

Hi, is Sandy here? 

LAURA

Hi, you must be Jerry. Sandy's in the shower. Do you want to come in? 

JERRY

I would except I forgot to bring a towel. 

LAURA

(laughs nicely) 

JERRY

So the roommate laughed at everything I said. 

GEORGE

Wow. 

JERRY

It was a great sounding laugh too, kind of lilting and feminine--none of those big coarse 'ha's.' You know those? 

GEORGE

Oh yeah: HA-A-A, HA-A-A. 

JERRY

Yeah. 

GEORGE

Hate the big coarse 'ha.' Hate those. 

JERRY

And the worst part of course is that she also possessed many of the other qualities prized by the Superficial Man. 

GEORGE

I see. 

JERRY

So as you can see, I've got a bit of a problem here. 

GEORGE

Well, if I hear you correctly--and I think that I do--my advice to you is to finish your meal, pay your check, leave here, and never mention this to anyone again. 

JERRY

Can't be done, huh? 

GEORGE

The Switch? 

JERRY

'The Switch.' 

GEORGE

Can't be done. 

JERRY

I wonder. 

GEORGE

Do you realize in the entire history of western civilization no one has successfully accomplished the Roommate Switch? In the Middle Ages you could get locked up for even suggesting it! 

JERRY

They didn't have roommates in the Middle Ages. 

GEORGE

Well, I'm sure at some point between the years 800 and 1200--somewhere--there were two women living together. 

JERRY

The point is I intend to undertake this. And I'll do it with or without you. So if you're scared, if you haven't got the stomach for this, let's get it out right now! And I'll go on my own. If not, you can get on board and we can get to work! Now what's it going to be? 

GEORGE

All right, dammit, I'm in. 

JERRY

I couldn't do it without you. 

GEORGE

All right. Let's get to work. 

GEORGE

All right. That's enough for today. You're tired. Get some sleep. I'll see you first thing in the morning. 

JERRY

Aw, we can't do it, who are we kidding? It's impossible! It's true! You can't do the Switch! Nobody can do the Switch! It was a stupid idea to begin with! Let's face it. I'm stuck with the non-laugher and that's that! 

GEORGE

We'll come up with something. 

JERRY

Yeah, sure we will. 

GEORGE

All right. See you tomorrow. (George sighs, exits.) 

GEORGE

I-I-I-I-I got it!!!!! 

GEORGE

All right. Let's go over it again, one more time. 

JERRY

All right. So I tell Sandy that I want to have a m&eacute;nage &agrave; trois with her and her roommate. 

GEORGE

That's right. 

JERRY

And you believe this course of action will have a two-pronged effect. Firstly, the very mention of the idea will cause Sandy to recoil in disgust, whereupon she will insist that I remove myself from the premises. 

GEORGE

Keep going. 

JERRY

At this point, it is inevitable that she will seek out the roommate to apprise her of this abhorrent turn of events. 

GEORGE

Continue. 

JERRY

The roommate will then offer her friend the requisite sympathy even as part of her cannot help but feel somewhat flattered by her inclusion in the unusual request. 

GEORGE

A few days go by and a call is placed at a time when Sandy is known to be busy at work. Once the initial awkwardness is relieved with a little playful humor, which she [Laura] of course cannot resist, an invitation to a friendly dinner is proffered. 

JERRY

Huh. Well, it all sounds pretty good. There's only one flaw in it: They're roommates. She'd have to go out with me behind Sandy's back. She's not gonna do that. 

GEORGE

You disappoint me, my friend. Sandy wants nothing to do with you. She tells Laura, 'If you want to waste your time with that pervert, that's your problem.' 

JERRY

It's a perfect plan. So inspired. So devious. Yet so simple. 

GEORGE

(George, finger in the peanut butter jar): This is what I do. 

KEITH

Can I help you? 

ELAINE

Uh, no, I'm OK. 

KEITH

Well then what are you doing with that racquet? 

ELAINE

Um, it's mine. Miss. Landis borrowed it. 

KEITH

Well, I'm sorry you can't take that, no no no.. 

ELAINE

No no no, I can. I can. It's mine. It's my racquet. 

KEITH

Look sweetheart I don't know who you are. I don't know what you're doing here. But... 

ELAINE

All right. I'm going I'm going 

KEITH

Not with ... 

ELAINE

Give it give it .. 

KEITH

Leave ... 

ELAINE

All right all right forget it. You don't have to mention any of this to Miss. Landis do you? 

KEITH

I don't have to but I will. 

CLOTWORTHY

Morning Cosmo 

KRAMER

Hi Mr. Clotworthy 

CLOTWORTHY

KRAMER

Ah couldn't be better. Hi Lorraine.

Lorraine 

KRAMER

Yes, It's a fine day 

VOICE

(Larry David's voice) What do you say Cosmo? 

KRAMER

Hey, everything my man. 

SANDY

What: 

JERRY

You know, I don't know the exact pronunciation but I believe its Manage A Trois. 

SANDY

Oooo, that is a wild idea 

JERRY

Uh? 

KRAMER

You ma, know I've been thinking. I want you to quit that matron job. 

BABS

Yes, well isn't that just easy for you to say. What the hell do you think I'm going to do with myself? 

KRAMER

Well maybe we could go into business together. If you're clean? 

BABS

I've been clean for two years. Anyway what would we do together? 

KRAMER

I've got plenty of ideas. 

BABS

I've always believed in you Cosmo. You know that. So I want you to call that place today and tell then tha you're through. 

BABS

All right. I'll do it. 

NINA

Mmmm mm so good. 

GEORGE

... so glad. 

NINA

Will you excuse me I've got to freshen up. 

GEORGE

And why shouldn't you? Be fresh Stay fresh 

WOMAN

I'll be back. I'm not feeling very well. 

WAITRESS

Care to see our dessert menu? 

GEORGE

Uh, yeah. Do you know Babs? 

WAITRESS

Oh, yeah I was sorry to hear she left. 

GEORGE

Babs left? 

WAITRESS

She quit today. 

GEORGE

Ah Ha. 

NINA

What are you doing here George? 

GEORGE

I was just wondering what it was you wanted for dessert. 

GEORGE

How 'ya feelin'? 

BABS

Hi Newman 

NEWMAN

Hi Babs 

BABS

What are you doin' 

NEWMAN

Minding my own business. 

BABS

You'll never get into trouble that way. 

NEWMAN

What makes you think I'm lookin' for trouble? 

BABS

From what I hear you postmen don't have to look too far. 

NEWMAN

ha ha ha Well you know sometimes it just has a way of finding you. Cigarette? 

BABS

Don't mind if I do. 

JERRY

Hey 

GEORGE

What happened to Babs. She never showed up last night. The whole thing blew up in my face. 

JERRY

Ah, that's a shame. 

GEORGE

Hey, what happened with Sandy. I forgot all about it. Did you call her? 

JERRY

Yeah, I did. In fact I went over there. 

GEORGE

So what happened? She throw you out? Eh? 

JERRY

No actually, she took it pretty well. 

GEORGE

So what happened? 

JERRY

She's into it. 

GEORGE

Into what? 

JERRY

The manage. And not only that. She just called me and said she talked to the roommate and the roomate's into the manage too. 

GEORGE

That's unbelievable. 

JERRY

Oh, it's a scene man. 

GEORGE

Do you ever just get down on your knees and thank god that you know me and have access to my dementia? 

JERRY

What are you talking about? I'm not goin' to do it. 

GEORGE

You're not goin to do it? What do you mean, You're not goin to do it? 

JERRY

I can't. I'm not an orgy guy. 

GEORGE

Are you crazy? This is like discovering Plutonium ... by accident. 

JERRY

Don't you know what it means to become an orgy guy? It changes everything. I'd have to dress different. I'd have to act different. I'd have to grow a mustache and get all kinds of robes and lotions and I'd need a new bedspread and new curtains I'd have to get thick carpeting and weirso lighting. I'd have to get new friends. I'd have to get orgy friends. ... Naw, I'm not ready for it. 

GEORGE

If only something like that could happen to me. 

JERRY

Oh, shut up you couldn't do it either. 

GEORGE

I know. 

JERRY

Hey, what happened? Did you get your racquet? 

ELAINE

No, I got caught. 

JERRY

What do you mean you got caught? 

ELAINE

Her assistant caught me. And now I'm probably not going to get a job. He's going to tell Landis that I was sneakin around her office. 

JERRY

I still don't understand how you can get in trouble for taking your own racquet. 

ELAINE

Meanwhile Mr. Pitt's got this match with Ethyl Kennedy this afternoon. 

KRAMER

Hey. 

JERRY

Hi Cosmo. 

ELAINE

Hi Cosmo 

KRAMER

Thanks man. 

JERRY

Hey, doesn't Newman have a Bruline racquet? 

KRAMER

Uh, Yeah, yeah, but he's on vacation. Went to Baltimore. 

JERRY

Hum, but you've got the key to his place right? 

KRAMER

Yeah 

JERRY

Well Elaine needs to borrow his racquet. Just for today. 

KRAMER

All right all right. Come on I'll take you over to Newman's 

GEORGE

Hey, Cosmo what happened to your mother last night. She hung me out to dry. 

KRAMER

She quit. 

GEORGE

It would have been nice if someone told me about it. I just think you could have said something. That's all. 

KRAMER

Don't talk to me George, talk to her. 

GEORGE

Well where is she? 

KRAMER

I don't know. 

KRAMER

Ma! 

BABS

Cosmo! 

NEWMAN

We din, we didn't ... ... Cosmo? 

KRAMER

Watch it good. 

GEORGE

(bewildered)&nbsp; Heh heh. 

GEORGE

I gotta find a way to work this out, I love that apartment.&nbsp; It's so cozy, I'm ensconced in velvet.&nbsp; You know, if it were socially acceptable-- 

KRAMER

(entering)&nbsp; Hey. 

GEORGE

(eating a pickle)&nbsp; Well they're his tickets, he can do what he wants with them. 

NEWMAN

(squeezing himself through the narrow space)&nbsp; Nothing, just being neighborly.&nbsp; Do you wanna hang out?&nbsp; Shoot the breeze? 

NEWMAN

(leaving)&nbsp; Oh, by the way, what are you doing for the Super Bowl? 

JERRY

(as Newman leaves)&nbsp; Newman! 

SCOTT

(to Bonnie) Are you gonna need the bathroom?&nbsp; 'Cause I'm gonna jump in the shower. 

JERRY

(still outside)&nbsp; What was that? 

NEWMAN

(fleeing to the bedroom)&nbsp; Damn! 

JERRY

(after entering)&nbsp; The bedroom! 

GEORGE

(walking towards the door)&nbsp; I couldn't leave well enough alone?! 

KRAMER

(rolling the dice) Yeah.&nbsp; I am taking over South America and there ain't nothing you can do about it. 

JERRY

(walking out)&nbsp; Thanks for having me over, guys. 

TIM

Oh, Elaine.&nbsp; Yeah, well, things just didn't work out like I thought they would. 

KRAMER

(running to the window)&nbsp; What?!&nbsp; Not my car!!&nbsp; Hey!!&nbsp; They're towing my car!! 

TIM

(startled)&nbsp; Elaine, hi. 

ELAINE

(visibly upset)&nbsp; Well, I bought it for you because you were so nice to me for not charging me for the dental work.&nbsp; The way you worked on my filling, you were so, so gentle and so caring and so sensitive. 

GEORGE

(internally)&nbsp; How am I gonna get out of this?&nbsp; Think Costanza, think! 

GARY

Hey George. 

GEORGE

Gary? Well, well, well well. Where the hell've you been? I've been leaving you phone messages for months. 

GARY

I know. I've been pretty busy. 

GEORGE

Busy. Don't give me busy. Who's not busy? I'm busy, we're all busy, everybody's busy. All right, tell me, what's kept you so busy? 

GARY

Mostly chemotherapy. 'Kay, I'll see you. 

KRAMER

(to car as it accelerates away) Hey pig! 

COP

(at car) Hey! Hey! Hey! 

JERRY

So you called the cop a pig? 

KRAMER

I was yelling at the litterbug. I mean this is my town. You don't throw trash on the streets of my town. 

JERRY

Didn't you explain that to the cop? 

KRAMER

No, I fled the scene. 

JERRY

(to George) Hey. 

KRAMER

(to George) Hey buddy. 

GEORGE

Hey, uh... 

KRAMER

What? 

GEORGE

Kramer, I, I, I, uh, I need to talk to Jerry privately. 

KRAMER

Oh. What about? 

GEORGE

Kramer... 

KRAMER

Aw come on George, you can share it with me, huh? 

GEORGE

Hey, you're hurting me! 

KRAMER

You gonna share it with me next time, huh? 

GEORGE

I swear, I swear! 

KRAMER

Aw, all right, I'm looking forward to it. 

GEORGE

Right, I got news. You ready? (deep breath) Gary Fogel had cancer. 

JERRY

Oh yeah, I knew. 

GEORGE

You knew? How did you know? 

JERRY

He told me a few months ago. 

GEORGE

Why did he tell you and not me? 

JERRY

I don't know. 

GEORGE

How are you closer to him than me? 

GEORGE

So, is he okay? 

JERRY

Oh yeah, he's fine, fine. He was in bad shape for a while though. 

GEORGE

Huh, really? How bad? Was he on his death bed? 

JERRY

No, he was on his regular bed. 

GEORGE

So why didn't you tell me? 

JERRY

He swore me to secrecy. 

GEORGE

So? 

JERRY

It's not like you're my wife. 

GEORGE

Well, I still think you shoulda told me. 

JERRY

Hey, believe me, you were better off not knowing. It's not easy to deal with someone in a situation like this. I was so nice to him I almost made myself sick. 

GEORGE

Well, I wanna talk to him about this. 

JERRY

That's right, you let him have it. 

GEORGE

Mmm-mm. 

JERRY

Who is he not to tell you about his life-threatening illness? 

GEORGE

That's what I'm saying. 

JERRY

His illness is your business. 

GEORGE

If not mine, whose? 

JERRY

If not now, when? 

ELAINE

Were you just talking about me? 

GEORGE

No, an old friend of ours, Gary. 

ELAINE

Oh, the guy with cancer? 

GEORGE

(to Jerry, yelling) You told her? She's not your wife! 

JERRY

If I told you, you woulda given it away. 

GEORGE

You don't think I can keep a secret? 

JERRY

No, but he would've read your face. 

GEORGE

You don't trust my poker face? 

JERRY

Do you ever win at poker? 

GEORGE

(shamefaced) No. 

KRAMER

Hey. (to Elaine) Oh, I just saw your old boyfriend on TV. 

ELAINE

Egh, Jake Jarmel? 

KRAMER

Yeah. I really liked those glasses he was wearing. Where'd he get those. 

ELAINE

Why? You don't wear glasses. 

KRAMER

I know, I know. But I need a new look, I'm stagnating. 

GEORGE

I have to say, as a glasses wearer I take exception to that. That's like me buying a wheelchair to cruise around in. 

KRAMER

Yeah, I've considered that. (to Elaine) Look, how do I get in touch with this guy? 

ELAINE

Well, he's having a two day book signing at Waldens. 

KRAMER

Ah. 

ELAINE

You know, we had a really bad break-up. 

JERRY

The Jujy Fruits? 

ELAINE

(upset) Yeah, the Jujy Fruits. 

JAKE

Okay, K-Man, enjoy the book. 

KRAMER

Okay, thank you. Listen Jake, uh, where did you get those eyeglass frames? 

JAKE

I can't tell you that. 

KRAMER

So you don't know where you got 'em? 

JAKE

Yes I do. But I don't want anyone else to have them. 

KRAMER

Well, that's peculiar. (leaves) 

GEORGE

Eh, there's that woman that never talks to anybody. 

GARY

Really? 

GEORGE

Every day she comes in, she sits at that table and reads. Never talks to anybody. 

GARY

Oh, I talked to Debby Bibelo. She said to say hi. 

GEORGE

(pleasant surprise) Really? (admonishing) You know Gary, I really have to say, I'm a little bit hurt that you didn't decide to confide in me. 

GARY

Well frankly, you can't keep a secret. You know, you'd get two pair, the whole table knows. 

GEORGE

Well I still think it was wrong. 

GARY

Right, well I'm sorry, all right. I guess I was just thinking of myself. 

GEORGE

(well, obviously) Yes. 

KRAMER

...so I called the litterbug a pig, not you. I like policeman. I wanted to be a policeman. 

COP

Yeah? So why didn't you? 

KRAMER

Scared of being shot. 

COP

Mr Kramer, let me tell you a story. In nineteen-seventy-nine I ticketed a brown Dodge Diplomat for parking in a Church zone. That fine was never paid, and since then that scofflaw has piled up more parking tickets than anyone in New York City. For sixteen years I pursued him, only to see him give me the slip time and time again. I never got a clean look at his face, but he's become my 'white whale'. Mr Kramer, that day was yesterday! But thanks to you, I don't know if I'll ever get that chance again! 

KRAMER

I like that eye patch. 

GEORGE

(standing) All right, I'm gonna move my car, my meter's up. Can't park in this city. 

GARY

(standing) Hey, George, listen. You know that company I work for, they own that parking lot around the corner. 

GEORGE

Wha, that's a Kinney lot? 

GARY

Yeah, and there's a space opening up, and I could get it for you. You just have to pay the tax on it. It'd be like, fifty a month. 

GEORGE

Fifty bucks a month, that's incredible! Okay, thanks. 

GARY

All right, I got lunch, all right. 

GEORGE

You still owe me a secret. 

GARY

All right, listen. There is something I haven't told you, all right? 

GEORGE

Yeah? 

GARY

Yeah, but uhm, you can't tell Jerry. 

GEORGE

What do think I tell Jerry everything? It's not like he's my wife. 

GARY

Okay. Well, the thing is, I've been living a lie. 

GEORGE

Just one? I'm living like twenty. (chuckles) What's yours? 

GARY

Well, I (laughs) I never actually had cancer. (laughs) I'll see you. (leaves) 

ELAINE

So he refused to tell you where he got the glasses? 

KRAMER

(rising) Flat out refused! (walks past Jerry, who moves his legs) 

ELAINE

Yeah, isn't that just like him? (she steps over Jerry's legs) You know, he has to be the only one who has 'em. 

KRAMER

Yeah, tell me about it, soul sister. (he opens the door to leave) Anyway, I told Jake that you said hi. 

ELAINE

What? (she slams the door shut before Kramer can exit) You told Jake I said hi? 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

ELAINE

I can't believe you did that! Why did you tell him I said hi? I never said hi! (to Jerry) When did I say hi? 

JERRY

I never heard her say hi. 

KRAMER

Well, it's uh, common courtesy. 

ELAINE

No, no. (stamps foot) Kramer, you don't understand. He made the last contact between us. I had the upper hand in the post-breakup relationship. If he thinks that I said hi, then I lose the upper hand. 

JERRY

It's like a game of tag. 

JERRY

Where you going? 

ELAINE

Nowhere. 

JERRY

You're going to the book store to see Jake Jarmel, aren't you? 

ELAINE

So what if I do? (heads for the door) 

KRAMER

(to the exiting Elaine) Yeah, well, listen. If you're going there, (following her out the door) maybe you can get him to tell you where he got those glasses. (shouting after her) Elaine! 

JERRY

Hey. How'd it go with Gary? 

GEORGE

(shifty, avoiding Jerry's eyes) Fine, fine. (he removes his coat) 

JERRY

(suspicious) Really? 

GEORGE

(shifty) Yeah. 

JERRY

You look like something's on your mind. 

GEORGE

No. Nothing. Fine. (he sits at the table) 

JERRY

So, that's your poker face. 

GEORGE

My regular face. 

JERRY

No it isn't. I've seen your regular face. That is not it. 

GEORGE

What are you saying? 

JERRY

All right George, c'mon, what d'you got? (sits opposite George) 

GEORGE

I got nothing. 

JERRY

What you got, a pair of bullets? 

GEORGE

What you talking about? 

JERRY

Two pair? Three of a kind? 

GEORGE

Will you stop it? 

JERRY

Oh my God, you got a flush! You're holding a flush! 

GEORGE

I don't have a flush. 

JERRY

A full house? You got a full house? Turn 'em over George, I wanna see 'em. Come on, I'm calling! (thumps hand on table) What d'you got! 

GEORGE

(broken, shouts) Gary Fogel never had cancer! 

ELAINE

So you see, Kramer took it upon himself to say hi to you from me. When in fact it was an unauthorised hi. 

JAKE

You're saying you didn't say hi. 

ELAINE

That's what I'm saying. 

JAKE

So that's what you came down here to tell me? 

ELAINE

Correct. 

JAKE

You never said hi? 

ELAINE

Correct. 

JAKE

You still like me, don't you? 

ELAINE

Correct. (catches herself) What's that? 

MAN

Hey, I have been trying to get this book signed all day. 

ELAINE

(takes the book from the guy and signs it herself) How can you say that I still like you, when I didn't even say hi to you? 

JAKE

Elaine, coming down here to say that you didn't say hi is more of a gesture than if you did say hi. 

ELAINE

Ah, Jake... (realises his logic) I, uh... 

GEORGE

The doctors thought he had cancer, but the surgery revealed he never actually had it. 

JERRY

So what was wrong with him? 

GEORGE

Nothing! 

JERRY

So he's been lying to me for two months?! 

GEORGE

That's right. 

JERRY

What kind of person is this? There's only one other person who might be able to do something like this, and that's you. 

GEORGE

Well... 

JERRY

I don't even think you could do it. 

GEORGE

Oh, I could do it. 

JERRY

Yeah, I guess you could. 

GEORGE

(snorts) C'mon. 

JERRY

Did you know he was so worried about losing more hair if he had to get chemo treatment, I bought him an unlimited gift certificate at the Hair Team For Men, just to put his mind at ease? 

GEORGE

You did that? 

JERRY

Yeah. Oh, I can't wait to talk to this guy. (moves to pick up phone) 

GEORGE

Wait a minute, wait a minute. You can't say anything. (rushes to take phone from Jerry) 

JERRY

Why not? 

GEORGE

(puts down handset) Because he'll know I told you. Besides, he's giving me a parking spot around the corner for practically nothing. 

JERRY

So you're telling me, because you're getting free parking, I gotta pretend this guy had cancer when he didn't? 

GEORGE

Yeah. 

JERRY

Well I don't like it. I don't like it one bit! And, I'm supposed to see him tomorrow. 

GEORGE

Yeah, well you have to maintain the same disposition too. You can't start acting any differently. You have to be nice. 

JERRY

Why didn't he tell me? 

GEORGE

Because you were being so nice. 

JERRY

I don't think I can be that nice. 

GEORGE

(shouts) You be nice! 

JERRY

Gary? 

GARY

What d'you think? Check it out. (he tries a number of expressions, turning his head side to side, to show off the hairpiece) 

JERRY

Is that from my gift certificate? 

GARY

Yeah buddy. You really came through for me man. You've been so nice. (shakes Jerry by the hand) 

JERRY

(through gritted teeth) Yeah, well, I'm glad you could take advantage. 

GARY

Hey, you know what I'm thinking of doing? I'm getting rid of all my fillings, 'cos that mercury's toxic. Hey, let me see your fillings. 

JERRY

I don't think so. 

GARY

Oh come on, open up. Let me take a look. 

GEORGE

You be nice! He's giving me a parking space (echoes) parking space... parking space... 

GARY

(peering in) Well, what d'you know. Hey, lookee there, you're loaded. 

JERRY

Okay. (shuts mouth) 

GARY

Hey, look who's over there. Miss Cool-toes. Check this out, Jack! (rises) 

KRAMER

(to Jerry) Hey buddy. 

JERRY

Hey. Look at you. Wha... what's this? 

KRAMER

It's an eyepatch. 

JERRY

You look like a pirate. 

KRAMER

I wanna be a pirate. 

JERRY

(gesturing) This is Gary. 

KRAMER

(to Gary) How you doing? 

GARY

All right. 

KRAMER

Well, I tell you there's only one problem. 

JERRY

Can't see on your right side? 

KRAMER

No. It's uh, (swaps patch to the other eye) it's itchy 

DEBBY

Nice car. 

GEORGE

Yeah. Once belonged to Jon Voight. 

DEBBY

So, what made you just call me out of the blue like that? 

GEORGE

Oh, well, uh. Gary told me you said hi. 

DEBBY

I didn't say hi. 

GEORGE

You didn't? 

DEBBY

Uh, no. I told him to send you my regards. I didn't say hi. 

GEORGE

Regards? 

DEBBY

Yeah, regards. 

ELAINE

Anyway, I admit I was dumb to go to the bookstore to tell him I didn't say hi, but he didn't have to act so smug. Oh, I hate smugness. Don't you hate smugness? 

CABBIE

(heavy accent) Smugness is not a good quality. 

ELAINE

(looking out of window) Oh my God. That man over there. I think he's wearing glasses that look just like Jake's. Pull over, stop the car. (hands money to cabbie as she exits) Here, here. I think I got a way of getting back at my ex-boyfriend. 

CABBIE

Good. Revenge is very good. 

ELAINE

(calling down street) 'Scuse me! 'Scuse me. (catches up to guy) Excuse me, sir. Sir? 

GUY

Yes? 

ELAINE

Uh. Ah, if you don't mind my asking, could you tell me where you got your glasses? 

GUY

Malaysia. 

ELAINE

Malaysia? 

GUY

Yeah. 

ELAINE

Uhm, look, I know this'll sound odd, but can I buy them from you? 

GUY

Actually, I was gonna buy a new pair. 

ELAINE

(positive) Oh! (little chuckle) 

GUY

But I, I can barely see without these. 

ELAINE

C'mon. 

GUY

Well, these were expensive. 

ELAINE

Let's start the bidding. 

GEORGE

So, you didn't think this was a date? 

DEBBY

N... no, not really. Why, is it... a date? 

GEORGE

I thought it was a date. 

DEBBY

No. It's not a date. 

GEORGE

What about the regards? 

DEBBY

Regards don't mean anything. I mean, it's not like I said hi. Hey, the fact is... (sighs) I shouldn't say anything. 

GEORGE

No, tell me. 

DEBBY

Can you keep a secret? 

GEORGE

Me? Oh yeah. 

DEBBY

(deep breath) I never had feelings for Gary until he got sick. But, h... he was so brave and... and gained such a wonderful perspective on life. I... I fell in love with him. 

GEORGE

Oh, the guy's got some perspective there. 

JERRY

Hey, do you know what the Whip does? 

KRAMER

What whip? 

JERRY

The Whip. In the Senate, in the House. 

KRAMER

Well, you know in the old days, when the senators didn't vote the way that the party leaders wanted 'em to... they whipped them. (holds imaginary whip) You better vote the way we want you to, or there's gonna be big trouble. (cracks invisible whip and makes sound effect) 

GARY

She won't talk to anyone, huh? Oh no, she won't say a word to anybody. Well, she's talking a blue streak now, Jack! 

COP

Well, well. The 'white whale'. 

GEORGE

(frustrated) Oh, look at this. There's no place to park around here. I don't even know why they sell cars in Manhattan. 

DEBBY

Don't complain, at least you have your health. 

DEBBY

George, look out for that man! 

COP

(to escaping car) Hey! Hey, get back here! 

KRAMER

(looking after fleeing car) Newman! The white whale! 

GEORGE

Can you believe he sold his glasses on the street? 

JERRY

Can you believe someone would lie about chemotherapy to get a wig? Would you do that? 

GEORGE

No. Definitely not. 

JERRY

Yeah. 

GEORGE

I'm pretty sure I wouldn't. 

JERRY

And you know what else? He picked up that woman in the coffee shop. 

GEORGE

The one who always sits by herself? 

JERRY

Yeah! 

GEORGE

How did he do that? 

JERRY

Because he was brimming with confidence from the toupee. 

GEORGE

Really? And Debby told me that she fell in love with him because he has all this perspective! 

JERRY

She thinks a guy who lies about a life-threatening illness, so he can get some phony hair has perspective? 

GEORGE

(opening door to leave) He picked her up? 

JERRY

Walked right over to her table. 

GEORGE

Wow. (he runs his fingers through his hair, and then brushes the resulting fallout off his jacket) 

ELAINE

Jake, Jake. Take a look. (puts on the frames she bought) Aaw, see, you're not the only one who has 'em. I have them too. 

JAKE

Where did you get those? 

ELAINE

Malaysia. I was in the area. 

NEWMAN

(surprised) Kramer. 

KRAMER

Just drive. 

KRAMER

All right. Now you listen, and you listen good. I know who you are. You're the scofflaw. 

NEWMAN

(defensive) What're you talking about... 

KRAMER

(interrupting) Ah, don't play dumb. It's me, Cosmo. 

NEWMAN

All right, so it's me. So what? 

KRAMER

You don't think I know how you're feeling, every second of the day? Looking over your shoulder to see if someone's coming up from behind. Sitting alone at night, knowing they could be closing in. 

NEWMAN

I can't sleep, I tell you! I can't sleep! 

KRAMER

Ga, of course you can't, you poor sap! Now why didn't you tell me? 

NEWMAN

I couldn't. I couldn't tell anyone. 

KRAMER

So you been living this secret the whole time by yourself? 

NEWMAN

(sobbing) Yes, it's been awful. I wanted to tell somebody. (pleading) Help me Kramer! Help me! 

KRAMER

All right, all right, I'm gonna help you. 

GEORGE

I'll try some on and see how they look. It's just hair. 

JERRY

You ever see what that thing looks like in the back? You got your natural little curls on the bottom, and then that big phony mat coming down on top of 'em. 

GEORGE

Well, some of 'em look good. The ones that look good you don't even know about. 

JERRY

What if you get involved with a woman? How're you gonna tell her? 

GEORGE

The way they make 'em these days, I'll never have to tell her. 

JERRY

So you keep it a secret your whole life, then at your funeral the mortician comes out (as mortician) 'Here, Mrs Costanza, I thought you might want this'. (as Mrs Costanza, horrified) Aahh! 

LIPPMAN

It's no secret that it's my dream to have my own publishing house, and if this Jake Jarmel book does, you know, what I think it's gonna do. If I can get this whole thing off the ground, then , you know, I think I'll have something for you. (laughs) 

ELAINE

Oh, Mr Lippman. (joins laughter) That is so exciting. I mean, you have no idea how sick I am of running around town looking for socks. 

LIPPMAN

Yeah, by the way, those are great glasses. 

ELAINE

Oh really, you like 'em? 

LIPPMAN

Uh huh. Very unusual. 

ELAINE

Well, you know what? (removes glasses) 

LIPPMAN

What? 

ELAINE

(hands them over) You can have 'em. 

LIPPMAN

Oh, no no no. (waves them away) Please. 

ELAINE

No no no no. Go to that place on the corner, they'll change the prescription in an hour. Take 'em. 

LIPPMAN

Really? 

ELAINE

Yeah, I've no use for them anymore. Honestly. 

LIPPMAN

(accepting) I could use a new pair of reading glasses. 

ELAINE

They're from Malaysia. 

LIPPMAN

(putting on spectacles) Oh yeah? 

ELAINE

(admiring gasp) Fabulous. 

JUDGE

Well Mr Newman, in all my years on the bench, I have never come across anything quite like this. I have given this matter some very serious consideration and I've decided that what's best for the city and possibly for yourself, is for you to keep your car, in a garage... 

JUDGE

...convenient to your home. 

NEWMAN

(sobbing) I can't afford that! 

JUDGE

Afford it you will, Mr Newman. Or this court will see that your car is impounded... 

JUDGE

...and sold at auction. 

KRAMER

Well, don't you worry, your honour. He's in my custody. 

GEORGE

(to Jerry) Well, what d'you think? 

JERRY

(unimpressed) I, really can't say. 

GEORGE

No, say. I want you to say. 

JERRY

It's not good, okay. It's not good. You look (searches for word) stupid. (to salesman) I'm sorry. 

SALESMAN

You have to realise this has not been custom-fitted to his scalp. 

GEORGE

(examining reflection) I really think this looks pretty good. 

JERRY

Why don't you get a pair of white shoes, move down to Miami Beach and get the whole thing over with? 

GEORGE

(to salesman) Well, maybe you could show me something else. 

SALESMAN

As I said, it'll be different once we design something specifically for you. But I don't think your friend here is being very helpful. 

JERRY

Oh, hey, I'm being helpful. I am the only one being helpful! 

SALESMAN

(getting annoyed) No, I don't think you're being helpful! I think you're being disruptive, and you make it very difficult for your friend here to improve his life! 

JERRY

Hey! I'm trying to prevent my friend from becoming one of those guys people snicker at behind their back, because they look ridiculous! No offence to you personally! 

SALESMAN

(angry) All you people with hair think you're so damn superior! You have no idea what it's like. You ever look down in the bottom of your tub and see a fist fulla hair? How'd you like to start your day with that?! (looks ready to punch Jerry) 

JERRY

All right! Take it easy! Take it easy. 

GEORGE

(leaps to feet) Jerry! 

JERRY

I'm sorry. 

GEORGE

Please. (sits again) 

GARY

Hey Jerry, th... (spots George) George, you decided to get a rug! Good for you, Jack! 

GEORGE

Well, I'm, I'm just looking. 

GARY

Oh. (to salesman) Uh, Tommy, I'm gonna need a little adjustment. 

SALESMAN

I'll be right with you. 

GARY

Listen, George, I got some bad news. I'm not gonna be able to give you that parking space. 

GEORGE

What? 

JERRY

What? 

GARY

This judge has to use it for some scofflaw. And you know you can't fight City Hall. 

JERRY

You know, Gary (slams shut the door) I had a little chat with George the other day... 

GARY

(to George) You didn't?! 

GEORGE

(admiring himself in mirror) I did. 

JERRY

(advancing on Gary) ...and he told me that that... (becomes indistinct) 

GARY

(indistinct) I'm not a hundred percent recovered yet! 

JERRY

Gimme that thing! 

GEORGE

How's your life? All right? 

WOMAN

Yeah, not bad at all. 

LIPPMAN

(at lectern) And now, uh, ladies and gentlemen of the press, it is my pleasure to introduce you to Mr Jake Jarmel. (he applauds Jake as he vacates the lectern in his favour) 

REPORTER

So Jake, what's your percentage on this book? 

LIPPMAN

Oh, actually I, uh, I have some very interesting information on that. (puts on glasses) You know, uh, this is a co-venture and as... 

JAKE

(notices glasses) Where did you get those? 

LIPPMAN

... as such, it... 

JAKE

Those glasses, where did you get those glasses? 

LIPPMAN

(confused) Where... what? 

JAKE

(to Elaine) Is this supposed to be some kind of a joke on me? Because it's not very funny. (to the nonplussed Lippman) Give me those! (yelling) I want the glasses! Give me those! 

ELAINE

(mouths) 'Scuse me. Have to go (audible) look for some socks. 

JERRY

Look at you. Why don't you use a fork? You're no good with the sticks. 

ELAINE

I know. I need a lesson. 

JERRY

You stink. You know you stink. What is this? 

ELAINE

Oh. My ballet tickets. 

JERRY

Oh. Your ballet tickets. 

ELAINE

Hey, have you ever been to the ballet? 

JERRY

No, but I've seen people on tiptoes. 

ELAINE

You know, I'm going as a beard. 

JERRY

A beard? 

ELAINE

Yeah. This friend of a friend knows this banker guy, he's, I don't know, 30 years, unbelievably gorgeous, of course he's gay. 

JERRY

Yes. 

ELAINE

So anyway his boss has a box at the Met and he invited us to see Swan Lake, which is fine, but he's afraid that his boss can't handle his orientation, so I'm going along as his date. 

JERRY

Why are you doing this? 

ELAINE

Swan Lake, at the Met. 

KRAMER

Oh, Chinese food. I knew I smelled something. 

ELAINE

Hey, is George still wearing that toupee? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

ELAINE

Doesn't he know how ridiculous he looks in that thing? 

KRAMER

I think he looks fantastic. 

ELAINE

Oh, come on. 

KRAMER

No, I never realized what an attractive man he is. 

GEORGE

Hey, people, people, people, people, people. Not bad, huh? Excuse me. 

ELAINE

You look ridiculous in that thing. 

GEORGE

Is that so? Or could it be that you're just a *little* bit worried that you may have missed the boat? 

ELAINE

Well I think they might have sutured that thing to your brain. 

GEORGE

Ha ha ha ha, oh all right, go ahead, deride, deride if you must. But let me tell you something, with my personality and this set of hair, you know what I am now? I am in the game. I no longer defer to the coifed. I'm a player. 

KRAMER

You know I just thought of something. I know this gorgeous woman, she called me up this morning, she's moving into the city, and she asked me if I know of anyone she could meet. Now you can go out with her. 

JERRY

Well what about me? 

KRAMER

No I think he's got you beat buddy. 

GEORGE

So she's gorgeous. 

KRAMER

Oh yeah, last time I saw her she was, five years ago. 

GEORGE

Well have you got a picture? 

KRAMER

No. 

GEORGE

Well, I have to see her. 

KRAMER

Hey, I know what we can do. I've got a friend who works over at the police station. He's a composite artist. 

GEORGE

Really? 

KRAMER

Yeah, yeah, maybe I can get him to draw a picture of her for you. 

GEORGE

Oh I would love that. You think he'd really do it? 

KRAMER

Yeah, yeah. I think he will. 

JERRY

It sounds like an excellent idea. 

KRAMER

Hey Jerry, you want this, cause I'm going to give it to a homeless person. 

GEORGE

Well I'm very excited about this. I've always wanted to see how those sketch artists do it. 

KRAMER

Here you go brother. Some food for you. 

MAN

Thank you. You're a good man. Bless you. 

KRAMER

Now are you going to be here in an hour? 

MAN

Where am I going? 

KRAMER

Oh that's good, that's good. Make the eyes, uh, what's that nut? 

LOU

Almond? 

KRAMER

Almond. Yeah. Make the lips fuller. Poutier. 

GEORGE

Pouty? I like that. 

JERRY

You can't go wrong with pouty. 

GEORGE

I'm excited about the pouty. 

LOU

All right I think that about does it. 

KRAMER

All right George, come on, take a look. 

GEORGE

Oh yeah, you were right. She's gorgeous. 

JERRY

Hey, Lou, who's that woman over there? 

LOU

Oh, that's Sergeant Tierney. Nice officer. You want to meet her? 

GEORGE

Well this worked out okay. So are you going to see the police woman? 

JERRY

Yeah, I think I will. I like the idea of having the law on my side. 

KRAMER

Hey, man. Enjoy the food? 

MAN

Yes I did. Where did the Chinese learn to cook like that? 

KRAMER

Oh, listen, I'll take that Tupperware now. 

MAN

I don't think so. 

KRAMER

Woah, woah, that's mine. 

MAN

You gave it to me. 

KRAMER

No, no, I didn't say you could keep it. You see I don't give away tupperware. 

MAN

You should have said something. 

KRAMER

I didn't think I had to. Look with a piece of Tupperware you just assume. 

ROBERT

I've really got to thank you for this. 

ELAINE

Well by now, you think people would be a little more open minded. 

ROBERT

Really. Would you excuse me? I have to run to the bathroom. 

WIFE

So, um, you and Robert. 

ELAINE

Yes indeed. 

BOSS

I'm surprised. 

ELAINE

Really. Why? 

BOSS

No reason. 

ELAINE

Well believe me this didn't happen overnight. Robert's not exactly a *one* *woman* *man*, if you know what I mean. No sirree Bob. Sure, I mean in a lot of ways, he's a typical guy, he likes his sports, but he counters that side with the side you see here tonight at the ballet, or the pleasure he gets in watching Ms. Liza Minelli belt out a few choice numbers. It's those two halves of his personality that just come together to make him the very special guy that he is. 

ELAINE

Oh, hi honey. 

ELAINE

Oh it was such a great night. 

JERRY

And did they suspect anything? 

ELAINE

No, I was a fantastic beard. I held hands, I called him honey. 

JERRY

And we discover yet another talent. Posing as a girlfriend for homosexuals. 

ELAINE

Oh it was such a great night. Oh. 

JERRY

You said that already. 

ELAINE

Oh I did? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

ELAINE

Oh. 

JERRY

Oh no. Don't tell me. You like him? 

ELAINE

He's incredible. 

JERRY

Yeah, but? 

ELAINE

Yeah, I know. 

JERRY

So? 

ELAINE

What? 

JERRY

Not conversion. You're thinking conversion? 

ELAINE

Well it did occur to me. 

JERRY

You think you can get him to just change teams? He's not going to suddenly switch sides. Forget about it. 

ELAINE

Why? Is it irrevocable? 

JERRY

Because when you join that team it's not a whim. He likes his team. He's set with that team. 

ELAINE

We've got a good team. 

JERRY

Yeah, we do. We do have a good team. 

ELAINE

Why can't he play for us? 

JERRY

They're only comfortable with *their* equipment. 

ELAINE

We just got along *so* great. 

JERRY

Of course you did. Everyone gets along great when there's no possibility of sex. 

ELAINE

No, no, no, I sensed something. I did sense something. I perceived a possibility Jerry. 

JERRY

You realize you're venturing into uncharted waters. 

ELAINE

I realize that. 

JERRY

Are you that desperate? 

ELAINE

Yes I am. 

JERRY

So are you going to bring your gun?... All right, then it's settled. First date, no weapons... All right I'll see you then... Okay, bye. 

JERRY

What are you looking for? 

KRAMER

Tupperware. 

JERRY

Sorry. I don't have any tupperware. 

KRAMER

I knew this was going to happen. I just made a delicious casserole, but now it won't keep because I have no Tupperware. 

JERRY

What about a plastic bag? 

KRAMER

You must be kidding. 

JERRY

What is the difference? 

KRAMER

The patented burp, Jerry. It locks in freshness. 

GEORGE

So I spoke a little to your little friend Denise last night. 

KRAMER

Oh yeah, you talked to her. 

GEORGE

Yeah for two hours. She's nuts about you. 

KRAMER

Yeah well we go way back. 

GEORGE

Why didn't anything happen between you two? 

KRAMER

Who's to say it didn't? 

JERRY

So did you describe yourself to her over the phone? 

GEORGE

Yes I did. 

JERRY

What did you say to her? 

GEORGE

What do you think I said? 

JERRY

I don't know. 

GEORGE

I told her the truth. 

JERRY

As you see it? 

GEORGE

Yes, as I see it. 

JERRY

Did you tell her about, uh, your little hat there? 

GEORGE

What hat? 

JERRY

You know, you're little hair hat there. 

GEORGE

No. 

JERRY

Don't you think she could tell? 

KRAMER

No, no, no she can't tell. It's a perfect match. Beautiful job. 

JERRY

Are you kidding? I could spot that bird's nest two blocks away. 

GEORGE

You only think that because you know me. 

JERRY

Have you noticed people staring at your head? 

GEORGE

I noticed people staring at my head because they like what they see. 

JERRY

Well I think you should either take it off or tell her about it. 

KRAMER

No he's not going to take it off. If he was going to go over there bald, I never would have introduced him. 

GEORGE

Look, I guarantee she won't know. 

KRAMER

Yeah that's it. All right, I'm going to go down to the precinct. I'm going to have lunch with Lou. 

JERRY

Oh, I'll split a cab with you. 

KRAMER

Hey I'm really sorry about the other day. Really sorry. 

MAN

Hey that's my coffee! 

JERRY

Hi Sarge. 

TIERNEY

Hi, I'm sorry I'm late. Some of our lineup decoys didn't show. Hey any of you guys want to be in the lineup? Make a quick 50 bucks? 

KRAMER

Sure. I will. 

TIERNEY

Perfect. Just go over there with officer Lampert. 

SPEAKER

All of you, turn to the left. 

SPEAKER

The left. 

SPEAKER

Now turn to the right. 

GEORGE

(thinking to himself) Oh my god, there she is. That's the face, just like the picture. 

DENISE

George? 

GEORGE

Yeah. Hi. It's great to meet you. 

DENISE

Likewise. Have you been waiting long? 

GEORGE

No, no. I just got here. A few minutes ago. 

DENISE

Good, good. 

GEORGE

Well why don't you take off your hat and stay awhile. 

JERRY

What's that? 

TIERNEY

A polygraph. It's what you civilians call a lie detector test. 

JERRY

Oh. Let me ask you, when someone is lying, is it true that their pants are actually on fire? 

TIERNEY

If I could tell you the famous faces that have been up here. A certain cast member of Melrose Place. 

JERRY

Really. 

TIERNEY

Have you ever seen the show? 

JERRY

No. 

TIERNEY

You can admit it Jerry. It's okay. 

JERRY

I admit it. I don't watch it. 

TIERNEY

Hey Lou, maybe we should put him on the poly. 

JERRY

The poly? 

TIERNEY

Yeah. I think you've seen it. 

ELAINE

Melrose Place? 

JERRY

Yes. Melrose Place. 

ELAINE

I just didn't know you watched that. 

JERRY

Well I do. 

ELAINE

I mean every time I mention it you never say anything or join in the conversation. 

JERRY

Well maybe I was a little embarrassed. 

ELAINE

You mean this whole time we could have been discussing Sydney and Michael and Jane... 

JERRY

And Billy and Jake and Allison, yes we could have discussed it. 

ELAINE

Why? Why were you so embarrassed? 

JERRY

The point is I'm going to be taking this lie detector test and that needle's going to be going wild. 

ELAINE

That is *so* stupid. Why don't you just confess? 

JERRY

It's too stupid to confess. Look at what I'm confessing to. 

ELAINE

So what are you going to do? 

JERRY

I don't know. Maybe I can beat the machine. 

ELAINE

Oh, who do you think you are? Castanza? 

JERRY

Hey you know what? I have access to one of the most deceitful, duplicitous, deceptive minds of our time. Who better to advise me? 

ELAINE

Oh god this tastes terrible. 

JERRY

Did you shake it up? 

ELAINE

No. 

JERRY

You gotta shake it up. 

ELAINE

No. I'm sick of shaking. You've got to shake everything. 

JERRY

Yeah, that's a real nuisance. This is killing me. 

ELAINE

So, I'm going out tonight with Robert and the boss and his wife. 

JERRY

So tonight are you going to make the move? 

ELAINE

Yeah, I think I might. 

JERRY

Hey there he is. So what happened? Could she detect it? 

GEORGE

That's an interesting question. 

JERRY

How so? 

GEORGE

How so? I'll tell you how so. She's bald! 

ELAINE

What do you mean bald? 

GEORGE

What do you think I mean bald? Bald. Bald bald. 

JERRY

She's bald? 

GEORGE

She's bald. 

ELAINE

Oh come on. 

GEORGE

Oh come on? No come on. She took off her hat and there she was (waving his hand over his head) hello. It was like I was looking at myself in the mirror. 

ELAINE

Well maybe she got a haircut or something. 

GEORGE

Let me tell you something. No one walks into a beauty parlor and says 'Give me the Larry Fine.' 

JERRY

Women go bald? 

ELAINE

Yeah, I've heard of that. I mean they usually wear a wig. 

JERRY

Hey. 

KRAMER

Hey. 

GEORGE

You fixed me up with a bald woman. 

KRAMER

Bald? 

GEORGE

Yeah, that's right. 

ELAINE

Do you see the irony here? You're rejecting somebody because they're bald. 

GEORGE

So? 

ELAINE

(puts her hands up to her mouth) You're bald! 

GEORGE

No I'm not. I *was* bald. 

GEORGE

Elaine. 

GEORGE

No, no, no Elaine. 

ELAINE

(shouting) I don't like this thing. And here's what I'm doing with it. 

GEORGE

Nooooo. 

ROBERT

Hahaha, why'd you start that fight with me? 

ELAINE

Well I figured that's what couples do. 

ROBERT

You almost convinced me we were a couple. 

ELAINE

Well it was easy. Really. 

ROBERT

Well good night, I'll call you tomorrow. 

ELAINE

Oh, uh, wait a second. Would you like to come, upstairs? 

ROBERT

Upstairs? 

ELAINE

Yeah. Upstairs? 

ROBERT

Elaine... 

ELAINE

I was hoping you know, that you might be interested in... changing teams? 

ROBERT

Changing teams? 

ELAINE

Have you ever thought about it? 

ROBERT

But I'm a starting shortstop. 

ELAINE

Robert, we need a shortstop. *Real bad*. 

GEORGE

I tell you, when she threw that toupee out the window, it was the best thing that ever happened to me. I feel like my old self again. Totally inadequate, completely insecure, paranoid, neurotic, it's a pleasure. 

JERRY

Good to have you back. 

GEORGE

And you know what else I've decided to do? I'm going to keep seeing the bald woman. 

JERRY

She's as good as anybody else. 

GEORGE

Her scalp was clean. She had a nice skull. There just wasn't a lot of hair on it. 

JERRY

Yeah you've had like a religious awakening. You're like a bald-again. 

GEORGE

Going to need a little more coffee here. 

JERRY

So George, how do I beat this lie detector? 

GEORGE

I'm sorry, Jerry I can't help you. 

JERRY

Come on, you've got the gift. You're the only one that can help me. 

GEORGE

Jerry, I can't. It's like saying to Pavorotti, 'Teach me to sing like you.' 

JERRY

All right, well I've got to go take this test. I can't believe I'm doing this. 

GEORGE

Jerry, just remember. It's not a lie... if you believe it. 

ELAINE

Hey, I did it. 

JERRY

What? 

ELAINE

I turned him. He defected. 

JERRY

Get out! (pushes Elaine) How? How did you do that? 

ELAINE

Because I'm a *woman*. (swiveling her hips) Ba-ba-ba-boom-chicka-boom-chicka-boom-boom- boom. 

JERRY

Elaine, do you know what you've done? You've give hope to every woman who's ever said 'Too bad he's gay'. 

ELAINE

Well it's a lesson for the kids out there. Anything's possible. Jeromy, I have *hit* the jackpot. The perfect man. Nothing but sex and shopping. 

LOU

What's your name? 

JERRY

Jerry Seinfeld. 

LOU

What is your address? 

JERRY

129 West 81st street. 

LOU

Did Kimberly steal Jo's baby? 

JERRY

I don't know. 

LOU

Did Billy sleep with Allison's best friend? 

JERRY

I don't know. 

LOU

Did Jane's finance kidnap Sydney and take her to Las Vegas? And if so, did she enjoy it? 

JERRY

I don't know. 

LOU

Did Jane sleep with Michael again? 

JERRY

(He hesitates) Yes! That stupid idiot. He left her for Kimberly, he slept with her sister. He tricked her into giving him half her business, and then she goes ahead and sleeps with him again. I mean she's crazy. How could she do something like that? Oh that Jane, she makes me so mad. 

JERRY

He went back? What do you mean he went back? 

ELAINE

He went back. 

JERRY

I don't understand it. You were having such a great time, the sex, the shopping. 

ELAINE

Well here's the thing. Being a woman, I only really have access to the, uh... equipment, what, thirty, forty-five minutes a week. And that's on a good week. How can I be expected to have the same expertise as people who *own* this equipment, and have access to it twenty-four hours a day, their entire lives. 

JERRY

You can't. That's why they lose very few players. 

ELAINE

Yeah, I guess I never really stood a chance. 

JERRY

Well there's always a place for you, on our team. 

ELAINE

Yeah. (teary-eyed) Thanks. Is Melrose Place on? 

JERRY

Yeah. It's coming on in a few minutes. 

ELAINE

Okay. 

JERRY

Hey. Don't worry it hasn't started. 

ELAINE

Hey George, I am *really* proud of you. I really do admire what you've done. 

GEORGE

Do you? That makes me so happy. Elaine's proud of me Jerry. 

ELAINE

What is the matter? 

GEORGE

I got rejected by a bald woman. A bald woman rejected me. Heh, you like that one? A woman with no prospects and no *hair*, told me that I wasn't her type. Apparently *baldy* likes a slimmer guy. 

KRAMER

Well I'll tell you what I think. I think she saw you with that piece off and was devastated. You blew it boy. You really blew it. And you had to ruin it for him. Didn't you? 

ELAINE

I didn't ruin anything. He looked like an idiot. He did, and it made him act like a jerk. 

JERRY

All right, shut up, shut up, Melrose Place is coming on. 

JERRY

Oh that Michael, I hate him, he's just so smug. 

KRAMER

Hey, how you doing Stu? Eddie, my man. You again? Boy, you're a slippery one. You'd better straighten up and fly right buddy boy. 

MAN

I've got an eyewitness to that jewelry store break-in. Come here. Do you recognize anybody in the lineup? 

MAN

That's the guy officer. The guy there in the middle. The tall guy with the, with the high hair. I'd recognize him anywhere. 

MAN

Hey you, you with the high hair, step forward. 

KRAMER

Me? 

GEORGE

Say it's Saturday night in Spain. They go out dancing. You think they do the flamenco? 

JERRY

I would think. 

GEORGE

So you could call a woman for a date, ask her if she's free for Dinner and a flamenco? 

JERRY

(scoffs) You don't flamenco on the first date. 

GEORGE

Boy, I wish the flamenco was popular here. 

JERRY

Yeah? Would you do it? 

GEORGE

Yes, I think I would. 

JERRY

Well, I knew you'd have an affinity for it, because it's the dance of a very proud people. 

JERRY

Hello. (listens) Oh, hi Nana. (listens) What? Oh. Oh, alright, okay. Don't worry about it. (listens) Okay, I'll see you later. Alright, bye. 

JERRY

I have to go over to my grandmother's. 

GEORGE

What for? 

JERRY

I have to open a bottle of ketchup for her. 

GEORGE

So, what, no lunch? 

JERRY

No, we have time. 

GEORGE

Oh. How's she doing? 

JERRY

Ah, she's starting to slip a little. Sometimes she has Difficulty distinguishing between the past and the present. 

GEORGE

Ah. You know, there's gotta be an easier way to open ketchups. They should make it in a tube. 

JERRY

Like toothpaste? 

GEORGE

Ya-hah. 

JERRY

There's a squeeze ketchup. 

GEORGE

I've seen squeeze mustard. I've never seen squeeze ketchup. 

JERRY

Well, if they make squeeze mustard, doesn't it stand to reason that they make squeeze ketchup? 

GEORGE

Not necessarily. Mustard lends itself to the squeeze. 

JERRY

I really don't see the difference. 

GEORGE

Oh, there's a difference. It's subtle. 

JERRY

It's subtle. 

GEORGE

Hey uh, isn't Elaine supposed to meet us? 

JERRY

(looking ahead) Yeah, there she is. Uh-oh. 

GEORGE

What? 

JERRY

Ah, she's with her friend Wendy. 

GEORGE

Wendy? Is that the uh, physical therapist? 

JERRY

Yeah. I'm on a kiss hello program with her. 

GEORGE

Really? 

JERRY

Yeah. Every time I see her, I gotta kiss her hello. I just did it once, on her birthday, somehow it mushroomed. Now I dread seeing her because of it. 

ELAINE

(from a distance) Hey. 

GEORGE

You know, I'm down to one kiss hello. My aunt Sylvia. 

JERRY

Ah, that's fortunate. I really admire that. 

GEORGE

(surprise) Huh. I never heard you say you admire me for anything. 

JERRY

No, I told you I admire your hearing. 

JERRY

No, don't slough that off, you have great hearing. 

WENDY

Hey/Hi/Hello (etc.) 

ELAINE

(to Wendy) Wendy, George. (to George) Wendy. 

GEORGE

You're uh, physical therapist, right? 

WENDY

Yes. 

GEORGE

You know, I got this little swelling right here. (rolls up his sleeve to expose his wrist) It's kinda painful. What d'you make of it? 

ELAINE

(warning) George. 

WENDY

Have you tried heat and ice on it? 

GEORGE

(reluctant) Oh that uh, that seems like a lotta trouble. 

WENDY

Well, you could come by my office later, I could work on it for you a little. 

GEORGE

(happy) Oh! Okay. 

WENDY

Let me give you my card. 

GEORGE

Oh, thank you. 

WENDY

Well, I'll see you guys later. (to George) Nice meeting you. Bye Elaine. 

ELAINE

Bye Wendy. I'm sorry. 

WENDY

Bye Jerry. 

JERRY

Bye. 

ELAINE

(slapping George on the arm) What did you do that for? 

GEORGE

What? 

ELAINE

(pinching George's arm) Ask about your arm. 

GEORGE

I still don't see why I can't ask her about my arm. 

ELAINE

She's a physical therapist. She doesn't want to have to deal with that outside of the office. 

GEORGE

Why not? 

ELAINE

Because, it is what she does. 

GEORGE

I love these people, you can't ask 'em questions. (getting excited) They're so mentally gifted that we mustn't disturb the delicate genius unless it's in the confines of an office. (worked up) When huge sums of money are involved, then the delicate genius can be disturbed! 

ELAINE

George, you got a little something, right here. 

GEORGE

(wiping the area with a hand) People think they're so important... 

JERRY

(adamant) Well, I'm going on record right now that that was my last kiss hello. I am getting off the kiss program with her. 

ELAINE

Why? 

JERRY

Well, you know, frankly, outside of a sexual relationship, I don't see the point to it. I'm not thrilled with all the handshaking either, but one step at a time. 

GEORGE

(regarding the menu) What're you getting? 

JERRY

(to Elaine) And what's with that hairdo, by the way? 

ELAINE

Huh, yeah, I know. It's not very flattering. 

JERRY

She looks like something out of an old high school yearbook. You should say something to her. 

ELAINE

Oh, I could never say anything to her about that. 

JERRY

Yeah. Kramer's the only person who could say something like that. 

ELAINE

Yeah. Hah. 

GEORGE

Well, just tell Kramer to tell her. 

ELAINE

No. If you tell him to do it, he'll never do it. 

JERRY

What you have to do is introduce him, and then he'll just come out with it. 

ELAINE

(sharp intake of breath) Hoh. Yes, yes, you're right. That's right. I'll bring her over to meet... 

ELAINE

(to Kramer) ...Kramer. 

KRAMER

Hello, boys and girls. 

JERRY

Speak of the devil. 

KRAMER

Yeah. Hey listen, I uh, I need a picture of you, buddy. 

JERRY

What for? 

KRAMER

Well, I'm uh, I'm putting everybody's picture up in the lobby of our building. 

JERRY

Why? 

KRAMER

So everyone will know everybody's name. See, people are gonna be a lot friendlier. 

JERRY

(reluctant) I, I don't want my picture plastered up in the lobby. 

KRAMER

Imagine walking by someone on the floor, and you say 'Hey, Carl!' and he says 'Hey, Jerry!' You see, that's the kind of society I wanna live in. 

JERRY

(still reluctant) Kramer, I don't wanna stop and talk with everyone, every time I go in the building. I just wanna nod and be on my way. 

KRAMER

(to Elaine) You know your eyeliner's smudged a little. Why do you wear so much eye makeup? 

ELAINE

(to Jerry, indicating Kramer) Yeah. This is gonna work out just fine. 

LEO

Ma! Again with the ketchup? Don't they have 'em in the plastic squeeze containers? 

LEO

(traditional greeting) Jerry! Hello! 

JERRY

Hello, uncle Leo! 

LEO

What're you doing here? 

JERRY

Nana called me to open the ketchup bottle. 

LEO

Yeah, me too. 

NANA

Hello Jerry. 

JERRY

Hi Nana. 

LEO

Aren't you gonna kiss her hello? 

JERRY

Yes. (kisses Nana) Yes of course. 

NANA

Ha, well, here's the bottle. 

LEO

(grabbing the bottle) I'll do it. 

JERRY

(also grabbing) What're you doing, I got it. 

LEO

Give it to me. 

JERRY

Will you stop it. 

LEO

Jerry, will you give me the bottle? 

JERRY

Uncle Leo! (releasing his grip) Alright! Take it! 

NANA

You should let Buddy open it. 

LEO

Buddy? He lived next door to us forty-five years ago. 

NANA

Leo, did you give Helen the fifty dollars? 

LEO

What fifty dollars? 

NANA

Your father won a thousand dollars at the track last week, and he gave you a hundred, and you were supposed to give fifty dollars to your sister. 

LEO

Ma, dad died in nineteen-sixty-two. 

LEO

(laughing off Nana's confusion) Believe me. I don't owe your mother fifty dollars. 

JERRY

I'm just not getting any hot water. 

JULIO

Hey, believe me, I know there's nothing worse than when your shower's not working. I'm gonna take care of it as soon as I can, Jerry. 

JERRY

Thanks, Julio. 

JULIO

Awright. 

JERRY

Huh? 

KRAMER

(surprised) Hey, hey hey hey. Hello! 

JERRY

What's going on here? 

KRAMER

(evasive) Ohh, nothing, nothing. 

JERRY

(suspicious) Well, then what're you doing? 

KRAMER

Oh, I, I need a pen. 

JERRY

What for? 

KRAMER

Well, I'm making out my will. Oh, I got a big slice of dough for you, buddy. And you too, Elaine, I haven't forgotten you. 

JERRY

(accusingly) You're looking for a picture of me, aren't you? 

KRAMER

You got that straight. 

JERRY

I told you, forget it. 

KRAMER

Oh, come on, Jerry. If everybody knew everybody, we wouldn't have the problems we have in the world today. Well, you don't rob somebody, if you know their name! 

JERRY

You're robbing me. 

KRAMER

Well, I'm gonna get your picture, and you're gonna participate in my program. 

ELAINE

Wha... W.. Are you going home? 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

ELAINE

Uh, could you come back in about five minutes? 

KRAMER

Why? 

ELAINE

No reason. (big smile) Just wanna see you again. 

JERRY

(removing his coat) So? Are you sure Wendy's coming? 

ELAINE

Yeah, she'll be here any second. 

JERRY

Well, this'll be a very interesting experiment to see if Kramer says something. You sure you wanna go through with this? 

ELAINE

Listen, Jerry. She never dates, and I know it's because of her hair. 

JERRY

Hello. Oh, hi mom. Yeah, I was at Nana's yesterday. I had to help her open a ketchup bottle. Hey, mom, let me ask you a question. Do you remember when you were a kid, your father winning like a thousand dollars at the track? (listens) Really? Did you know he gave uncle Leo a hundred dollars, and he was supposed to give you fifty? (listens) How do I know? Because Nana doesn't know what year it is, and she thinks this just happened. (listens) Well, I think you should. Okay, bye. 

MORTY

Do you know what the interest on that fifty dollars comes to over fifty-three years? 

HELEN

Oh, Morty, please. 

MORTY

Six hundred and sixty-three dollars and forty-five cents. And that's figuring conservatively at five percent interest, over fifty-three years, compounded quarterly. Or, if you put it into a ten-year T-bill... 

HELEN

Morty, will you stop it! 

MORTY

(determined) Well, he's not getting away with this! 

JERRY

Yeah? 

WENDY

Wendy. 

JERRY

Come on up. 

ELAINE

Well, this is it. Shall I go get Kramer? 

JERRY

No no, he'll come in. Well, this is gonna be my first opportunity to not kiss her hello. 

ELAINE

What is the big deal about putting your lips on somebody's face? 

JERRY

It's the obligation, you know? As soon as this person comes in, you know you have to do this. I mean, if you could, say, touch a breast as part of the kiss hello, then I think I could see the value in it a little better. 

ELAINE

How 'bout an intercourse hello? How would that be? 

JERRY

Elaine, now you're being ridiculous. 

ELAINE

(indicating) That's her. That's her. 

WENDY

Hi/Hey. 

JERRY

(muffled) Hi Wendy. 

WENDY

Oh, hi Jerry. 

JERRY

(muffled) Would you like something to drink? 

WENDY

Sure. 

JERRY

(muffled) There you go. 

WENDY

(taking the bottle) Ah. 

JERRY

Oh, look at that. I'm almost outta Klondike bars. 

JERRY

So, how's everything going? 

WENDY

Oh, okay. Oh, your friend George came by the office the other day, and then yesterday he cancelled on me. 

JERRY

Oh, yeah, he had to take his mother to the chiropodist. 

ELAINE

Oh, you hear that? That must be Kramer. 

KRAMER

Hey! Jerry! 

JERRY

C'mon, that's not fair! 

KRAMER

I told you I was gonna get it. 

JERRY

No, c'mon Kramer. (crossing to Kramer) Gimme that picture. 

KRAMER

(holding the picture away from Jerry) Aagh. No no no no no. 

JERRY

(throws up his hands) Alright, fine. Put my picture up. What do I care? 

ELAINE

Uh, Kramer. Kramer, I'd like you to meet my friend Wendy. 

KRAMER

Oh, hello. 

WENDY

(holds out her hand) Hi. 

KRAMER

(shaking hands) Yeah. 

KRAMER

(points) You know, I really like that hairdo. 

WENDY

(flattered) Oh. Thank you. I actually was thinking it might be time for a change. 

ELAINE

(hopeful) Oh, you were? 

WENDY

Well, I... 

KRAMER

(interrupting) Oh, no no no. You don't wanna do that. No no. Nobody wears it like that. 

ELAINE

Kramer, if she wants to change her hair... 

KRAMER

No, no. you'd be a damn fool to change it. It's very becoming. 

WENDY

Oh, well. 

WENDY

(laughs, flattered) Oh, ho. 

WENDY

So, who's that friend of yours? That guy that came in. 

ELAINE

Oh, Kramer. 

WENDY

Yeah. Does he have a girlfriend? 

ELAINE

You wanna go out with him? 

WENDY

Well, why not? 

ELAINE

Well, it's just that... uh, I don't... 

WENDY

What, is there anything wrong with him? 

WENDY

Elaine? 

ELAINE

I'm just thinking about the question. 

GEORGE

You know, my arm feels a lot better. That Wendy really knows her stuff. (he writes out a cheque) 

RECEPTIONIST

(perky) She is super. Same time tomorrow. 

GEORGE

(tearing out cheque) Yeah, same time. (hands over cheque) There you go. 

RECEPTIONIST

Oh. Ah, you owe a hundred and fifty. 

GEORGE

What for? 

RECEPTIONIST

Well, you cancelled on Tuesday, and our policy is 'twenty-four hours notice, for all cancellations'. 

GEORGE

(agitated) Well, I, I couldn't come. I, I had to drive my mother to, to the chiropodist. 

WENDY

What's the problem? 

GEORGE

(harassed) Are you aware that I'm being charged for Tuesday's appointment? I had to take my mother to the chiropodist. 

WENDY

Well, I'm sorry, that's our policy. 

GEORGE

(after Wendy and to the receptionist) Oh, you have a policy! (to the world at large) The delicate genius has a policy! George heads for the door. 

RECEPTIONIST

So. Will you be here tomorrow? 

GEORGE

Well, it's less than twenty-four hours, so I guess I have to! 

KRAMER

Hey! (indicating photos) So what d'you think? You like it? 

JERRY

Oh my god! Look at that picture, it's terrible... 

JERRY

...You can't put that picture up. 

KRAMER

Well, it's not a beauty contest. It's just a way for people to get to know one another. 

STEVE

Hey Cosmo. 

KRAMER

Hey... 

KRAMER

...Steve. (to Jerry) Ah, you see? 

ELAINE

Hey Kramer, my friend Wendy wants to go out with you. 

KRAMER

(interested) Well, how do you do? 

MARY

Hello, (finds the right photo) Jerry. 

JERRY

Oh. Hello, uh (looks for and finds the photo) Mary. 

MARY

You know, I've seen you so many times and now we can finally talk to each other. 

KRAMER

(keen) What was I telling you? Isn't this nice? 

JERRY

(not really) Yeah. 

MARY

Jerry. You know, could you help me with a package? 

JERRY

Oh, sure, yeah. 

MARY

Thank you. 

JERRY

Oh, no! 

JERRY

You see? That's just what I need. More kissing! 

ELAINE

(laughs) Hee, hee, hee. Hee hee hee... 

JERRY

What is so funny? 

ELAINE

Nothing, nothing. (laughs out loud) 

JERRY

Hello. Oh, hi mom. (listens) What? Oh my... He didn't?! He couldn't! (listens) Alright, I will. (listens) Okay, bye. 

JERRY

(aghast) Uncle Leo put Nana in a home! 

ELAINE

Why? 

JERRY

(suspicious) I don't know. Maybe to keep her quiet. 

JOAN

Hi Jerry. (she kisses Jerry) Mmmwah. 

JERRY

(not as eager) Hi Joan. 

JOAN

How you doing? 

JERRY

Pretty good. 

JOAN

Just pretty good? Not great? 

JERRY

Okay, great. 

JOAN

Are you happy? 

JERRY

Oh, I'm delighted. 

JOAN

Okay. Have a nice day. 

JERRY

You too. 

LOUISE

Hi Jerry. 

JERRY

Hi, Louise. 

KRAMER

Hey. 

JERRY

Ah, well. Thank you very much! 

KRAMER

For what? 

JERRY

(agitated) For putting my picture up on that wall! I'm like Richard Dawson down there now. And every person I see engages me in this long, boring, tedious, conversation. I can't even get out of the building! 

KRAMER

You should be thanking me for liberating you from your world of loneliness and isolation. Now, you're part of a family. 

JERRY

Family? 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

JERRY

You think I want another family? My father's demanding my uncle pay interest on fifty dollars he was supposed to give my mother in nineteen-forty-one, and my uncle put my nana in a home to try and shut her up! And I tell you another thing, Cosmo Kramer, whatever you wanna be called. The kissing thing is over. There's no more kissing, and I don't care what the consequences are. 

RECEPTIONIST

Oh, hi. Mister Costanza, we were trying to get in touch with you. Wendy can't make her appointment. 

GEORGE

What d'you mean? 

RECEPTIONIST

She had some personal affair she had to attend to. I left a message on your machine. You didn't get it? 

GEORGE

When did you leave the message? 

RECEPTIONIST

Few hours ago. 

GEORGE

(pointedly) Oh, I'm sorry, I require twenty-four hours notice for a cancellation. Now, as I see it, you owe me seventy-five dollars. 

RECEPTIONIST

Look, Mister Costanza... 

GEORGE

Will that be cash, or cheque? 

WENDY

I am really glad I took the day off. 

ELAINE

Oh, yeah, there's nothing better than skiing. 

WENDY

Yeah. I hope my clients weren't too upset. 

ELAINE

Ugh, the hell with 'em. 

ELAINE

What're you stopping here for? 

WENDY

I'm dropping you off. 

ELAINE

(pointing) Oh, no, I'm three more blocks. 

WENDY

Yeah, but if I take you to your door, then I have to go all the way around Central Park West, back to Columbus, you know it's all one way... 

ELAINE

Yeah, but it's only three blocks. 

WENDY

Right. It's only three blocks. 

ELAINE

(unbuckling her seatbelt) Alright, well... 

ELAINE

She'd driven me a hundred and twenty miles and, all of a sudden, three blocks from my door, she decides this trip is over. Isn't that strange? 

JERRY

Yes, it's very strange. Very strange. 

ELAINE

I've never heard of anything like this. I mean, it's almost as if I was hitch-hiking and she says 'Well, this is as far as I can take you.' 

JERRY

I tell you. If you were hitch-hiking, you'd never get into a car with someone with a hairdo like that. 

ELAINE

I had to carry my skis, and my boots and my poles. I think I pinched a nerve in my shoulder. 

JERRY

You should have her work on it for you. 

ELAINE

Yeah, alright, I gotta go. 

MAR

Hi Jerry. 

JERRY

Hi Mary. 

JERRY

Uh, listen. I decided I can't kiss hello anymore. I'm sorry. It's nothing personal.... 

JERRY

...It just makes me a little uncomfortable and I can't do it. I'm sorry. 

LOU

Hi Jerry. 

JERRY

Hi Louise... 

JERRY

...I was just telling Mary how I'm not gonna be doing the kiss hello thing anymore. (continues backing away) I'm sorry. I just can't do it. It's nothing personal, it's just I'm not really able to do it and uh, I'm sorry. 

JERRY

(as the elevator doors close) Thank you for your cooperation. 

JERRY

Hello. 

HELEN

Jerry? 

JERRY

Hi mom. So, what's happening with uncle Leo? Is he paying you? 

HELEN

Well, he said no. He said we had no proof. 

MORTY

No proof? We'll get him. He's a crook, sooner or later, he'll slip up. 

HELEN

Uh, anyway, I want you to go check on Nana at the home. 

JERRY

Okay, I will. 

MORTY

D'you realise, an above-average performing growth mutual fund for fifty-three years... 

KRAMER

What's up? 

JERRY

(locking his door) Oh, I gotta go visit my nana in the nursing home. 

KRAMER

Oh. 

JERRY

Hey, Kramer, look at this. 

JERRY

Look at my picture! 

JERRY

I've been defaced! 

KRAMER

Hey, don't you worry buddy. I made double prints. 

JACK

Hey. Hi Cosmo. 

KRAMER

Oh, hey, Jack. How you doing? 

JERRY

Hi Jack. 

JERRY

Hey, Julio. I was wondering, could you get to that shower today, You think? 

JULIO

Oh, I see. When you need something done, you're very friendly to people, huh? 

JERRY

(defensive) No no, that's not true! 

JULIO

(accusing) Well, I think it is! It's a big building, Seinfeld, maybe I'll get to it someday. After I take care of the people who're civil to each other. 

NURSE

Yeah, she's upstairs, playing cards. 

JERRY

You know, she really doesn't belong here. My uncle put her here, Because he's trying to prove he doesn't owe my mother fifty dollars. 

NURSE

Well, she seems very happy. She met an old friend who used to live next door to her. 

JERRY

Buddy? 

NURSE

Yes, that's his name. He's right over there. 

WENDY

(smiling) I'm sorry, I don't owe you anything. I had some personal business that day. 

GEORGE

(irascible) Oh, I see. So your time is more valuable than mine. Is that it? You're a delicate genius! 

WENDY

A delicate genius? 

GEORGE

Elaine? 

ELAINE

(surprised) George! 

GEORGE

(leaving) Hah. Good luck. 

WENDY

What's going on? 

ELAINE

(feeling her arm) Wendy, I injured my shoulder, Wednesday, when you dropped me off and I had to carry my skis, and my boots, and my poles and everything, all the way home. I'm, I'm having trouble lifting my arm. Do you think you could give me some treatment? 

WENDY

Oh sure. You have insurance, right? 

ELAINE

(shocked) Insurance? You're charging me? 

GEORGE

Wednesday? That's your personal business?! (stalks over to the counter) Skiing?! (angry) So let people suffer, while you're shushing all over a mountain? 

WENDY

How did you hear that? 

GEORGE

I hear everything. 

WENDY

I mean, why don't you two just take your business elsewhere, hmm? 

ELAINE

Oh, huh huh, that is a good idea. C'mon George. 

GEORGE

Yeah. Let's go. 

ELAINE

(pointedly) And you know, you might wanna do something about that hair. 

WENDY

Why, what's wrong with my hair? 

ELAINE

Huh, I think it's a little old-fashioned. Don't you? (to receptionist) Uh, tell her. 

RECEPTIONIST

She's right. 

JERRY

So you were with him that day at the track? 

BUDDY

Oh yeah. He won a thousand dollars. His son was there too. 

JERRY

Leo? 

BUDDY

Yeah, that's it. Leo. Ooh, what an obnoxious little kid. He used to steal my soda bottles. and cash 'em in for the deposits, uh? 

JERRY

Is that so? 

BUDDY

And, after your grandfather hit the daily double, he gave him a hundred dollars, and told him to give fifty to his sister. His sister? Why I tell you he shoulda give it to me for all the bottles he took! 

JERRY

Well, that's very interesting. 

JERRY

(standing) Uncle Leo! I just met an old acquaintance of yours. (indicates Buddy) You remember Buddy. He just told me quite a story about you and Grandpa at the track. 

LEO

(defensive) One second... 

JERRY

(with a triumphant point) You're busted! 

JERRY

Hey, Steve. How you doing? 

JERRY

Hey, Jeff. What's happening? 

JERRY

Mary! Oh, Mary! Give us a kiss. 

JERRY

Don't be like that, Mary. C'mon, I made a mistake! 

MARY

(contemptuous) Look, why don't you do everybody a favour, and just get out of this building? (angry) Nobody wants you here. Nobody! 

JEFF

Hi Mary. 

MARY

Hi Jeff. How are you? 

MARY

Hi Pete. How you doing? 

PETE

Hey, let's go get some coffee. 

JEFF

Great idea. 

MARY

Oh, that'd be great. 

JERRY

Oh, Paul, could you hold that door... 

KRAMER

Hi. 

JERRY

Hey. Could I use your shower? 

KRAMER

What, again? You took one this morning. 

JERRY

(pleading) I got a date. C'mon, please. 

KRAMER

I know but I... (waves toward the interior of his apartment) Little problem. 

KRAMER

(leaning to look round Kramer) Wendy here? 

KRAMER

No no no. She changed her hairstyle, (pulls a face) it's terrible. No, we're done. 

GUY

I'll go get some more beer. 

KRAMER

Oh yeah, yeah, great. (calling after the guy) And get some of those blue corn chips. 

KRAMER

Hey. 

STEFANIE

Hi Cosmo. 

KRAMER

Hi. 

STEFANIE

(kisses Kramer hello) Mmmwah. 

KRAMER

Ooh, I like that. 

JERRY

(impressed) Who's that? 

KRAMER

Stefanie. 2-G. 

JERRY

Oh man. Looks like you got quite a few people here. 

KRAMER

Yeah yeah. Well uh, you know, I'd invite you in, but uhm... you know. 

JERRY

(rueful acceptance) Oh, yeah, I understand. 

DOORMAN

Whoah, whoah, whoah. (rises and turns to Jerry) May I help you? 

JERRY

(indicates with his thumb) Yeah, I'm just going up to see Elaine Benes. 

DOORMAN

(unfriendly smile) Benes? (moves toward Jerry) No-one here by that name. 

JERRY

Oh, she's uh, she's house-sitting for Mr. Pitt. 

DOORMAN

Oh. House-sitting, mmm. 

JERRY

Yeah. 

DOORMAN

What're you, the boyfriend? Here for a... quickie? 

JERRY

Can I just go up? 

DOORMAN

Oh, I get it. Why waste time making small talk with the doorman? I should just shut up and do my job, opening the door for you. 

JERRY

How 'bout those Knicks? 

DOORMAN

Oh, I see. On the sports page... 

JERRY

Yeah. 

DOORMAN

...What makes you think I wasn't reading the Wall Street page? Oh, I know, because I'm the uneducated doorman. 

KRAMER

So, you think your parents'll get back together? 

GEORGE

I hope so. I can't take him living with me much longer. He makes this kasha, it stinks up the whole house. 

KRAMER

Hey, George, stick 'em up. 

GEORGE

What? 

KRAMER

For these German tourists. Pretend that I'm robbing you. 

GEORGE

Why? 

KRAMER

So these people can go back home and tell their friends they saw a real New York mugging. It'll give them a thrill. 

KRAMER

Awright, hands up, porky! 

KRAMER

That's it. Now, gimme your wallet. Got it in here, huh, fat boy! 

KRAMER

(aggressive) Is that all you got?! Hah? Is that all you got?! 

GEORGE

Alright, that's enough. 

KRAMER

I'll tell you when it's enough! (he releases George) Alright, now you better not say anything, or I'll stalk you! 

ELAINE

Where've you been? We're gonna miss the movie, let's go. 

JERRY

I am not going back down there. I can't face that guy again. 

ELAINE

What guy? 

JERRY

The doorman. I don't wanna play anymore of his mindgames. What time does he get off? 

ELAINE

Six. But then the night doorman comes on. He's much scarier. (scary noise) Whugh! (laughs) Ha-ha. 

JERRY

Well, it's almost six now. Can't we just wait til he goes home? 

ELAINE

(unhappy) I... 

JERRY

We'll still make the movie. 

ELAINE

(accepting) Okay, okay. 

GEORGE

What'd you do today, dad? 

FRANK

Today, I went record shopping in Greenwich Village. I bought this record, but I can't seem to find the hi-fi. 

GEORGE

I don't have a hi-fi. 

FRANK

Didn't I give you my old record player? 

GEORGE

(leaving to the bedroom) I gave it to Cosmo. 

FRANK

Cosmo? Who's Cosmo? 

KRAMER

I'm Cosmo. 

FRANK

Well, I want it back. I wanna listen to that cha-cha record. 

KRAMER

(little dance) One-two, cha-cha-cha. 

GEORGE

(coming back in) Alright, alright. Can we go out and eat? 

FRANK

(putting down the bowl) Lemme change my shirt. 

ELAINE

Jerry, it's six. (claps her hands) Let's go. 

JERRY

Uh, that doorman's still milling around outside. He's very peculiar. 

ELAINE

No, don't... 

JERRY

(picks up phone) Hello? (listens) Oh, hi Mr. Pitt. 

ELAINE

(quietly) Give that to me. 

ELAINE

(taking the phone) Hello Mr. Pitt. How's Scotland? 

PITT

(concerned) Elaine, are you having a party? 

ELAINE

A party. Oh no, that was just my stupid friend Jerry. 

JERRY

Alright, he just left. We can go. 

PITT

(stern) Because there's to be no entertaining while I'm gone. 

ELAINE

Believe me, we're not entertained. We were just leaving. (to Jerry) Oh, can you grab those empty bottles for me. 

PITT

I need to know what's in the mail. 

ELAINE

Oh, well, Mr. Pitt, there's really nothing that can't wait. We're trying to catch a movie. 

PITT

(resolute) Well, you better catch the later show, because I need to know what's in the mail. 

ELAINE

Alright. (to Jerry, upset) I can't go. 

ELAINE

...Uhm, the new Time magazine. The new People... 

PITT

(piqued interest) Oh, who's on the cover? 

DOORMAN

Hey, buddy. 

JERRY

(surprise) You? Wh...what're you doing here? You work at this building too? 

DOORMAN

Ah, sure. Poor doorman has to work two jobs to put food on the table for mother and baby. (supercilious) No, I live here. That's okay, isn't it? 

JERRY

So you work all day as a doorman at one building. Then you come home and stand outside your own building? 

DOORMAN

You got a problem with that? 

JERRY

Look, I'm not going in your building. I really don't have to talk to you. Goodbye. 

DOORMAN

(calling after Jerry) You really think you're better than me, don't you?! 

GEORGE

My father opened his shirt... 

JERRY

Yeah, and? 

GEORGE

(nods to Kramer) Tell him, Kramer. 

KRAMER

(matter of fact) He had breasts. 

JERRY

What d'you mean, breasts? 

GEORGE

(waves his hands) Big breasts! 

JERRY

So what? A lot of older men have that. 

KRAMER

No, not these. These were real hooters. 

GEORGE

I was throwing up all night. It was like my own personal Crying Game. 

KRAMER

Well, maybe you're gonna get 'em too, George. 

GEORGE

(worried) Yeah, that's right. What if it's a genetic thing, like father like son? 

JERRY

But, your father's not bald. 

GEORGE

No, no no. That skips a generation. The baldness gene comes from your grandfather. 

JERRY

Then I suppose the bosom gene comes from your grandmother. 

KRAMER

You know, Frank can't be too comfortable with those things clanging around. He should wear something for support. 

GEORGE

You mean like a bra? 

KRAMER

A bra is for ladies. I'm talking about a support undergarment specifically designed for men. 

JERRY

Boy, that brain never stops working, does it? 

KRAMER

I tell you, I'm gonna go noodle with this. 

WOMAN

(indicating her shirt with her finger) Hey, we're twins. 

GEORGE

(thinking she means the breasts) What!! 

WOMAN

Our shirts. They're the same. 

GEORGE

Oh, Huh, imagine that. 

ELAINE

(to Jerry) What? What'd you say to the doorman? 

JERRY

What? Nothing. 

ELAINE

(sitting beside Jerry) He claims that you followed him home, and started harassing him. 

JERRY

What has this guy got a personal vendetta with me?! What'd I do to him? 'Cos I asked him about the Knicks? 

ELAINE

Hey, did you make the movie? 

JERRY

No. 

ELAINE

You wanna go tonight? You can pick me up. 

JERRY

Alright. Can we go to a later show, so he's off his shift when I come by? 

ELAINE

Ugh. So now we have to rearrange our lives to avoid the doorman? 

JERRY

Yes, we do. 

ELAINE

What is wrong with George? 

JERRY

He's... trying to get something off his chest. 

GEORGE

(agitated) Alright, I gotta try and talk my mother into taking him off my hands. 

DOORMAN

Help you? 

JERRY

(jumps in surprise) Hoh! What're you doing here? You're supposed to be gone. 

DOORMAN

I traded shifts with the night doorman. He had some personal affairs to attend to. You see, my fellow doorman and I watch out for each other. We don't stab each other in the back, like people in your world. 

JERRY

(trying to ease the tension) Look, I don't want any trouble. I don't have a doorman in my building. I guess I'm just not used to talking to them. I'd really just like to be friends. 

DOORMAN

You wanna be friends? 

JERRY

I'd like to be. 

DOORMAN

Then watch the door for a minute, would you? 

JERRY

What? 

DOORMAN

Yeah, I just wanna run and get a beer. I'll be back in a minute. 

JERRY

Wha...? Wai... wait a second. What do I do? 

DOORMAN

It's not brain surgery. You open the door for people who live here. And, if they don't live here, don't let them in. (takes off his hat) Here. (putting it on Jerry's head) Wear that. 

JERRY

Oh. 

JERRY

(to the man in the elevator) Hey, hey. Wait a second. Hey! Hello! 

JERRY

Hey, hey, wait a second. You live here? 

GREEN

(indignant) Of course I live here. I've lived here for twenty years. Now, if you don't let me in, I'm going to call the police and have you arrested. 

JERRY

(after the guy) You think you're better than me? 

GUY

(indicating) You have to sign for it. 

JERRY

Oh, right. 

GUY

(with a smile) Hey, how 'bout those Knicks, huh? 

JERRY

(dismissive) Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

KRAMER

Hey. I uh, brought back your record player, huh. 

FRANK

Thank you, Kramer. 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

FRANK

(indicating a chair) Put it over there. 

KRAMER

So, how you feeling? 

FRANK

Tired. 

KRAMER

Uh huh. Your back hurt? 

FRANK

How did you know? 

KRAMER

Well, it's obvious, you know. You're carrying a lot of extra baggage up there. 

FRANK

(looks down, and indicates his chest) Up here? 

KRAMER

Oh, yeah. Top floor. (sits beside Frank) Listen, Frank, have you ever considered wearing something for support? Now, look at this. (reaches into his pocket) Mind you, this is just a prototype. 

FRANK

You want me to wear a bra?! 

KRAMER

No, no. A bra is for ladies. 

KRAMER

Meet, the bro. 

ESTELLE

So, is your father excited about coming home? 

ESTELLE

George? 

GEORGE

(broaching a subject) Hey mom. What kind of woman was grandma? 

ESTELLE

All of a sudden you're interested in your grandmother? 

GEORGE

Well, you know. You get to a certain point, you wanna know about your roots. 

ESTELLE

She was a lovely woman. 

GEORGE

Yuh. What about physically? 

ESTELLE

Physically? 

GEORGE

Yeah, you know, what'd she uh, look like? 

ESTELLE

Well, you've seen pictures. 

GEORGE

(to himself) You can't tell much from those pictures. 

ESTELLE

So what? 

GEORGE

Was she uh, was she a big, uh woman? 

ESTELLE

Big? No, just my height. 

GEORGE

Bosomy? 

ESTELLE

Bosomy? You wanna know if your grandmother was bosomy?! 

GEORGE

(trying to laugh it off) No, I was just wondering. The information could be relevant. 

ESTELLE

Where do you get your genes from?! 

GEORGE

(to himself) That's what I'd like to know. 

ELAINE

I can't believe you left your post. 

JERRY

He left me there. You see the mind games? 

ELAINE

(to one of the tenants) Hey, what's up? What's going on here? 

ELAINE

(quietly to Jerry) Jerry, let's get out of here. 

JERRY

Yeah. 

ESTELLE

(shocked) Oh, my god! 

ELAINE

What were you doing watching the door anyway? 

JERRY

He asked me to. We were getting along. 

ELAINE

(thinking) You know, my fingerprints are all over this. That doorman knows you're a friend of mine. He'll tell that co-op lady, she'll tell Mr. Pitt... Jerry, I'm in this too deep. 

JERRY

Don't you find it odd that as soon as he leaves, the couch gets stolen? Maybe he's setting me up! 

ELAINE

(taking command) Alright, shut up. Shut up. Just let me think. I gotta think. We gotta get our story straight. 

JERRY

Alright, well what if we say... 

ELAINE

Alright, (claps hands) here it is. This is what we'll tell 'em. You came to pick me up... 

JERRY

I came to pick you up. 

ELAINE

Yeah. That's what I just said. 

JERRY

I know. I was just... 

ELAINE

Yeah, I know what you were just. It's not helping. 

JERRY

Alright, well. Just, start again, then. 

ELAINE

Okay, you came to pick me up at... 

JERRY

Right. 

ELAINE

You see? Again. 

JERRY

What? I said right. 

ELAINE

Alright, you came right upstairs, without talking to the doorman. 

JERRY

But the doorman's gonna say that I was there. 

ELAINE

(intense) So what? No-one's gonna believe a doorman! 

JERRY

But I don't know if this is gonna work. 

ELAINE

(aggressive, with finger pointing) Just stick with the story. We'll be fine. Let me do the talking! 

JERRY

Okay. 

ELAINE

Good. Now fix me a drink. 

KRAMER

How's that feel? 

FRANK

This feels very comfortable. 

KRAMER

You see? 

FRANK

I feel ten years younger. 

KRAMER

Yeah, and your posture's a lot better. Look at you. 

FRANK

And I can breathe easier, too. 

KRAMER

I told you! Now, Frank, listen. Here's what I'm thinking. Now, you have a friend in the bra business, right? 

FRANK

Of course. Sid Farkus. He's the best in the business. 

KRAMER

(claps his hands) Here's our chance. What d'you say? It'll be me, you and the bro, bro. 

FRANK

Let's do it! 

FRANK

Except, we gotta do something about the name. 

KRAMER

Why, what's wrong with bro? 

FRANK

No, bro's no good. Too ethnic. 

KRAMER

Alright, you got something better? 

FRANK

How 'bout uh... the mansiere? 

KRAMER

Mansiere? 

FRANK

That's right. A brassiere for a man. The mansiere, get it? 

GEORGE

(upset) Well, you've scared her off. We may never see mom again. 

FRANK

Hey George, what d'you like better? The bro, or the mansiere? 

GEORGE

Dad. We need to talk. 

DOORMAN

I had to use the bathroom, so I asked this guy to watch the door for a few minutes. 

PAYTON

Why should I believe you? 

DOORMAN

(indicating Elaine) Actually, it was her friend. 

PAYTON

I was just speaking to the doorman here, about the couch robbery. 

ELAINE

Oh really? (skeptical) The doorman. And, pray tell, what did the doorman say? 

PAYTON

He said he asked a friend of yours to watch the door. 

ELAINE

(dismissive) Oh, my. Well, the doorman certainly has a wild imagination, doesn't he? 

DOORMAN

Well... what do we have here? Perhaps Miss Benes could explain why a Jerry Seinfeld signed for this package (handing the package to Mrs. Payton) at the exact same time the couch was stolen. 

ELAINE

(in a rush) He never watched a door before, Mrs Payton, he didn't know how to do it. (pleading) You know, he's a comedian, Mrs Payton, they don't know how to do anything. 

ELAINE

(desperate) Don't you see what's going on here? He set us up. He's playing all these mindgames. 

JERRY

You're saying I'm responsible for the couch? 

ELAINE

(worked up) There was nothing I could do. He said he had a Federal Express slip with your signature on it. 

JERRY

(livid) Diabolical. He thought of everything. He was setting me up from day one! 

ELAINE

Is it possible we were victims of a sting? 

JERRY

I'm sure he's having a good laugh over this with his doorman buddies. 

DOORMAN

No. I was just messing with his head. 

ELAINE

Anyway, Jerry... Jerry? 

ELAINE

We have to replace the couch. 

JERRY

Now we have to buy a new couch?! 

GEORGE

(crafty) Not necessarily. Why don't you take back the couch you gave me? 

JERRY

The one with the Poppie stain?! 

GEORGE

Yeah, sure. (big smile) Then my father will have no place to sleep. (snaps fingers) He's gotta move out. 

ELAINE

But it's got a pee-stain on it. 

GEORGE

No, the cushion's turned over. 

ELAINE

(not sure) I guess. 

GEORGE

(enthusiastic) Yeah. You get a couch. I get rid of my father. It couldn't be more perfect! 

KRAMER

Now, it's called the bro. 

FRANK

Or, the mansiere. 

KRAMER

Yeah, but I prefer the bro. 

FRANK

I like mansiere. 

FARKUS

Well, I have to tell you, it's a very interesting idea. 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

FARKUS

You know, selling bras exclusively to women, we're really only utilising fifty percent of the market. 

FRANK

(to Kramer) That's what we figured, huh? 

KRAMER

(to Frank) I told you. 

FARKUS

And, to be perfectly frank, I've always felt I could use some support. I know, when I'm wearing Banlon, there appears to be some jiggling. 

FRANK

(vehement) I wouldn't be caught dead in Banlon. 

FARKUS

(indicating the bro) So uh, what d'you see in the back? Hooks? Velcro? What? 

KRAMER

Uh. 

FRANK

Definitely velcro. 

KRAMER

Say you're getting intimate with a woman uh, you don't want her fumbling and struggling back there. 

KRAMER

I think we've all experienced that. 

FARKUS

Summer nights. 

KRAMER

(pointing at Farkus) Very funny. 

FARKUS

Well, I still have to talk about this to Mr. Degrunmont... 

KRAMER

Of course, yes. 

FARKUS

...But, barring any unforeseen developments, gentlemen, I think we're sitting on a winner. 

FARKUS

(sympathy) Frank, I wanna tell you how sorry I am to hear about you and Estelle separating. 

FRANK

Oh, thank you, Sid, but that's all in the past. I'm ready to move on. 

FARKUS

(thoughtful) I've always been very fond of Estelle. Beautiful woman. I uh, I hope you don't think uh, this is out of line, but would it be okay with you, if I were to ask her out? 

FRANK

(anger) You wanna go out with my wife?! (rage) Where do you get the nerve to ask me something like that?! 

FARKUS

Oh, no, Frank, I was just saying... 

FRANK

I know what you're saying, and I know what you're thinking!! 

FARKUS

No, Frank... 

FRANK

C'mon, Cosmo, I'm not doing business with this guy. 

KRAMER

Frank! 

GEORGE

Jerry took the couch back. 

FRANK

He took it back? Didn't you tell him I was using it? 

GEORGE

Oh, I pleaded with him. 

FRANK

Where am I supposed to sleep? 

GEORGE

Well, I took the liberty of packing your things. (gleeful) Mom's coming to get you. 

KRAMER

I thought Jerry didn't want that couch, because of the stain? 

FRANK

What stain? 

KRAMER

Oh, you didn't notice? It has a pee-stain. 

FRANK

(disbelief) You had me sleeping on a pee-stained couch? 

GEORGE

(light) No. No, no, no. The cushion was turned over. 

FRANK

(anger) But, the very idea. you had me lying in urine!! 

GEORGE

Ah! There's mom, there's mom. 

ESTELLE

Is it safe to come in? 

GEORGE

Oh, of course. (motioning Estelle to enter) Of course. 

ESTELLE

You're not having any of your transvestite parties? 

FRANK

Will you stop it? 

ESTELLE

(to Kramer) I lived with him for forty years, I never saw him trying on my underwear. As soon as he leaves the house, he turns into J. Edgar Hoover! 

FRANK

Here, Cosmo... 

KRAMER

Oh, hey. 

FRANK

...You can have the hi-fi. (hands it over) I don't need it now... 

KRAMER

Awright, I got it. 

FRANK

...I got one at home. 

ESTELLE

Alright, let's go. 

FRANK

We'll go out for dinner tonight. 

ESTELLE

I can't tonight, I'm busy. 

FRANK

What d'you mean, busy? 

ESTELLE

I'm having dinner with someone. 

FRANK

With whom? 

ESTELLE

Sid Farkus. 

FRANK

(anger) Sid Farkus?! You're not having dinner with a bra salesman. 

ESTELLE

Hey, he only sells them. He doesn't wear 'em. 

FRANK

Okay, that's it! I'm not coming home! 

GEORGE

(upset) But you can't stay here. There's no place to sleep! 

FRANK

We'll work something out. 

WOMAN

Stop him! Ja, ja, ja, it's him! 

WOMAN

Stop that man! It's him. 

WOMAN

Somebody, stop him! Please, quick. Stop, it's him. I know, I know. Help. Stop him. 

HORST

Hey, hey. (pointing) That record player is not yours. 

KRAMER

Now, look. Somebody gave it to me. 

HORST

You're a thief. We have proof. 

HORST

What is that? 

KRAMER

The first upper-body support undergarment, specifically designed for men. 

HORST

How does it connect in the back? With a hook? 

KRAMER

Oh, no, no. (demonstrates) Here, velcro. 

HORST

(to the portly German) Ooh, (indistinct German) ...keine problem, ah? 

HORST

Is gut, ja? 

PAYTON

Well, I suppose it'll have to do. 

ELAINE

It's a beautiful couch. 

JERRY

It's hardly been used. 

JERRY

Poppie! 

POPPIE

Oh, hello, Jerry. 

JERRY

What're you doing here? 

POPPIE

JERRY

JERRY

'Jimmy' 

GEORGE

'Jimmy, right.' 

JERRY

'I dunno how you could forget . He kept reffering to himself in the third person. 'Jimmy's under the boards. Jimmy's in the open. Jimmy makes the shot.' 

GEORGE

'Ah! your just mad 'cause we beat ya.' 

KRAMER

KRAMER

'Yeah' 

JIMMY

'These are Jimmy's training shoes.' 

GEORGE

'Yeah,yeah yeah yeah! I've seen these.....they sorta ..they make your legs..stronger.' 

JIMMY

'Oh yeah! Jimmy couldn't jump at all before he got these. Jimmy was like you (looks at George) 

KRAMER

'They're Plyometric.(sp?)' 

GEORGE

'Plyometric?' 

KRAMER

'Yeah! They isolate the muscles. The muscle has to grow....or die.' 

GEORGE

(to Jimmy) Wh...Where d'you get'em?' 

JIMMY

'Jimmy sells'em.' 

GEORGE

'You sell them?' 

JIMMY

'Oh yeah! But Jimmy's all out right now. Moving to Manhattan set Jimmy back a bit.' 

GEORGE

'Hey listen, let me give you my card. It's got my home number on it. I want to buy the first pair when the next shipment comes in.' 

JIMMY

'All right' 

GEORGE

'All right Jimmy Good talking to ya.' 

JIMMY

'Jimmy'll see you around.' 

GEORGE

'What day is today?....Aw. ..Tuesday! Damn it. I shouldn't have worked out today. Mr Wilhem has called a big meeting and now I'm gonna be sweating through the whole thing.' 

JERRY

'Why. You took a shower?' 

GEORGE

'Aahhrgh...it wouldn't take...... long pause, audience laughter) ten minutes from now, I'll be sweating all over again ,I can feel it. I'm a human heat pump!' 

KRAMER

'You should take cold showers.' 

GEORGE

'Cold showers? They're for psychotics.' 

KRAMER

'Well I take 'em........They give me a Whooooosh.' 

GEORGE

'All right, I'll see you guys later.' 

JERRY

'Aw right.' 

KRAMER

'So, you're heading home?' 

JERRY

'No...Got dental appointment.' 

KRAMER

'Ah! what.. Tim Whatley? 

JERRY

'Yeah!' 

KRAMER

'Oh yeah.! I got a check up on Thursday.' 

JERRY

'Oh! How d'you like that?' 

KRAMER

'You know.. You really shouldn't brush 24 hours before seeing the dentist.' 

JERRY

'I think that's eat 24 hours before surgery.' 

KRAMER

'Oh no, you got to eat before surgery, you need your strength.' 

WILHELM

'I called this meeting because we......have........a problem. For the last few months someone has been stealing equipment from the club. Until recently it's been little things, y'know; bases, batting helmets, donuts, but two nights ago they pulled the big one. ' 

WILHELM

'They took a pitching machine, a batting cage ,the in-field tarp and all of Mr Steinbrenner's vitamins.. Now , we have reasons to believe it's an inside job.' 

GEORGE

(still puffing)' Whoa!!' 

WILHELM

'If anybody here knows anything about it I recommend strongly that...you come forward.' 

RECEPTIONIST

'Dr Whatley's running a little late. If you'd like to take a seat, I'll call you when he's ready.' 

JERRY

'All right.' 

ELAINE

'Oh! Okay. Right. Thanks Mr Pitt....'kay. ..goodbye.' 

ELAINE

(to Jerry) 'Hey ! You want to go see 'The Velvet Fog'.

ELAINE

'Yeah! Mel Torm&eacute;, That's his nickname.' 

JERRY

'What the hell his a velvet fog.' 

ELAINE

'Do you wanna go or not?' 

JERRY

'Well , where is it?.' 

ELAINE

'He's performing at this AMCA benefit.' 

JERRY

'AMCA?' 

ELAINE

'Able Mentally Challenged Adults' 

JERRY

'Naaaaaa...I can't watch a man sing a song.' 

ELAINE

'What are you..crazy?' 

JERRY

'They get all emotional , they sway. It's embarrassing.' 

ELAINE

'Well, what am I gonna do for a date.?...Oh! do you know that ..hemmm! blond guy who's always at the exercycle at the health club?' 

JERRY

'I don't think so.' 

ELAINE

'Yeah yeah! He's really handsome with those...' 

JERRY

(interrupting) 'Elaine , I really don't...............pay much attention to men`s faces.' 

ELAINE

'You can't find beauty in a man?' 

JERRY

'No... I find them repugnant and unappealing.' 

KRAMER

'Hey!' 

JERRY

(pointing Kramer) 'To wit' 

KRAMER

'What?' 

JERRY

'No ,Elaine and I we're just discussing whether I could admit a man is attractive.' 

KRAMER

' Hmm! Oh! Yeah. I'll tell you who is an attractive man; Gorge Will.' 

JERRY

'Really!' 

KRAMER

'Yeah! He has clean looks, scrubbed and shampooed and....' 

ELAINE

'He's smart....' 

KRAMER

'No, no I don't find him all that bright.' 

KRAMER

'So you got any cavities?' 

JERRY

'Just one....gotta go back.....Oh but get this. Elaine, you will appreciate this. I'm sitting in Tim Whatley's waiting room...He's got a Penthouse right out on the table.' 

ELAINE

'Penthouse?' 

JERRY

'Yeah!!! What is that? I mean isn't that sick. I mean , I'd be embarrassed to have that in my apartment.' 

KRAMER

'So what's wrong with that? 

JERRY

(outraged) He's a doctor!.I mean it's supposed to be like a sterile environment.' 

KRAMER

'So... Did you take a look?' 

JERRY

'Of course.... But that's got nothing to do with it.' 

KRAMER

'Well I'll tell you I'm looking forward to my appointment on Thursday. I might even get there a few minutes early.' 

GEORGE

'Hey' 

ELAINE

'Hey! Hey! listen ... Do one of you guys know that ..that blond guy who's always on the exercycle at the health club. You know he's just really handsome?..' 

GEORGE

(head down low) I...I wouldn't know' 

ELAINE

'You know that just admitting a man is handsome doesn't necessarily make you a homosexual.' 

GEORGE

'It doesn't help' 

ELAINE

'All right, I'm gone' 

GEORGE

'I'll see you.' 

GEORGE

(to Jerry) 'You know those shoes that Jimmy had? I cut a deal with him. We're gonna import a case of them together.' 

JERRY

'What are you doing that for, you got a job' 

GEORGE

'There's a lot of money in this.. He's got a proven sales method' 

JERRY

' Yeah! What's that.' 

GEORGE

'He jumps!' 

JERRY

'Jimmy's got a record. Jimmy's jumping for dollars. Jimmt and George are gonna get rich.' 

GEORGE

'Will you stop with the Jimmies' 

KRAMER

'Hey! What's this?'

JIMMY

'You know...Jimmy is pretty sweet on you.' 

ELAINE

'Aaaaaahhh! He is?!' 

JIMMY

'Oh yeah!. Jimmy's been watching you....you're just Jimmy's type.' 

ELAINE

'AAaaaaahhh! Really?'(giggles) 

JIMMY

'Jimmy's new in town. Jimmy hem ..doesn't really know anyone.' 

ELAINE

'Oh! well I'd like, like to get to know him.'

KRAMER

'Well you know its.. great. You know, no kids ..allowed. you don't have to watch your language.' 

JERRY

'You find you need to use a lot of obscenities at the dentist. 

KRAMER

'He..he... When they pull that needle out I let the expletives fly.' 

JERRY

'Hey! Hey! Watch it.!... You're drooling all over the floor. How much Novocaine did that guy give you.'

GEORGE

(angrily)'WHY WEREN'T YOU MORE CAREFUL WITH YOUR DROOL!' 

KRAMER

'HEY I'M DOING THE BEST I CAN!!!' 

JERRY

'Why are you taking this so personally?' 

GEORGE

'BECAUSE IF HE CAN'T JUMP. THERE GOES MY SNEAKER BUSINESS!!'

JIMMY

KRAMER

'BUT I CAN'T FEEL ANYTHING.'

ELAINE

'What you do!!. You don't do anything.' 

KRAMER

'Well apparently I do something 'cause I'm sitting at the head table with Mr. Mel Torm&eacute; 

ELAINE

KRAMER

'Ehmm ..These are my vertical leap training shoes.'

'No!...not...nothing.' 

WILHELM

'George, there's nothing I hate more than a liar.' 

GEORGE

'Well...there's no room for someone like that in this organization.' 

WILHELM

'Are you feeling all right George?' 

GEORGE

'Hemmm!.. Fine!' 

WILHELM

'You look a little warm.' 

GEORGE

'...It's the chicken' 

WILHELM

'You're a terrible liar George. Look at you, you're a wreck!. you're sweating bullets.' 

GEORGE

'It's the Kom Pau ... George likes his chicken spicy.' 

ELAINE

'....Maybe you were still under the gas.Maybe you were hallucinating you're coming out of the gas but you were still under the gas.' 

JERRY

'I don't think so. I think they were getting dressed and not only that; my shirt was out!!!' 

ELAINE

'your shirt was out?' 

JERRY

'I think so.' 

ELAINE

'Well, what kind of shirt was it.?' 

JERRY

'You know! Like a tennis shirt.' 

ELAINE

'Oh! Well ... You don't tuck those in?' 

JERRY

'Sometimes I tuck'em sometimes I don't' 

ELAINE

'Well. Were you tucked?' 

JERRY

'I think I was tucked.!'

As an avid reader I've always wondered if the letters (with Jerry) are I'm a dentist and one afternoon my hygienist and I decided to have a little fun with one of our patients. Of course none of our patients had any idea exactly of what we were up to. I was still wondering what if ......... (Jerry stops and seems bewildered) 

GEORGE

Jerry it's funny, Paula and I actually met because of Elaine.  

PAULA

GEORGE

..And I went down there one time to see...  

JERRY

(cuts in) A nude model.  

GEORGE

If Elaine wanted to get some coffee.  

JERRY

You know I went out once with a nude model. Never let me see her naked. Hundreds of people see her naked every week, except me. Needless to say it was quite vexing.  

GEORGE

Are you through?  

JERRY

Yeah!  

GEORGE

So Anyway, I started to compliment Elaine on her sketches and it turns out,they're Paula's.  

PAULA

George, I just like to doodle  

GEORGE

GEORGE

Well I've done that.  

JERRY

Yeah, but with you it's intentional.  

GEORGE

Haven't you kissed her?  

JERRY

Yeah, but this is different , this is like ,you know, semi digested food stuff. You know the next stop is the stomach and you can take it from there.  

GEORGE

Excuse me just for a second. ( fixes his hair looking at his reflection in a coffee pot.)  

JERRY

AH. Yes that's gonna make a big difference.  

GEORGE

KARL

I don't explain 'em Mr. Seinfeld. I just exterminate them.  

JERRY

I don't understand this..  

KARL

I 'm gonna have to seal the place up for 48 hours and fog it. That's the only way to get rid of them.  

JERRY

Nobody can be in here for 48 hours, I got my parents in town.  

KARL

Well , unless you want to kill them. They can't stay in here. This stuff is pretty toxic. I'll go get my stuff, it's in the truck.

JERRY

I don't know...But every one's got to clear out of the apartment for two days. I don't know what I'm gonna do with my parents. they'll never let me pay for a hotel and if they go to someplace on their own I'm sure it's gonna be some awful dump. Wait a second.. Have you checked in The Plaza yet?

JERRY

GEORGE

She said looks aren't important to her?  

ELAINE

Well..hum...let me rephrase that, She said....  

GEORGE

She thinks I'm ugly. I knew it.  

JERRY

You see the thing of it is, there's a lot of ugly people out there walking around, but they don't know they're ugly, because nobody actually tells them.  

GEORGE

.....So what's your point?  

JERRY

I dunno...  

ELAINE

Okay.. The point , George, is she likes you.  

GEORGE

Oh!, so what. I'd rather she hate me and thought I was good looking....At least I can get somebody else. (scratching his chest) What is this? Why am I itching?  

JERRY

That'd be the fleas.  

JERRY

KRAMER

Toxic gas!!!  

JERRY

Aw! You'll be fine, you were in there for what , a couple of minutes.

KRAMER

JERRY

JERRY

Wait a minute . Did you say chunky wrappers?  

ELAINE

JERRY

JERRY

NEWMAN

JERRY

There's nothing pleasant about it, so lets just cut the crap.. You gave me fleas. I know it and you know it..  

NEWMAN

Fleas? Bwa ha ha ha ha .That's preposterous. How can I , give you fleas. Now if you don't mind...  

JERRY

Oh! but I do. There's probably fleas crawling all over your little snack bar. ( as he says this Newman is wildly scratching behind his back. he suddenly stops when Jerry turns around)  

NEWMAN

So , you have fleas. Maybe you keep your house in a state of disrepair. Maybe you live in squalor. 

JERRY

You know Newman , the thing about fleas is that they irritate the skin and they start to...itch. Oh! maybe you can hold out five seconds or ten, maybe fifteen or twenty but after a while, no matter how much will power a person may have. It won't matter, because they're crawling , crawling on your skin. Up your legs , up your spine , up your back.....  

NEWMAN

(Cannot take this torture anymore) Baaaaaaaaarrhhhhhhhhhhh....I'm ripped with fleas ( scratches furiously)  

MORTY

Oh! Oh! That feels good. Hey! This guy charges a hundred bucks an hour but I'm telling ya he's worth every penny OOOOHH!

GEORGE

Well I spoke to Elaine...  

PAULA

Hey! Look , no shave.  

GEORGE

No...Why should that make any difference to you?  

PAULA

It doesn't..  

GEORGE

Of course not. You don't care what I look like.  

PAULA

That's right I don't.  

GEORGE

I suppose I could just pull this out ( his tucked shirt)and walk around like this and you wouldn't care?  

PAULA

Not a wit.  

GEORGE

Hu humm? i suppose we could go to Lincoln Center and I'd be wearing sneakers and jeans and that would be fine too.  

PAULA

You can wear sweatpants.  

GEORGE

I could..  

PAULA

(seductively) You could drape yourself in velvet, for all I care.  

GEORGE

Velvet...  

ELAINE

Did you read the whole thing?  

KRAMER

Oh! yeah.  

ELAINE

Huh . So What's it about?  

KRAMER

Well it's a story about love, deception, greed, lust and...unbridled enthusiasm.  

ELAINE

unbridled enthusiasm...?  

KRAMER

Well , that's what led to Billy Mumphrey's downfall.  

ELAINE

Oh! boy.  

KRAMER

You see Elaine, Billy was a simple country boy. You might say a cockeyed optimist, who got himself mixed up in the high stakes game of world diplomacy and international intrigue.  

ELAINE

Oh! my God.  

KRAMER

ah! Here we go.  

ELAINE

(to the waitress) can I have a scotch on the rocks.

ELAINE

JERRY

Hey, thanks a lot for lettin' me stay here.  

SHELLY

Well, I don't keep pecans in the house so I didn't think it'd be a problem.  

JERRY

( embarrassed laugh) ...Oh! Damn..  

SHELLY

What's the matter?  

JERRY

I forgot my toothbrush.  

SHELLY

Oh! no problem.....You can use mine.  

JERRY

Yours?....You know what I'll think I'll brush later.  

SHELLY

Brush now.  

JERRY

(long pause).......Sure. ( humms a song then stares at the toothbrush)  

KRAMER

NEWMAN

KRAMER

Come on ,c'mon i need to taste it. ( takes his peach).....Nothin' , Can't even taste a Macanaw.  

NEWMAN

KRAMER

Waited all year and I can't even taste it..  

NEWMAN

You can't taste 'em . Why waste 'em . Why not give them all to me.  

ELAINE

It's a story about love , deception ,greed , lust and.... unbridled enthusiasm .  

MANDEL

Unbridled enthusiasm.  

ELAINE

Yeah!..tha..that's right. that That's what led to...(throath clearing) Billy Mumphrey's downfall.  

MANDEL

hmmm...interesting take. So you believe, has he not been so enthusiastic he could have adverted disaster.  

ELAINE

Yes...Ye..Yes..That's right...You see ,Billy Mumphrey was a simple country boy. Some might say a cockeyed optimist, who got caught up in the dirty game of world diplomacy and International intrigue.  

MANDEL

So.. It was more a question of attitude than politics..  

ELAINE

Yes, yes Mr. Mandel.  

MORTY

Hey! Under Siege is on again. Whose up for it?  

LEO

No more nuts. Awrghh.....  

JERRY

Oh! my god. What the hell is this? ..... Don't tell me.......Velvet!!!

JERRY

She's seen you in this thing.  

GEORGE

JERRY

GEORGE

He he...So huh! What's with the suitcase.  

JERRY

GEORGE

JERRY

GEORGE

JERRY

Well I guess I'm stuck with the Velvet Fog.  

MANDEL

Three hours of massage time , twelve in-room movies including several adult features, five shoe shines and four hundred dolars worth of snacks. Not to mention the damage to the room.  

ELAINE

Mr Mandel, you don't understand ...my my friend had fleas. I ran into the gas, it could have killed me, and my, my other friend couldn't taste his peaches ,they only good for two weeks.  

MANDEL

I think , you've read, one too many, Billy Mumphrey stories. Good day Miss Benes.  

ELAINE

Okay...Good day..  

PAULA

Hi George.  

GEORGE

( mouth full) Hi, this is fantastic ( puts the pit in the a plate)D'you ever had a Macanaw peach?  

PAULA

Oh! yeah I love those.  

GEORGE

Too bad , it's all done.  

KRAMER

ya....Yes!....Yes! it's back I can taste again. ( to a passerby) Hey! What's the date today?  

PASSERBY

The fifteenth.  

KRAMER

Fifteenth , Yes last day for the Macanaws. I can still make it. Wait.. Newman...  

NEWMAN

Sorry , last one . Would you want to suck the pit?  

KRAMER

( fake laugh ) Look Hubert. It's the mailman. You remember the mailman don't you.  

ELAINE

( knocks) Hello is anybody here?..  

LEO

They said they were sending an Asian woman.  

ELAINE

Oh! my God.  

JERRY

I hear you're going out with David Putty. 

ELAINE

Yeah. What, is it a problem? 

JERRY

Well, I think he could've asked me. Supposed to be a friend of mine. 

ELAINE

Well, I guess he figured you just wouldn't care. It *has* been a few years. 

JERRY

Elaine, you always care who an ex-girlfriend dates. You don't want it to be someone you know, and you don't want it to be someone better than you. Now, even though the latter is *obviously* impossible. 

ELAINE

Oh, god. 

JERRY

The former still applies. I don't know what it is, but I just can't see you with a mechanic. 

ELAINE

Oh, yeah. Right, right. Well, all those mechanics do is work all day with their hands and their *big*, *muscular* arms on machines, and then they come home dripping with animal sexuality like Stanley Kowalski. What a huge turn-off that is. 

JERRY

All right. 

GEORGE

Look at that. They got lobster on the menu. Who would order a lobster here. I mean, do they bring a lobster in everyday hoping *todays* the day. 

ESTELLE

So what if they have a lobster. Suddenly you're a shell-fish connoisseur. 

GEORGE

You know, I think we really need to be in front of a television set. You take T.V. out of this relationship, it is *just* torture. 

ESTELLE

So, I'm getting an eye job. 

GEORGE

An eye job? Ma, you don't need an eye job. 

ESTELLE

Georgie, I'm a divorcee. 

GEORGE

No, you're not a divorcee. You&yuml;re just separated. You're---you're a separatee. 

ESTELLE

Well, I'm out there, George. 

GEORGE

No, you're not out there. 

ESTELLE

I am, too! 

GEORGE

You're not out there! You can't be, because *I* am out there. And if I see *you* out there, there's not enough voltage in this world to electroshock me back into coherence! 

ESTELLE

Well, anyway, the operation is on Tuesday and I need you to drive me home because I'll be all drugged up. 

GEORGE

Tuesday? I can't do it Tuesday. Steinbrenner needs me to run--- 

ESTELLE

This is the only time the doctor *has*. 

GEORGE

Kramer, hey, hey! (Gets up out of his seat) 

KRAMER

Hi, little buddy. 

GEORGE

Come on over and sit down. 

KRAMER

Hey, listen, I gotta go somewhere. 

GEORGE

No, you're gonna sit down, you son of a gun... 

KRAMER

All right, I'm sitting down. How are you? (Kisses Estelle on the cheek) 

ESTELLE

So, Kramer. I'm getting an eye job. 

KRAMER

Oh, yeah, good for you. Hey, you have to look your best. You're out there now. 

GEORGE

She's not out there! 

KRAMER

So, who is your doctor? 

ESTELLE

Uh, Bakersoll. 

KRAMER

(whistles). He's good. He's *very* good. He worked on this kid from Guatemala with no nose. Turned him into Ricardo Montalban. 

GEORGE

Hey, Kramer, what are you doing Tuesday? 

KRAMER

Tuesday? Uh... 

GEORGE

Why doesn't *he* pick you up after the operation. He's got the car with the bench seats that you like. 

ESTELLE

Oh, I don't care. 

KRAMER

Yeah, I know, but I can't drive anybody anywhere until I go down to the motor vehicle bureau and get my new plates. 

GEORGE

Well, giddy-up! 

KRAMER

Yeah, I'm here to pick up my new plates. My name is Kramer. Cosmo Kramer. 

CLERK

Kramer.... (checks computer) All right... 

KRAMER

All righty... 

CLERK

Sign right here, please. (hands over clipboard) 

KRAMER

(signs it) Okay. (The clerk hands him a manila envelope). Thanks. (opens up the envelope) Assman? Oh, no, these don't belong to me. I'm not the Assman. I think there's been a mistake. 

CLERK

What's your name again? 

KRAMER

Cosmo Kramer. 

CLERK

(checks computer again) Cosmo Kramer. You *are* the Assman. 

KRAMER

No! I'm not the Assman. 

CLERK

Well, as far as the state of New York is concerned, you are. 

DAVID

How do you feel? 

ELAINE

Fine. 

DAVID

Something the matter? 

ELAINE

No. 

DAVID

Then what is it? 

ELAINE

No, nothing. 

JERRY

Hi. 

ELAINE

I was with David *Putty* last night. 

JERRY

Yeah, so. 

ELAINE

He did the move. 

JERRY

What move? 

ELAINE

You know...*the* move. 

JERRY

Wait a second. *My* move? 

JERRY

David Putty used *my* move? 

ELAINE

Yes, yes. 

JERRY

Are you sure? 

ELAINE

Jerry! There is no confusing *that* move with any other move. 

JERRY

I can't believe it. He *stole* my move. 

ELAINE

What else did you tell (reaches over to slap Jerry) him. (does it again) The two of you must have had *quite* a little chat! 

JERRY

Oh, it wasn't like that! I didn't even mention you. You know, we were in the garage. You know how garages are. They're conducive to sex talk. It's a high-testosterone area. 

ELAINE

Because of all the pistons and the lube jobs? 

JERRY

Well, I'm going down to that garage and telling him to stop doing it. 

ELAINE

Well, wait---wait a second. 

JERRY

What? 

ELAINE

Isn't that a little...rash? 

JERRY

No! He stole my move! 

ELAINE

Yeah, but...*I* like the move. 

JERRY

Yeah, but it's like another comedian stealing my material. 

ELAINE

Well, he doesn't even do it exactly the same. He--he--he uses a pinch at the end instead of the *swirl*! 

JERRY

Oh, yeah. The pinch. *I've* done the pinch. That's not new. Besides which, I don't know how you could trust any of his moves now. His whole *repertoire* could be lifted. 

ELAINE

You know, it's strange, because he's such an honest mechanic. 

JERRY

I know, he's probably the only honest mechanic in New York. 

JERRY

...so he stole my move and he's using it on Elaine. 

GEORGE

You told David Putty your move and you didn't tell *me*? I *need* a move. You know I have no moves, Jerry. (points to the candy bar) Gimme a bite. 

JERRY

Can I just get it opened first? 

GEORGE

I can't believe you're hoarding sex moves. I'm out there rubbing two sticks together. You walk around with a zippo. 

JERRY

All right, all right. Here. (hands George a piece of the candy bar). 

GEORGE

(takes a bite) Oh, that's good. That's very good. 

JERRY

You feel better? 

GEORGE

Yeah, much better. All right, so what's the move, because I need *something*. This woman I'm dating, it's like she's doing her nails during love-making. 

JERRY

Nancy Klopper? 

GEORGE

Yeah. Never seen anyone so bored. I'm working like a dog here. Give me a moan. *Something*. I'd settle for a belch, for god's sake. All right, come on, let's have it. 

JERRY

All right, George. I'm gonna tell you. But I just wanna make sure, before--- 

GEORGE

Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's in the vault. I'm putting it in the vault. 

JERRY

It's not even a question of that. The point is when something like this is passed along, one must be certain that it's going to be used in a *conscientious* way. This is not some parlor trick to be used--- 

GEORGE

You're gonna tell me...or not. 

JERRY

All right. On your bed. You got a headboard? You'll need a headboard. 

GEORGE

I got a headboard. 

JERRY

Is it padded? 

GEORGE

No. 

JERRY

Good. How tall is she? 

GEORGE

Five-foot four. Why? 

JERRY

You can't have more than a one-foot differential in your heights. Otherwise, you could really hurt your neck. 

GEORGE

I can't tell ya how much I appreciate this. 

JERRY

George, if you could master this, you'll never be alone again. 

JERRY

Now, the ending is kind of an option. I use the swirl. I like the swirl. I'm comfortable with the swirl. *I* feel the swirl is a great capper. He uses the pinch, which I find a little presumptuous. 

GEORGE

Is it a clockwise swirl? 

JERRY

I prefer clockwise, but it's not written in stone. 

KRAMER

Here you go, buddy. (shows it to Jerry). 

JERRY

What is it? 

KRAMER

*Fusilli* Jerry! It's made from Fusilli pasta. See the microphone? 

JERRY

When did you do this? 

KRAMER

In my spare time. (turns to George). You know, I'm working on one of you, George. I'm using ravioli. See, the hard part is to find a pasta that captures the individual. 

JERRY

Oh... Why Fusilli? 

KRAMER

Because *you're* silly. Get it? (hands the Fusilli to Jerry) Yeah... 

JERRY

Well, thank you very much. 

GEORGE

So, did you get your new plates? 

KRAMER

Oh...yeah. I got my new plates. But they mixed them up. Somebody got mine and I got their *vanity* plates. 

GEORGE

What do they say? 

KRAMER

Assman. 

JERRY

Assman? 

KRAMER

Yeah. Assman, Jerry. I'm Cosmo Kramer, the Assman! 

JERRY

Who would order a license plate that says 'Assman'? 

GEORGE

Maybe they're Wilt Chamberlain's. 

JERRY

It doesn't have to be someone who gets a lot of women. It could be just some guy with a big ass. 

KRAMER

Yeah, or it could be a proctologist. 

JERRY

Yeah. Proctologist. 

GEORGE

Come on! No doctor would put that on his car. 

KRAMER

Have you ever *met* a proctologist? Well, they usually have a very good sense of humor. You meet a proctologist at a party, don't walk away. *Plant* yourself there, because you will hear the funniest stories you've ever heard. See, no one wants to admit to them that they *stuck* something up there. Never! It's always an accident. Every proctologist story ends in the same way: 'It was a million to one shot, Doc. Million to one.' 

KRAMER

Oh! There's my phone. (He leaves) 

GEORGE

So, where you gonna stick this (points to the Fusilli Jerry) 

JERRY

I'll tell you where I'd like to stick it. 

JERRY

Hey, David. 

DAVID

Oh, hi, Jerry. 

JERRY

Hey, what's the story? I hear you're doing my move. 

DAVID

What move? 

JERRY

What move? *My* move. The one I told you about. You used it on Elaine. 

DAVID

You're move? What, are you kidding? I was doing that before I knew you. All you told me about was the ending. 

JERRY

The ending is the whole thing. Without the ending, it's nothing. You had *nothing*. 

DAVID

Oh, that ending was *so* obvious. I would have figured it out anyway. I didn't need you to tell me that stupid twist. 

JERRY

Swirl. 

DAVID

Whatever. I don't even do it. 

JERRY

Oh, yeah, I know. You do the *pinch*. 

DAVID

Yeah, that's right. 

JERRY

You can't come up with your own stuff , so you *steal* other peoples? You're nothing but a hack. 

DAVID

Are you through, 'cuz, uh, I gotta get back to work. 

JERRY

Well, I'll tell you what I'll do, you know. If you wanna do it out of town...okay. But not in the city. 

DAVID

All right, how about the next time your car breaks down, you take *that* out of town. 

JERRY

Fine. 

DAVID

Good! 

NANCY

Ow, George! (crawls out from beneath the covers) What are you doing? 

GEORGE

(pops his head out of the covers, looking a bit confused) Uh...you know, uh...pleasuring you. 

NANCY

Well, stop it! 

GEORGE

You don't like the move? 

NANCY

No. I don't. 

GEORGE

You're kidding. 

NANCY

No, I'm not. It feels like aliens poking at my body. 

GEORGE

Sorry. I'll just go back to my usual routine. 

ELAINE

Oh, god! Oh, god, Dave! Oh, yes! Yes! 

DAVID

No, I'm sorry. 

ELAINE

What?!! 

DAVID

I can't do the move. 

ELAINE

What? 

DAVID

Oh, he's ruined it for me. 

ELAINE

Oh, oh, come on, please? 

DAVID

No, he called me a hack. I'm just not into doing it anymore. 

ELAINE

Oh, so---so that's it? 

DAVID

I'll come up with some new stuff. 

KRAMER

'Call me. Thirty-six, twenty-four, forty-six. I think I have what you're looking for.' (Pleased by the note, Kramer stumbles into his car). 

BAKERSOLL

I must caution you about one thing. You can't cry for at least ten day. You can ruin the operation. 

ESTELLE

Oh, okay. 

BAKERSOLL

Now, is someone coming to pick you up? 

ESTELLE

Yes, my son's friend should be here any minute. 

GUARD

Can I help you? 

KRAMER

Ah, yeah. Doctor Cosmo Kramer. (points to plate) Proctology. 

GUARD

Oh, oh, okay. Sure... 

KRAMER

Thanks. Have a good day. 

KRAMER

I just can't get over how fantastic you look. 

ESTELLE

Oh, really? 

KRAMER

Oh, yeah. This takes twenty years off. 

ESTELLE

And it was all done by laser. I don't even need bandages. 

ESTELLE

Did he say 'Assman'? 

KRAMER

Oh, yeah. 

ESTELLE

Oh my goodness. 

KRAMER

You got that straight! 

ESTELLE

Boy. I never dreamed it could make such a difference. 

JERRY

You must have done *something* wrong. You probably screwed up the order. Did you close with the swirl? 

GEORGE

Supposed to close with the swirl? 

JERRY

Oh my god. Yes, you close with the swirl. There's a progression there. I told you to write it down. 

GEORGE

Yeah, yeah, should've written it down. 

JERRY

Yeah? 

BUZZER

Elaine. 

JERRY

C'mon up. (turns to George) You know what? Do me a favor. Don't even do the move anymore. You're gonna give it a bad name. 

JERRY

Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. What? Twenty-eight hundred dollars?!! That's the estimate on my car?!! No, don't even do anything. I'm gonna think about it. Okay, bye. 

GEORGE

What's to think about? If Putty says it's what it is, it's what it is. He's not gonna cheat you. 

JERRY

Except that it's not Putty. 

GEORGE

What happened to Putty? 

JERRY

Eh, we had a little fight about the move. I took her to this other place. I think they might be trying to screw me. 

GEORGE

Well, of course they're trying to screw you. What do you think? That's what they do. They can make up anything. Nobody knows. 'By the way, you need a new Johnson rod in there.' 'Oh, a Johnson rod. Yeah, well, you better put one of those on.' 

JERRY

Hey, Elaine. 

ELAINE

Yeah, yeah, hello. 

JERRY

Is it something I said? 

ELAINE

Yes! As a matter of fact! David Putty won't do the move anymore. 

JERRY

Really? 

ELAINE

Oh, he's come up with some other move. You should see this thing. 

JERRY

What is it? 

ELAINE

Oh, it's a lot of just fancy-shmancy stuff. You know what it's like? It's like a big budget movie with a story that goes *nowhere*. 

JERRY

Huh. 

ELAINE

I mean, this move is no good, Jerry. It's just taking up a lot of my time. And I...will not stand by and allow him to perform this move on me, when a perfectly good move is just sitting in the barn doing nothing! 

GEORGE

Let me ask you a question. This new move. Is there a knuckle involved in any way? 

ELAINE

Yes. As a matter of fact, there is. 

GEORGE

I think that's mine. 

ELAINE

I'm not surprised. 

JERRY

Listen. I need you to do me a favor. When's the next time you're gonna see him? 

ELAINE

Why? 

JERRY

You gotta get an estimate on my car from him. I think this garage is trying to screw me. 

ELAINE

An estimate? How am I supposed to do that? 

JERRY

Well, look. Here's the work order with everything that broke. Just kind of bring it up at the right time and find out. (hands Elaine the work order) 

ELAINE

(takes the work order and points to the Fusilli Jerry sitting on the table) What? What is this? 

JERRY

That's, uh, Fusilli Jerry. 

ELAINE

Fusilli Jerry? 

JERRY

Yeah. Kramer made it. 

GEORGE

All right, listen, I'll see you guys later. 

JERRY

Hey, Assman! 

KRAMER

Hey, well, this is Sally. 

SALLY

Hello. 

JERRY

Hi. 

ELAINE

Hi. 

KRAMER

Shall we go? 

SALLY

Okay. (turns around and walks out with an exaggerated swing of her hips) 

ESTELLE

You can't face the fact that I'm improving myself. 

FRANK

You're not the only one improving yourself. I worked out with a dumbbell yesterday. I feel *vigorous*. 

ESTELLE

Just take your mail and go home. I have things to do. 

FRANK

I got things to do, too. 

ESTELLE

Don't upset me! I can't cry! 

FRANK

Getting an eye job like some Manhattanite, huh? 

ESTELLE

Well, it's already working. Kramer made a pass at me. 

FRANK

Kramer made a pass at you? You're crazy. 

ESTELLE

I'm not crazy. He stopped short and made a grab. 

FRANK

He stopped short? That's my move. I'm gonna kill him! 

ELAINE

Hey, let me ask you a question. 

DAVID

Sure. 

ELAINE

What do you charge for blown shocks? 

DAVID

What? 

ELAINE

Two, three hundred? 

DAVID

I don't know. Maybe five hundred. 

ELAINE

Ah. 

ELAINE

What about a bad gasket? 

DAVID

Bad gasket? 

ELAINE

Yeah. Like a terrible gasket. 

DAVID

What is all this? 

ELAINE

Nothing, nothing. I'm just taking an interest in what you...do. 

DAVID

What kind of car is it? 

ELAINE

Oh...any kind of---of a Swedish car. 

DAVID

All together, that could run about sixteen hundred. 

ELAINE

Oh. 

ELAINE

Is that with the parts and labor? 

DAVID

Uh-huh. 

ELAINE

Hmm. 

ELAINE

Oh, no. No, David. No, please. Not the knuckle.... 

NANCY

Wow. That was...*great*. I mean...*wow*. 

GEORGE

It just came to me. 

NANCY

I---I've never in my life have---have I---. What was that? 

GEORGE

You mean in the end? 

NANCY

Uh-huh. 

GEORGE

A counter-clockwise swirl. 

NANCY

What's that? 

GEORGE

What? 

NANCY

On---on your hand? Let me see what's on your hand. 

GEORGE

Nothing. I don't know...just a little dirt. 

NANCY

Give me that. (grabs his hand) I wanna see what's on your hand. 

NANCY

Number one. Take her leg.... Oh, my god! Crib notes? You've got crib notes?!! 

GEORGE

It's a very complicated move! I couldn't remember it all. 

NANCY

Oh, my god, you're sick. (gets out of bed) 

GEORGE

You know, it's not the S.A.T.s! 

FRANK

Assman? I'll get him, Assman! 

JERRY

Sixteen hundred dollars? That's all? *Ooh*, they are ripping me off. 

ELAINE

So what are you going to do? 

JERRY

Well, that's it. I'm going back to Putty. No move is worth this. 

ELAINE

Oh! You mean you don't care if he does the move anymore? 

JERRY

Are you kidding? He can do every move I've ever done! Do you know what a good mechanic is worth? You can't compare that to sex. 

JERRY

Hi, Mr. Constanza. What's uh...? 

FRANK

Where's your friend Kramer? 

JERRY

I don't know. Why? 

FRANK

Because I'm looking for him. That's why. He stopped short. 

JERRY

What do you mean? 

FRANK

In a car, with my wife. He stopped short. You think I don't know what that's about? That's my old move! I used it on Estelle forty years ago! I told everybody about it! Everybody knows! (Demonstrates) Hmmph! I stopped short. 

JERRY

Really, stopping short. That's a good move. 

FRANK

You're not kidding it's a good move! 

KRAMER

Hey. 

JERRY

Hey. 

KRAMER

Hey, Frank. 

FRANK

Don't Frank me! I know what you did. How dare you stop short with my wife! 

KRAMER

C'mon, Frank, relax. I don't even know what you're talking about. 

FRANK

You think I don't know, Assman?!! To think I almost split the profits on the Manssierre with you. 

KRAMER

Bro. 

FRANK

Manssierre! 

KRAMER

Bro! 

FRANK

Manssierre! You...! 

FRANK

Aah!!! 

JERRY

Oh, my god! 

JERRY

If I wasn't there, I wouldn't have believed it. 

ELAINE

Me either. 

GEORGE

They say this guy's the best. 

JERRY

He had to use cork-screw pasta. 

KRAMER

Jerry. Jerry, come here. Take a look at this. 

KRAMER

The name on the boat. Look at it. 

JERRY

Assman! 

KRAMER

Yeah (points towards the doctor's office), he's the Assman! Jerry, *he's* the Assman! 

DOCTOR

Which one is the son? 

GEORGE

(stands up) I am. 

DOCTOR

Ah. I'm Doctor Cooperman. I just want you to know that this won't take long. And he's going to be fine. 

KRAMER

Yeah, excuse me, uh... You didn't by any chance recently get the wrong license plates? 

COOPERMAN

Yes. I'm still waiting for the motor vehicle bureau to straighten it out. 

KRAMER

So...you're the Assman. 

FRANK

It was a million to one shot, Doc. Million to one. 

ESTELLE

Where have you been?!! You were supposed to fix the stove! I've been waiting for hours! 

FRANK

I fell on some Fusilli. 

ESTELLE

Fusilli? 

FRANK

You know, the corkscrew pasta. It was a Fusilli Jerry. It got stuck in me. Had to go to the proctologist. 

ESTELLE

The proctologist? Are you okay? 

FRANK

Yeah. 

ESTELLE

Oh, I was so worried. (grabs a couple of tissues from the box) 

GEORGE

Ma, don't cry! 

ESTELLE

Oh, I can't help it! 

GEORGE

Ma, your eyes! 

ESTELLE

Oh! 

JERRY

What time does your flight get in? Six? All right, that gives us six hours. Then I'll meet you at the diplomat's club. I'll be the one without the big red sash. Okay, see you tonight. (Hangs up) 

ELAINE

Is that the supermodel? 

JERRY

Yep, she's not gonna be back for a month, but I got six hours. 

ELAINE

I thought you had a show in Ithaca. 

JERRY

I do, but it's three o'clock and then I'm flying right back and meeting Bridget at the Diplomat's Club in the airport. 

ELAINE

Well, guess what I'm doing. I'm going to Mr. Pitt's, and I am telling him that I am quitting. 

JERRY

So that's it? You know I never even met the guy. 

ELAINE

I've had enough. I am marchin' in. 

JERRY

You're marchin' in. 

ELAINE

I'm marchin'. (Enter George) 

GEORGE

Hey. 

JERRY

Hey. Elaine's quitting. 

GEORGE

Really? 

ELAINE

I'm marchin' in. 

GEORGE

I've done the march in. Best feeling in the world. 

JERRY

How 'bout the march out? 

GEORGE

Not as good. That's when you realize all the money you're losing. 

ELAINE

This is it. Wish me luck. 

JERRY

Get a march goin'! March it! (She exits) 

GEORGE

Jerry, I need to borrow your camera. 

JERRY

Why? 

GEORGE

Well, I wanna put a picture of me and my boss Mr. Morgan up at the office. 

JERRY

What for? 

GEORGE

They're reorganizing the staff, and I'm on thin ice with this guy as it is. 

JERRY

Isn't putting this guy's picture on your desk a little transparent? 

GEORGE

It better be. 

ELAINE

Mr. Pitt, I have something to tell you. 

PITT

One second Elaine. 

ELAINE

Mr. Pitt... 

PITT

Elaine, you know what I just did? I just amended my will to include you as a beneficiary. 

ELAINE

What? 

PITT

Well, I think of you as part of my family. You've come to be like a daughter to me and I want to make sure you're taken care of after I'm gone. 

ELAINE

(Flattered) Mr. Pitt... 

PITT

(Sneezes) Elaine, I feel a cold coming on. Could you get me a cold pill from the medicine cabinet? 

ELAINE

Oh no no, Mr. Pitt, you mustn't. You have to check with the pharmacy before you combine anything with your heart medicine, 

PITT

Yes, yes, I'll check with the pharmacist. 

ELAINE

We don't want anything to happen to you Mr. Pitt. We want you to live a long, long time. 

GEORGE

(Holding camera) Look at this, I only have one picture left... How 'bout a shot of me and Mr. Morgan? 

MORGAN

Why? 

GEORGE

Why? Because we're a team! C'mon! Would you take this for us, dear? Thank you very much. Here we go... (To Morgan) Anyone ever tell you you look a lot like Sugar Ray Leonard? Yeah, you must get that all the time. 

MORGAN

I suppose we all look alike to you, right Costanza? 

GEORGE

No, not a racial thing, there really is a resemblance... 

ELAINE

Oh my God. 

WOMAN

Who are you? 

PITT

This is the girl I want to put in my will. Elaine... 

MAN

Please, rest Mr. Pitt. 

WOMAN

You're the assistant? Why weren't you taking care of him? 

ELAINE

Well, he gave me the morning off, I was doing a little... shopping. How did this happen? 

MAN

Took a very dangerous combination: prescription heart medicine and these other pills. 

ELAINE

Mr. Pitt, you were s'posed to talk with the pharmacist. 

PITT

I spoke to someone who worked there. 

ELAINE

I'm gonna go and call that pharmacist. (She exits) 

WOMAN

How well do you know her? 

KATE

Jerry, listen, just so you know, before we take off they're gonna tell us what to do in the vent of a crash- 

JERRY

Yes, I know. I've flown before. 

KATE

Oh good. I just didn't want you to freak out... The chance of a crash is very slim. Do you have to go to the bathroom? 

JERRY

No. 

KATE

(Pause) Because even if you have (Jerry gets up to go) to go a little you'd better go now because you won't get another chance until way after take off. 

KRAMER

Hey, how you doin'? 

EARL

Pretty good. 

KRAMER

Name's Kramer. 

EARL

Earl Hafler, nice to meet you. I'm headed to Houston, where you headed? 

KRAMER

Oh I'm happy right here. Isn't this place amazing? Planes flying in from all corners of the world, and they know the minute they're arriving. 

EARL

Ah they don't know a darn thing. That's why my flight the Houston's been delayed. They're all morons. Matter of fact, I'll bet you that that flight to Pittsburgh takes off before my flight to Houston. 

KRAMER

Bet? Um, not betting. 

EARL

Friendly wager. 

KRAMER

I haven't made a bet in three years, I- 

EARL

Ah c'mon. Keep things interesting, pass the time. 

KRAMER

Okay, how much? 

EARL

How 'bout 200? 

KRAMER

You're on, cowboy! 

GEORGE

How ya doin'? 

MAN

Okay. 

GEORGE

Nice day today. 

MAN

What? 

GEORGE

I'm George. George Costanza, you live around here? 

INTERCOM

Now arriving at gate 12... 

EARL

This could be Mexico City. 

KRAMER

C'mon Seattle, let's go. 

EARL

Come on, Mexico City! 

KRAMER

Seattle, yeah! 

INTERCOM

...flight 42 from Mexico City. 

KRAMER

All right, c'mon, let's go again. 

ELAINE

Mr. Pitt, do you need anything? 

PITT

No. 

ELAINE

You need something to sit up. Why don't I get you a pillow? 

PITT

Okay. 

KATE

It's a pretty full house, the lighting guy's name is Lew, he's got a birthday next week. 

JERRY

I don't care. 

KATE

By the way, Jerry, I don't want you to freak out, but the pilot is going to be in the audience. 

JERRY

Who? 

KATE

Remember the plane we took here? The pilot is gonna be sitting out there watching the show. 

JERRY

I don't care, why are you telling me this? 

KATE

I just didn't want you to freak out when you saw him. 

JERRY

Why would I freak out? (To himself) Pilot... 

JERRY

Hey, all right. Good afternoon Ithaca. Welcome, good to see you here... Boy, I'll tell you, there's an awful lot of those orange cones you have on the throughway... (Sees pilot) on the way... up here... um... I.. 

KATE

It didn't go very well, did it? 

JERRY

No, it didn't. And you know why? Seeing the pilot in the audience really freaked me out. 

KATE

I knew it. 

JERRY

If you hadn't mentioned anything, I would have been fine. I became obsessed with him. 

KATE

Why did we invite him? Stupid, stupid. when he asked for a ticket, I should have said no. I'm gonna go chew him out. 

JERRY

Oh, it doesn't matter now. 

KATE

Don't worry, Jerry. I'm on top of this. 

JERRY

Yeah, you're on top of it, and I'm on the bottom! 

EARL

Well, Mr. Kramer, looks like you're in the hole $3200... Will that be cash or check? 

KRAMER

All right, look, one more bet. Double or nothing. C'mon. 

EARL

All right, but I wanna see some cash on the table. 

KRAMER

All right, let me call my bank. You stay here. (He calls) 

NEWMAN

Hello? 

KRAMER

Yeah, it's, uh, me. 

NEWMAN

Hey, what's up? 

KRAMER

All right, listen. I need some cash. 

NEWMAN

What for? 

KRAMER

I just need it, that's all. 

NEWMAN

Oh no. Don't tell me. You're gambling again, aren't you? Oh you weak, weak man. Where are you? 

KRAMER

I'm at the airport. 

NEWMAN

The airport? 

KRAMER

We've been betting on arrivals and departures. (Newman rolls eyes) But I'm down $3200 , so you've gotta get me some cash. 

NEWMAN

I don't have that kinda dough. 

KRAMER

Sure you do. 

NEWMAN

Oh no, no, not the bag! 

KRAMER

Oh help me man, I'm desperate! 

NEWMAN

All right, all right. 

INTERCOM

Sorry for the delay, folks, there is a slight complication that we're taking care of, and then we'll be on our way to La Guardia... 

JERRY

(To Katie) What is the complication? 

ATTENDANT

Mr. Seinfeld? 

JERRY

Yes? 

ATTENDANT

I'm sorry, but the pilot has asked that you leave this plane. 

JERRY

What? 

ATTENDANT

Apparently, he has some sort of problem with you. 

KATE

I'm not surprised. I really let him have it, Jerry. He has no business being in your audience if you didn't want him there. 

JERRY

I didn't care. 

ATTENDANT

Well, now the pilot doesn't want you on his plane. 

JERRY

He can't just throw me off the plane! 

ATTENDANT

Yes he can, if he has cause to believe a passenger will be a disturbance. 

JERRY

But I'm not a disturbance! 

ATTENDANT

Well, apparently you are disturbing him, sir. 

JERRY

But someone is waiting for me! 

KATE

Jerry, I don't want you to freak out. 

JERRY

I'm freakin' out! I am freakin' out! 

KATE

There's a flight leaving at eight, and another one at eight-thirty, which one do you want? 

JERRY

Which one do you think I want? 

KATE

The eight will get you in a little earlier. 

JERRY

Then we'll make it the eight. 

KATE

I'll book a hotel, do you want a standard room or mini suite?] 

JERRY

Hotel? 

KATE

Yeah, it's eight in the morning. 

JERRY

No, no, no. I have to get home tonight. Bridget's gonna be waiting for me at the Diplomat's Club. Rent a car. 

KATE

Mid-size, luxury, or sports model, what's your preference? 

JERRY

I don't have a preference, okay! Just make a decision yourself! Stop bothering me with every minor little detail, please? 

KATE

Okay, you're a big celebrity. (She exits) 

GEORGE

Yo. 

JERRY

George. 

GEORGE

Hey, Jerry, how was Ithaca? 

JERRY

I'm still here. Listen, you gotta go down to the Diplomat's Club... 

GEORGE

Hey, Jerry, what was the name of the exterminator who fumigated your apartment when you had fleas? 

JERRY

Carl, I think. 

GEORGE

Carl... Yeah, he was a nice guy. 

JERRY

Yeah, he was nice. 

GEORGE

What company was it? 

JERRY

Defent. 

GEORGE

Yeah, you know we spoke for a little bit... 

JERRY

You need an exterminator? 

GEORGE

No, not really. 

JERRY

Oh, don't tell me. 'Cause he's black? 

GEORGE

Gotta go. 

JERRY

George, George! 

JERRY

Hello, this is Jerry Seinfeld. Is Elaine there? 

WOMAN

Hold on... Elaine, there's a Jerry Seinfeld on the phone for you. 

ELAINE

Hello? 

JERRY

Elaine, I need you to do me a big favor. I need you to go down to the Diplomat's Club and meet Bridget for me. I'm going to be late. 

ELAINE

That's at the airport, right? 

JERRY

Right, I don't want Bridget to think I stood her up. I'll never get another date with her. She'll freak out. 

ELAINE

All right, all right. You sound a little freaked out yourself. 

JERRY

I am a little freaked out! 

ELAINE

Calm down, I'll take care of it. (Ms. Walker looks suspicious of Elaine) 

JERRY

All right, but you have to go now. 

ELAINE

I said I'll take care of it! 

NEWMAN

Kramer. 

KRAMER

Hey. 

NEWMAN

Okay, here it is. 

KRAMER

Good. (To Earl) Here's my collateral. 

EARL

So it's a mailbag, so what? 

NEWMAN

So what? Do you know whose mailbag that is? 

EARL

(Reading) David Berkowitz. 

NEWMAN

Son of Sam. The worst mass murderer the post office ever produced. 

EARL

Where did you get this? 

NEWMAN

I took over his route. And boy, were there a lot of dogs on that route. 

EARL

Any of 'em talk to you? 

NEWMAN

Just to tell me to keep off the snacks! 

EARL

(To Kramer) Your buddy's a helluva guy. 

KRAMER

Yeah, don't I know it. 

EARL

Okay, Cosmo, we're back in business. Let's check out the board. Now, who do you like? 

KRAMER

All right, how 'bout Ithaca vs. Boston? 

EARL

All right, I'll give you a sportin' chance. I'll take Ithaca. 

KRAMER

Double or nothin'. 

EARL

Double or nothin'. 

NEWMAN

I hope you know what you're doing... (Kramer gives Newman a look of lack of confidence) 

JERRY

(Wakes up) Where are we? 

KATE

I'm not sure. 

JERRY

Is this even a road? 

KATE

Oh we lost the road a half hour ago. 

JERRY

What? Why didn't you wake me up? 

KATE

You told me not to bother you with minor details. 

JERRY

No, road is a major detail! 

KATE

Okay, now I know. Should I keep going or turn around, do you have a preference? 

JERRY

(Pointing ahead) Look out! 

GEORGE

May I help you? 

CARL

I'm the exterminator. 

GEORGE

Oh, yes of course, come in. 

CARL

Why didn't you want me to bring my equipment or wear my uniform? 

GEORGE

Yes, well, if the other people in the office saw that I called an exterminator, they would just panic. Besides, this is sort of a friendly visit. Carl, right? 

CARL

Do I know you? 

GEORGE

Yeah, sure, we met at Jerry Seinfeld's apartment. When you fumigated for fleas over there. 

CARL

Seinfeld... Oh yeah, funny white guy, right? 

GEORGE

Jerry? Yes, I suppose he is white. You know, I never really thought about it. I don't see people in terms of color. You know, there's someone I'd like you to meet. Hand on... (To phone) Is Mr. Morgan in? 

PHONE

Mr. Morgan left for dinner. 

GEORGE

He left... huh... Carl, you hungry? 

TV

Here's a new twist on car pooling: Early this morning, a lost Manhattanite drove through a residential backyard and wound up in a swimming pool near Ithaca, New York. Comedian Jerry Seinfeld, a passenger, seemed a little freaked out. 

JERRY

That's it! No more questions! I don't care! 

PITT

That's him! That's the man who gave me the pills in the drug store! He's no pharmacist. 

WOMANEWMAN

Jerry Seinfeld... I know that name. He called here earlier for Elaine. (She looks at Mr. Pitt) 

GEORGE

(To Carl) Oh, by the way, order anything you want, it's all on me. Just do me a tiny favor: pretend we're old friends. Oh my God! Mr. Morgan! What a coincidence, it's Mr. Morgan. Mr. Morgan, I want you to meet a dear old friend of mine, Carl. 

CARL

I'm the exterminator. (Morgan confused) 

GEORGE

That's... what we used to call him in high school, the exterminator. He's a linebacker. Oh, did we have some wild times. 

EARL

Well, that Newman was your good luck charm. 

KRAMER

Yeah, he was. 

EARL

I should have quitted at double or nothin'. Travelers checks acceptable? 

KRAMER

Oh I accept. 

NEWMANEWMAN

(Talking to another man) ...yeah he worked in the cubicle right next to me. We once double dated. 

KRAMER

Yeah, it's a pleasure doin' business with a gentleman like yourself. (Elaine enters) 

ELAINE

Kramer. 

KRAMER

Oh hi Elaine. What are you doing here? 

ELAINE

Jerry asked me to meet his girlfriend here. Did you here about his plane in Ithaca? 

EARL

What about the plane in Ithaca? 

ELAINE

Oh, our stupid friend freaked out the pilot. Single handedly delayed the plane a whole hour. Can you believe that? 

KRAMER

Boy... 

EARL

Your friend caused the delay? 

ELAINE

Uh huh. 

EARL

You're a cheat! Nobody hustles Earl Hafler. 

KRAMER

C'mon! 

EARL

See you around, Cosmo. 

KRAMER

What? 

ELAINE

Poison you? Jerry Seinfeld tried to poison you? Wha? Mr. Pitt, what are you, delirious? He's never even met you! 

PITT

You're fired, Elaine. Goodbye. 

ELAINE

Goodbye? (Elaine thinks of memories with Mr. Pitt) 

JERRY

Bridget! 

BRIDGET

Jerry, what happened? 

JERRY

Oh, I'm so sorry. I got stuck out of town. I missed our whole time together. 

BRIDGET

Well, my plane doesn't leave for another half hour. 

JERRY

Really? (They start to make out, Jerry sees the pilot on the plane) Oh my God, that's him! That's the pilot! 

GEORGE

I love this place. You know, Carl and I come here all the time. 

MORGANEWMAN

Is that right? 

CARL

Yeah, I come here all the time. You wouldn't believe the rat problems in the kitchen. 

MORGANEWMAN

(George spits out food) I thought so. You really are an exterminator. This time, George, you've sunk to a new low. (He leaves) 

GEORGE

Check, please. 

WAITER

Hey, Sugar Ray Leonard can eat here on the house. 

GEORGE

Mr. Morgan! Did you hear that? Mr. Morgan! 

GEORGE

Take toilet paper for example. Do you realize that toilet paper has not changed in my lifetime? It's just paper on a cardboard roll, that's it. And in ten thousand years, it will still be exactly the same because really, what else can they do? 

SIENA

That's true. There really has been no development in toilet paper. 

GEORGE

And everything else has changed. But toilet paper is exactly the same, and will be so until we're dead. 

SIENA

Yeah, you're right George. What else can they do? 

GEORGE

It's just paper on a roll, that's it. And that's all it will ever be. 

SIENA

Wow. 

GEORGE

You find this interesting, don't you? 

SIENA

Yes. yes, I do. 

ELAINE

(to the busboy) Oh, thanks very much, the soup was really good. 

JERRY

What are you telling him for? 

ELAINE

What? 

JERRY

He's the busboy, you think he cares about the soup? 

ELAINE

Yeah, why? Wouldn't he want the soup to be good? 

JERRY

Elaine, it's all this guy can do to keep from killing himself. You think he's back there, talking to the chef, going, 'Hey, they like the soup! Keep it up!'? 

ELAINE

Hey, isn't that Alec Berg? 

JERRY

Yep, Alec Berg. He's got a good 'John Houseman' name. Alec Beeerg. Mr. Beeerg. 

ELAINE

I can't stand him, he is so pretentious. 

JERRY

John Houseman? 

ELAINE

No, Alec Berg. 

ALEC

(approaching) Elaine! 

ELAINE

Hi! 

ALEC

Hi, how are you? Jerry. 

JERRY

Hi, Alec. 

ALEC

Did you hear about Gary Fogel? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

ALEC

You gonna go to the funeral on Friday? 

JERRY

Yeah, hey did I see you on TV at the Ranger game? Were those your seats right behind the glass? 

ALEC

Those are them, yeah. Season tickets. Uh, you know, unfortunately I can't go tonight, so they're available if you'd like to use them. 

JERRY

Oh, I'd love to, are you sure? 

ALEC

Absolutely, you just call my secretary, she'll arrange everything. 

JERRY

Gee thanks! Thanks a lot! 

ALEC

It's my pleasure. Be good. (Walking away, he stops abruptly) You know, I actually might not use them on Friday either so I'll let you know. 

JERRY

Alright, thanks again. 

ELAINE

Thank you very much. 

JERRY

Really, thank you. 

JERRY

Well what about these nitwits that get on a plane with nothing to read? You know who these people are? 

ELAINE

Who? 

JERRY

These are the people that want to talk to you. They got nothing else to do, why not disturb you? 

ELAINE

I will never understand people. 

JERRY

They're the worst. 

GEORGE

Something's up, there's something in the air. 

JERRY

Well, what is with you? 

GEORGE

Well, I think this is it. 

ELAINE

What's it? 

GEORGE

I saw Siena again. 

ELAINE

Siena? 

JERRY

Yeah, he's dating a crayon. 

GEORGE

We discussed toilet paper. 

JERRY

Toilet paper? 

GEORGE

Yeah, I told her how toilet paper hasn't changed in my lifetime, and probably wouldn't change in the next fifty thousand years and she was fascinated, fascinated! 

JERRY

What are you talking about? 

ELAINE

Yeah. 

JERRY

Toilet paper's changed. 

ELAINE

Yeah. 

JERRY

It's softer. 

ELAINE

Softer. 

JERRY

More sheets per roll 

ELAINE

Sheets. 

JERRY

Comes in a wide variety of colors. 

ELAINE

Colors. 

GEORGE

Ok, ok, fine! It's changed, it's not really the point. Anyway, I'm thinking of making a big move. 

JERRY

What? 

GEORGE

I might tell her that I love her. I came this close last night, then I just chickened out. 

JERRY

Well, that's a big move, Georgie boy. Are you confident in the 'I love you' return? 

GEORGE

Fifty-fifty. 

JERRY

Cause if you don't get that return, that's a pretty big matzoh ball hanging out there. 

GEORGE

Aw, I've just got to say it once, everybody else gets to say it, why can't I say it? 

ELAINE

What, you never said it? 

GEORGE

Once, to a dog. He licked himself and left the room. 

JERRY

Well, so it wasn't a total loss. 

KRAMER

Hey. 

JERRY

Hey, I forgot to tell you! I got tickets to the Rangers-Devils playoff game tonight! 

KRAMER

Oh, I'm there, Monongahela! 

JERRY

What about you, George? 

GEORGE

Eh eh eh, can't do it, can't do it, sorry, I got a date. 

KRAMER

So, so. 

GEORGE

Oh no no no, if you must know, I would rather be with her than go to the game. 

KRAMER

She must be a very special lady, huh George, yeah. 

JERRY

Well, what do I do with the extra ticket? 

ELAINE

Oh hey, can I bring David Puddy? He's a big Devils' fan. 

JERRY

Sure, fine with me. 

GEORGE

Hey, by the way, if anybody wants an inside tour of the zoo, Siena works there as a trainer. 

KRAMER

So she works at the zoo? 

GEORGE

Yeah, yeah. 

KRAMER

Yeah, like Diane Fosse. You know she's the only person that's ever been accepted into gorilla society. And you know, once those gorillas accept you, you got it made in the shade. 

ELAINE

So how long have you been a Devils' fan? 

PUDDY

(off camera) Since I was a kid, I'm from Jersey. 

ELAINE

Yeah? Well, we're gonna kick your butts tonight. 

PUDDY

Hey, no way, man. 

ELAINE

Yes. 

PUDDY

We're primed. 

ELAINE

Alright, you almost ready? Cause Jerry and Kramer are gonna be here any second. 

ELAINE

What the-- 

PUDDY

So what do you think? 

ELAINE

What is that? 

PUDDY

I painted my face. 

ELAINE

(still in disbelief) You painted your face? 

PUDDY

Yeah. 

ELAINE

Why? 

PUDDY

You know, support the team. 

ELAINE

Well, you can't walk around like that. 

PUDDY

Why not? 

ELAINE

Because it's insane? 

PUDDY

Hey, you gotta let them know you're out there, this is the playoffs. 

KRAMER

Hey. 

PUDDY

Hey. 

ELAINE

Dave, um, painted his face. 

KRAMER

Yeah, that's cool. Well, you gotta support your team. 

PUDDY

Ok, ready to go? 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

PUDDY

(startlingly loud) LET'S GET IT ON!!! Alright!! Go Devils!! Go Devils!! Let's go Devils!! 

PUDDY

You're dead, Messier! We're gonna get you, Messier! 

PUDDY

Hey man, I'm just trying to support the team. 

ELAINE

Will you sit down? You're disturbing everybody. Sit down! 

PUDDY

Oh yeah, because you're a Ranger fan and you know I'm messing with their heads. 

PUDDY

Go Devils!! 

ANNOUNCER

Devils goal! Stephan Richer scores from just inside the blue line! And the Devils take-- (George turns down the volume) 

GEORGE

You know, I could have actually gone to that. 

SIENA

So why didn't you? 

GEORGE

Well, I didn't want to break our date. 

SIENA

Oh, well. 

GEORGE

Because I... I love you. 

SIENA

You know, I'm hungry. Let's get something to eat. 

PUDDY

Ha ha! We took it to you! You couldn't get it out of your zone all night. We were aggressive, we didn't let you penetrate! 

KRAMER

Alright, that's enough out of you, there's still three more games left in this series, my friend, and it's far from being over. Very far from being over. (Notices a car coming right towards Puddy, who's crossing the street) Watch out! 

PUDDY

(pounding the hood) Hey, what are you doing?! Watch where you're driving, man! (He approaches the passenger side window) Don't mess with the Devils, buddy. We're number one, we beat anybody! We're the Devils! The Devils!! Haaaa!!! 

HERNANDEZ

El Diablo! Dios mio! El Diablo!! 

JERRY

'I'm hungry. Let's get something to eat.' 

GEORGE

Yup. 

JERRY

Big matzoh ball. 

GEORGE

Huge matzoh ball. 

JERRY

Those damn 'I love you' returns. 

GEORGE

Well, it's all over. I slipped up. 

JERRY

Oh, you don't know. 

GEORGE

You have any idea how fast these things deteriorate when there's an 'I love you' out of the bag? You can't have a relationship where one person says, 'I love you', and the other says, 'I'm hungry. Let's get something to eat.'. 

JERRY

Unless you're married. 

GEORGE

I mean, now she thinks that I'm one of these guys that love her. Nobody wants to be with somebody that loves them. 

JERRY

No, people hate that. 

GEORGE

You want to be with somebody that doesn't like you. 

JERRY

Ideally. 

GEORGE

I am never saying 'I love you' again unless they say it first. 

WAITRESS

Matzoh ball soup? 

GEORGE

That'd be me. 

KRAMER

Hey, Jerry? You're a smart guy, right? 

JERRY

No question about it. 

KRAMER

Alright, you know I'm supposed to go on this special tour today with George's girlfriend. 

JERRY

At the zoo? 

KRAMER

Yeah, but before I met up with her, I stopped to look at the monkeys, when all of a sudden I am hit in the face with a banana peel. I turn and look and there is this monkey really laughing it up. Then someone tells me that he did it. Well, I pick up the banana peel and I wait for that monkey to turn around. And then I *whap* let him have it. 

JERRY

Kramer, you threw a banana peel at a monkey? 

KRAMER

Well, he started it! 

JERRY

It's a monkey, Kramer! 

KRAMER

Well, he pushed my buttons, I couldn't help it, Jerry. 

JERRY

Well, I still think it's wrong. 

KRAMER

Alright, alright, fine. You take the monkey's side, alright, go ahead. 

JERRY

I'm not taking anyone's side. 

KRAMER

(walking out) Cause I know what happened, Jerry. (remembering something and walking back in) Did you call Alec Berg and thank him for the hockey tickets? 

JERRY

No. 

KRAMER

Oh, Jerry, what are you waiting for? 

JERRY

What do I gotta call him for? I thanked him five times when he gave them to me, how many time I gotta thank him? 

KRAMER

Oh, no no no, you gotta call him the next day, it's common courtesy. 

JERRY

No, I don't believe in it. I'm taking a stand against all this over thanking. 

KRAMER

Jerry, good manners are the glue of society. 

JERRY

Hey, if I knew I had to give him eight million 'thank you's, I wouldn't have taken the tickets in the first place. 

KRAMER

Alright, you know what this is gonna do? He's gonna be upset because you didn't call him and we're not gonna get those tickets for Friday night. 

JERRY

Ah, you're out of your mind. 

KRAMER

Alright, where you going? 

JERRY

I gotta get a suit cleaned, I have a funeral on Friday. 

KRAMER

Who died? 

JERRY

Remember the guy who pretended he had cancer so O would buy him the toupee? 

KRAMER

So he actually had it? 

JERRY

No, car accident. He was trying to adjust his toupee while he was driving and he lost control of the car. 

ELAINE

That poor priest. He was just visiting from El Salvador. Now he's gone completely loco. 

JERRY

The one Puddy screamed at in the car? 

ELAINE

Yeah. He thinks he saw the devil. He won't leave his room in the church basement. 

JERRY

Well, that's what you get for getting mixed up with a face painter. 

ELAINE

I mean, what compels a seemingly normal human being to do something like that? 

JERRY

Gotta support the team. 

ELAINE

You know I really hate my clothes. 

JERRY

Hm. 

ELAINE

I open up my closet, there's just nothing. 

JERRY

Hm. 

ELAINE

Nothing. I hate everything I have, I really hate it. (The weeping increases in volume and intensity) I mean, at this point, it's like I can wear something three or four times and that's it. 

JERRY

Hm. 

ELAINE

It's getting to be a terrible problem for me. 

JERRY

(noticing Alec Berg walk in, whispers) Hey, Alec! 

JERRY

Did you see that? What kind of a 'hello' was that? 

PLESS

Ah, Mr. Kramer? 

KRAMER

Yes. 

PLESS

Thanks for coming. 

KRAMER

So, uh, what did you want to see me about? 

PLESS

Well, Mr. Kramer, to get right to it, we're having a bit of a problem with Barry. 

KRAMER

Barry? 

PLESS

The chimpanzee. 

KRAMER

Oh. Well, uh, what's the problem? 

PLESS

Well, he's not functioning the way he normally does. He seems depressed. He's lost his appetite. He's even curtailed his autoerotic activities. And we think this is directly related to the altercation he had with you the other day. 

KRAMER

So, so what do you want me to do? 

PLESS

Well, frankly we'd like you to apologize. 

KRAMER

Yeah, well he started it. 

PLESS

Mr. Kramer, he is an innocent primate. 

KRAMER

So am I. What about my feelings? Don't my feelings count for anything? Oh, only the poor monkey's important. Everything has to be done for the monkey! Look, I'm sorry. I-- 

SIENA

Hey, that's ok. Well, I've gotta go feed the marmosets. 

KRAMER

(to Siena as she's walking out, but she appears to ignore) You know George really likes you. 

PLESS

She doesn't hear too well out of her left ear. 

KRAMER

Oh. 

JERRY

I mean, do you think it's possible that he's mad at me because he didn't get the day-after 'thank you'? 

GEORGE

Wait a minute, you were at a funeral, right? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

GEORGE

Well, people never give a good 'hello' at a funeral. I mean, they go like this (George gives an extremely understated nod) That's the biggest. 

JERRY

Yeah, yeah, that's kinda what he gave me. 

GEORGE

Hey, they can't go, 'Hey! You look fabulous!' 

JERRY

Hey. 

KRAMER

Hey. Well, I just spoke to your girlfriend. 

GEORGE

Girlfriend, yeah, right. 

KRAMER

Anyway, she asked me to apologize to Barry. 

GEORGE

Barry? 

KRAMER

The monkey. 

JERRY

Well? 

KRAMER

Nothing doing. Jerry, I didn't do anything. It's the monkey that should be apologizing to me. 

JERRY

Well, I don't think that's gonna happen. 

KRAMER

Well, I'm sorry. Well, George, I tried to put the good word in for you with Siena, but I don't think she heard me. You know, left ear? 

GEORGE

What? 

KRAMER

Yeah, her boss told me that she can't hear very well out of her left ear. What, you didn't know that? 

GEORGE

Oh my god. 

JERRY

What? 

GEORGE

She probably never heard it. Don't you see what this means? It's like the whole thing never happened. It's like when Superman reversed the rotation of the earth to save Lois Lane! 

JERRY

Are you gonna say it again? 

GEORGE

That's the question, Jimmy. 

GEORGE

I'm gonna do it. 

JERRY

What? After what you just went through, I thought you said you'd never say it again. 

GEORGE

I'd like to say it once to someone that can actually hear it! 

KRAMER

What's going on? 

JERRY

He's gonna talk into her other ear. 

KRAMER

Oh. Well listen, I almost forgot to ask you. What happened at the funeral? Now, did you talk to Alec berg? 

JERRY

Yeah, I saw him. 

KRAMER

Alright, so he's gonna give you the hockey tickets, huh? 

JERRY

Well, not exactly. 

KRAMER

He's mad, isn't he? See, I knew it. 

JERRY

I don't know if he's mad. 

KRAMER

Alright, so what happened when you saw him? 

JERRY

Well, I didn't really get a good 'hello', but see, I was at a funeral. 

KRAMER

Uh huh. 

JERRY

See, so I don't know if I got a funeral 'hello' or he was mad because he didn't get his day-after 'thank you'. 

KRAMER

See, I told you, Jerry, I told you! 

JERRY

Look, what do you want me to do? 

KRAMER

I want you to get on this phone and give him his 'thank you'! 

JERRY

No. No, I can't! 

KRAMER

Jerry, this is the way society functions. Aren't you a part of society? Because if you don't want to be a part of society, Jerry, why don't you just get in your car and move to the East Side! 

JERRY

Look, we got five hours before the game. I am betting it was a funeral 'hello'. He knows we're here, he knows the number, he knows we want to go. There's plenty of time for him to call and give us the tickets. 

KRAMER

You stubborn, stupid, silly man! 

PUDDY

Hey, great dip. You made this? 

ELAINE

No, it's from the store. 

PUDDY

Oh. Hey, how come people don't have dip for dinner? Why is it only a snack, why can't it be a meal, you know? I don't understand stuff like that. 

ELAINE

David? David, I think we aught to talk. 

PUDDY

Alright, that's cool. 

ELAINE

David, I don't think we should see each other anymore. 

PUDDY

You gotta be kidding, how come? 

ELAINE

Well, you see, David, you're a face painter. 

PUDDY

Yeah, that's right. 

ELAINE

Well, it's not that I don't like you, but, well to be perfectly honest, I'm just having some trouble getting past the face painting. 

PUDDY

Well, alright, so you don't like the face painting, I just won't paint it anymore. 

ELAINE

Yeah, but you like the face painting. 

PUDDY

Well, I don't need to do it. It's not like a habit or anything. 

ELAINE

Oh. You mean you'd stop it for me? 

PUDDY

Yeah, that's right. 

ELAINE

That's so, that's so sweet. 

PUDDY

Ah, c'mere. (They kiss) Alright, I gotta go home and get changed before the game. I'll be back, we'll make out. 

GEORGE

Siena, I love you. 

SIENA

Yeah, I know. I heard you the first time. 

GEORGE

Yeah. Just confirming. 

JERRY

Hello? Oh, hi mom. No, listen, I was expecting somebody else. I'm sorry, I can't talk now, I gotta keep the line clear, I'll call you later. Yes, I know I have call waiting but I don't trust it in an emergency. Good bye. 

KRAMER

Anyway, I um, I just want to say that I'm sorry. I lost my temper and I probably shouldn't have. I took it out on you and, look, if I've caused you any problems as a result of my behavior, well then, I'm sorry. I apologize. Even though, Barry, between me and you, we both know that you started it. I mean, who's kidding who? But they tell me that you're very upset, and god forbid I should disturb the very important monkey, I'm just hoping we can put this behind us, let's just move on with our lives, ok? So no hard feelings? 

ELAINE

What is that? 

PUDDY

That's the letter 'D'. 

ELAINE

Why is the letter 'D' painted on your chest? 

PUDDY

Well, I'm going to the game tonight, and me and these five other guys are gonna take our shirts off and spell out 'Devils'. 

ELAINE

But you said no more painting. 

PUDDY

No, I said no more face painting, and as you can see this is not my face. 

ELAINE

Yeah, that's right. 

KRAMER

Well? Did he call? 

JERRY

No. 

KRAMER

Oh, come on, Jerry! Come on, this is stupid! It's six o'clock! It's all over, just pick up the phone and thank him! 

JERRY

Alright! (picks up the phone and dials) Hello, Alec? Hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld. You know, you got a great 'John Houseman' name. Alec Berg. Did you hand in your assignment, Mr. Berg? 

ALEC

What can I do for you, Jerry? 

JERRY

Well, Alec, the reason I called is I just wanted to thank you for the tickets from the other night. 

ALEC

I wish you'd called me earlier, I could have given you my tickets for tonight. 

JERRY

Oh, you already gave them away? 

ALEC

Yeah, but you know what? I have a friend, he's got a couple of seats. If you don't mind the nose bleed section, they're yours. 

JERRY

No, we don't care, we just want to go. 

ALEC

There is one little catch, though. 

PUDDY

Hey, great game, huh? 

PRIEST

Father Hernandez? 

HERNANDEZ

Huh? 

PRIEST

Una senora que te vino a ver. Ella dice que tiene informacion muy importante, y que te puede ayudar. (Subtitled: 'A woman here to see you, she has important information that could be helpful to you.') 

HERNANDEZ

Bueno. 

PRIEST

Al fini finalmente par&oacute; el llover. (Subtitled: 'Finally it stopped raining.') 

HERNANDEZ

Aha, bueno. 

ELAINE

Hello father. 

HERNANDEZ

Oh. La Madonna! Madre de Christo! Yo estoy lista! 

GENNICE

(Crying) (sob sob) 

JERRY

(To himself) Now what am I supposed to do here? Shall I go over there? It's not like somebody died. It's 'Beaches' for god's sake. If she was sitting next to me I'd put my arm around her. I can't be making a big move like going all the way over there. I can't. I won't. 

JERRY

She calls me this morning and tells me she's upset I didn't console her. I mean it was 'Beaches' for god's sake. What, what do you do in a situation like that? 

GEORGE

Where were you? 

JERRY

I was sitting on the chair. She was over here on the couch. 

GEORGE

Well you know, if you were sitting right next to her you'd have to console her no matter what. 

JERRY

Of course. 

GEORGE

When you're talking about a movie like 'Beaches', moving from the chair to the couch , . . . that's quite a voyage. 

JERRY

yeah, 

KRAMER

Hey. 

GEORGE

Hey. I gotta go. 

KRAMER

Where you going? 

JERRY

The Improv is playing 'Rochelle Rochelle' The musical. 

KRAMER

Really? What is Bette Midler playing? Is she going to be there? 

JERRY

She might be. She's the star of the show. 

KRAMER

Bette Midler is going to be in the park today? Yeeee. Jerry, don't tease me. 

GEORGE

I didn't know you were such a Bette Midler fan. 

KRAMER

So maybe I'll go down there and watch, uh? She'll be there, ,maybe. 

GEORGE

Gennice palying today? 

JERRY

Yeah, maybe. 

KRAMER

Who's Gennice? 

JERRY

That's the understudy. I'm dating her. 

KRAMER

Oh, uh, is this uh, Bette Midler's understudy? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

KRAMER

Oh, understudies are a very shifty bunch. The substitute teachers of the theater world. 

JERRY

I'm glad she's an understudy. I don't have to avoid going back stage and having to think of something to say. 

GEORGE

Going backstage is the worst. Especially when they stink. You know that's a real problem. 

JERRY

Just once I would like to tell someone they stink. You know what? I doidn't like the show. I didn't like you. It just really stunk. The whole thing...real bad. Stinkaroo. Thanks for the tickets though. 

RUBY

You late. 

ELAINE

I know I know. I didn't have change for the bus and they don't give change in this city. So they threw me off the bus 

RUBY

'That's a shame'. You'll have to wait for Lotus now. 

ELAINE

How long do you think this will take. I have a millllioooon things to do. 

RUBY

'Mustn't keep the princess waiting. Princess in a big hurry.' 'No change for bus' 'Poor princess.' 

ELAINE

What?, uh? 

RUBY

Nothing, won't be long. 

LOTUS

'Princess wants a manicure.' 

SUNNY

'Oh lucky me.' 

LOTUS

'Oh, you got the princess.' 

ELAINE

What is so funny? 

RUBY

...tell knock-knock joke. 

ELAINE

The Korean women were talking about me. I think they were calling me a dog. 

JERRY

How would you know? You don't speak Korean. 

ELAINE

Because this woman came in with a dog and Ruby called the dog the same word they used when they were pointing at me...ge ge ge 

KRAMER

You know, maybe in Korean 'dog' isn't an insult. Could be like the word 'fox' to us. Oh, she's a DOG! 

JERRY

Why don't you go to another nail shop? 

ELAINE

Because they're the best Jerry, the best. Look. Maybe I'm just being paranoid. 

JERRY

What you need is a translator to go in the shop with you and tell you what they're saying. 

ELAINE

Yeah, who speaks Korean? 

JERRY

You know who speaks Korean? 

ELAINE

No, who? 

JERRY

George's father. 

ELAINE

You gotta' be kidding me. How does he speak Korean? 

JERRY

He used to go there a lot on business. 

ELAINE

What did he do? 

JERRY

He sold religious articles the statues of Jesus, the virgin Mary, that were manufactured in Korea. 

ELAINE

Uh, 

JERRY

George, does your father speak Korean? 

GEORGE

Yeah, he once bumped into reverend Yung Sun Moon. 

JERRY

Oh, hi Gennice. 

GENNICE

Hi Jerry. 

JERRY

This is George, this is Kramer. 

GENNICE

Nice to meet you. 

JERRY

Playing today? 

GENNICE

No. I'm on the bench today. 

JERRY

They really stick to that understudy rule. 

KRAMER

So she's coming? 

GENNICE

Oh, yeah, she'll be here. . . .(DROPS HOT DOG) Oh no, my frankfurter, my frankfurter fell (sob sob sob sob) . It was really good. I can't believe that I dropped it. (sob sob sob sob) 

JERRY

It's okay...it's just a hot dog, (still sobbing) everything is going to be okay. 

GENNICE

No it (sob) was really good. 

KRAMER

Look it's Bette It's Bette! Ah, Ah, AH, . . . Bette, psst, hi. 

BETTE

Hi. 

KRAMER

Uh, I just want to say I think you're wonderful. 

BETTE

Uh, thank you. 

KRAMER

Yeah, I've seen you in everything you've done. 

BETTE

Really? 

KRAMER

Anything I can get you? Water? They got ice over here. 

BETTE

What flavours do they have? 

KRAMER

Chocolate, Lemon, and uh, Cherry. 

BETTE

How about Pineapple? 

KRAMER

Pineapple, sure, alright, I'll be right back. 

KRAMER

Oh, uh, uh. (Leaves) 

ELAINE

Anyway, Mr. Costanza, what I want you to do is to come to the shop with me and tell me what they are saying. You do speak Korean? 

FRANK

I once talked to the reverend Yung Son Moon. He bought two Jesus statues from me. He's a hell of a nice guy. 

ELAINE

uh, ha. 

FRANK

Ever see that face on him? Like a Biiig apple pie. 

ELAINE

Yeah, yeah. Uh, uh listen Mr. Costanza, if uh, if you do this for me I'll get you a manicure, I'll pay for it. Or you can get a pedicure if you want. 

FRANK

No one is touching my feet. Between you and me, Elaine, I think I've got a foot odour problem. 

GEORGE

I watched 'Beaches' on cable last night. ...(wings?) ... Give me a break. 

BETTE

Get some talent then you can mouth off. 

UMPIRE

Strike three. 

BETTE

What? Are you blind? 

UMPIRE

What? 

BETTE

Nothing, nothing. 

FRANK

I had an affair with a Korean woman. 

ELAINE

Uh, Mr. Costanza, I ... 

FRANK

No, I feel I need to unburden myself. I loved her very deeply. But the clash of cultures was too much. Her family would not accept me. 

ELAINE

Mr. Costanza, I, ... 

FRANK

Maybe it was because I refused to take off my shoes. Again, the foot odour problem. Her father would look at me and say, ' eno enoa juang '. Which means, 'this guy - this is not my kind of guy'. 

BETTE

Move it in. Move in everybody. Get your shrimp here. Shrimp on special today! 

JERRY

Come on George, just loosen up. 

JERRY

Come on George. 

KRAMER

I GOT THE PINEAPPLE. : I GOT THE PINEAPPLE. 

JERRY

(to George) Keep going. 

GEORGE

Aaaaaah 

UMPIRE

SAFE! 

GEORGE

come on it's just a game. 

KRAMER

(holding bette) Don't worry Kramer is going to take care of everything. See,, I got you Pineapple. I saw Beaches last night for the fourth time (sings) 'You are the wind...' 

TV

the show will go on but not Bette Midler. While playing softball in the park Ms. Midler was injured when another player thoughtlessly rammed her at home plate. All captured on amateur video tape. She will be out for two weeks from her Broadway show; Rochelle Rochelle - The Musical. 

GENNICE

. . . Thank you. (hugs Jerry and George) 

JERRY

Well we... 

GENNICE

No, please. This is the first time in my life (sobs) that anyone has ever done anything like this for me. I've always had to struggle so hard for everything I ever got. (sobbing) and I know this is going to be my big break. (sobbing) 

JERRY

(with no emotion) It's okay. Everything is going to be all right. 

KRAMER

Come on Jerry, open up. I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE! 

JERRY

Come back another time. 

KRAMER

SO...you're all in here together. How convenient. I hope you're all proud of yourselves. 

KRAMER

So my dear you think you can get to Broadway. Well, let me tell you something. Broadway has no room for people like you. Not the Broadway I know. My Broadway takes people like you and eats them up and spits them out. My Broadway is the Broadway of Merman, and Martin, and Fontaine, and if you think you can build yourself up by knocking other people down... ...GOOD LUCK... (exits) 

ELAINE

Hi everyone. Um, this is my friend, Frank. 

RUBY

What would you like today? Manicure, Pedicure? 

FRANK

I'll take a manicure. I don't take my shoes off for anyone. 

RUBY

'That's the least of his problems.' 

FRANK

What was that? 

ELAINE

What'd they say? What'd they say? 

FRANK

They made a derogatory comment about me. 

RUBY

'She's with a man twice her age.' 'He doesn't look like he's got much money either.' 

LOTUS

'Check out that sweater'. (all laughing) 

RUBY

'I think I saw a moth fly out of a pocket.' 

LOTUS

'What happened to his tail?' 

FRANK

Okay, THAT'S IT! 'oki on awa' Where's my tail? I heard every word you said. You got some nerve. 

KIM

That voice? It sounds so familiar. It reminds me of when I was ayoung girl in Korea and I met an American businessman. He was a very unusual man. Quick temperd with a strange halting way of speaking. We fell in love but when I brought him home to meet my father? He refused to take his shoes off. And there was a terrible fight. 

LOTUS

That man also refuses to take his shoes off. 

FRANK

(from other room) I never seen people treated like this! 

RUBY

You brought in a spy! . . . Get Out! 

KIM

Frank? 

FRANK

Kim? 

KRAMER

(on phone) A turkey sandwich. A side of slaw, ... you want whit e meat or dark? 

BETTE

White meat. 

KRAMER

Yeah, white meat. And if I see one piece of dark meat on there. It's your ass buster. 

BETTE

Get me one of those Black and White cookies. 

KRAMER

yeah, all right, yeah.... (hangs up) They don't have any. But don't worry I'm going to get you one somewhere. 

BETTE

Good. Because if I don't get a Black and White cookie I'm not going to be very pleasant to be around. 

KRAMER

Now that's impossible. 

ELAINE

(sob sob) (bumps into man with an umbrella) ... I don't even know where I'm going. 

PETERMAN

That's the best way to get someplace you've never been. 

ELAINE

yes, (sob) I suppose, ... 

PETERMAN

Have you been crying? 

ELAINE

Yes, (sob) you see this (sob) woman, this manicurist,... 

PETERMAN

Oh no, that doesn't matter now. That's a very nice jacket. 

ELAINE

Uh, (sob) thanks. 

PETERMAN

Very soft, huge button flaps, cargo pockets, draw string waist, deep biswing vents in the back perfect for jumping into a gondola. 

ELAINE

How do you know all that? 

PETERMAN

That's my coat. 

ELAINE

You mean..? 

PETERMAN

Yes, I'm J. Peterman. 

ELAINE

Oh! 

JERRY

I don't know why I have to go to the hospital. I didn't do anything to Bette Midler. Driver can you stop over here, we're picking somebody up. 

GENNICE

Hey, I didn't do anything. I was never informed. ... YOU CAN ALL GO STRAIGHT TO HELL.... You see that? You see what I am going through? 

GEORGE

So what? Somebody dropped an egg on my head as I went into my building last night. 

JERRY

Hey, I'm being heckled on stage. People are yelling out Galloogy. 

GENNICE

I'm having a little trouble with all this. I mean all I ever wanted to do is sing. Now I'm the focus of this big media frenzy. (sob) Nobody in the show will even talk to me. 

JERRY

Stop your crying will ya? 

GENNICE

What? 

GEORGE

You heard him. 

GENNICE

Oh, don't you you're the reason this whole thing happened. 

GEORGE

Oh, yeah. I read what you said to the papers yesterday. You weren't in on the planing. What planning? YOU THINK WE PLANED THIS? Uh? 

CABBIE

Wait. Wait. I know you. You knocked Bette Midler out of Rochelle Rochelle the Musical. I want you creeps out of my cab. 

JERRY

Hey, I had nothing to do with it. 

CABBIE

Get out of my cab. You should go to prison. You should be in prison for the rest of your life. Get out, each of you. Each and every one of you get out of my cab. 

PETERMAN

Then in the distance I heard the bulls. I began running as fast as I could. Fortunately I was wearing my Italian Captoe Oxfords. Sophisticated yet different; nothing to make a huge fuss about. Rich dark brown calfskin leather. Matching leather vent. Men's whole and half sizes 7 through 13. Price $135.00. 

ELAINE

Oh, that's not too expensive. 

PETERMAN

That shirt. Where did you get it? 

ELAINE

Oh, this innocent looking shirt has something which isn't innocent at all. Touchability! Heavy, silky Italian cotton, with a fine almost terrycloth like feeling. Five button placket, relaxed fit, innocence and mayhem at once. 

PETERMAN

That's NOT bad! 

KIM

Oh, Frank. So many years. If only you had taken your shoes off. 

FRANK

I couldn't because I had a potential foot problem. 

KIM

I thought maybe you had a hole in your socks. 

FRANK

I wiped them for two minutes on the mat. I don't know why your father had to make a federal case out of it. 

KIM

Anyway that is all in the past. We have our whole future ahead of us. 

FRANK

Between you and me I think your country is placing a lot of importance on shoe removal. 

KIM

You short stop me? We don't do that in Korea! Take me home. Inever want to see you again. 

KRAMER

Hi, here. I made this for your. (gives her a pasta statue) 

BETTE

... What is it? 

KRAMER

It's macaroni Midler. 

BETTE

Macaroni Midler? 

KRAMER

Yeah, see how you're singing? 

BETTE

... yeah ...ha ha. Well you made a long journey from Milan to Minsk. 

KRAMER

oh, what's that from? 

BETTE

Oh, that's one of the songs from my show. Bette sings: 

KRAMER

Oh You are so freaking talented. 

KRAMER

Oh, so look who's here. What do you want. 

JERRY

We just want to talk to her. We want to apologize and tell her the whole thing was an accident. 

KRAMER

No, no. I'm sorry it's out of the question. 

JERRY

What? 

KRAMER

Bette is recuperating right now and I'm not going to allow anything to disturb her. 

GEORGE

Who are you to decide? 

KRAMER

I'm calling the shots around here so there won't be anymore ACCIDENTS! 

GEORGE

Hey, look, Kramer,... 

KRAMER

AH! I don't want her disturbed. 

RUBY

hello, Elaine. 

ELAINE

Hello 

LOTUS

We're so excited. 

ELAINE

You're welcome. 

RUBY

We'll see you inside. 

JERRY

What happened? 

ELAINE

Well I felt bad about the spying, so you know, ,I got them tickets to the show. 

JERRY

Oh,, that's nice. Alright, I'll see you later. 

ELAINE

Wait, wait. I didn't get to tell you about my new job. 

JERRY

Where? 

ELAINE

Writing for the J. Peterman catalogue. 

JERRY

(pushing her) How did you get that? 

ELAINE

I met him. 

JERRY

You met J. Peterman? 

ELAINE

yeah. 

JERRY

What is he like? 

ELAINE

He wore a classic courtman's duster. beige corduroy collar, 100% cotton canvas, high waist, nine pockets, six on the outside, great for running along side a train, (Jerry walking away) waving last goodbyes, posing on a veranda, Men's sizes ... 

JERRY

(walking away) Yeah, I'll see ya'. 

ELAINE

. . . Small, Medium, Large, XL, Double... 

JERRY

Well, break a leg tonight. 

GENNICE

I'm really nervous. 

STAGEHAND

Here you got a telegram. Well, look who's here. 

JERRY

Listen buddy, 

STAGEHAND

What are you going to do? Break my legs? You don't scare me. You or your goons. 

GENNICE

How do you like this? 

JERRY

What is it? 

GENNICE

My grandmother died. 

JERRY

Oh, I'm so sorry. 

GENNICE

Oh, it's okay, 

JERRY

So you don't cry when your grandmother dies? But a hotdog makes you lose control? 

VOICE

(Off camera) Places everyone. 

GENNICE

I gotta go. 

JERRY

Good luck. 

ANNOUNCER

ladies and gentlemen for this evening's performance the part of Rochelle will be played by Gennice Grant. 

LOTUS

Gennice Glant? 

RUBY

ELAINE

Oh, she got hurt. 

RUBY

No Bette Midler? (they talk Korean and all three leave) 

ELAINE

I, uh, wait,... 

GENNICE

(singing and dancing) 'It's a long journey from Milan to Minsk...' (Shoe lace comes undone (even LOOKS like figure skates) wait wait. Hold it stop, (sob) I'm sorry, I have to start it over, my shoelace. (sob) I can't do it like this. Please let me start over. (sob) Please. (sob) Please. . . .

Well, you got no place to go. I'll tell you what your problem is: You brought your queen out too fast. What do you think? She's one of these feminists looking to get out of the house? No, the queen is old fashioned. . Likes to stay home. Cook. Take care of her man. Make sure he feels good. 

LIZ

Checkmate. 

GEORGE

I don't think we should see each other any more. 

ELAINE

Shut up! Shut up! You stupid mutt. 

JERRY

And you broke up with her 'cuz she beat you at chess? That's pretty sick. 

GEORGE

I don't see how I could perform sexually in a situation after something like that. I was completely emasculated. Anyway, it's not the only reason. 

JERRY

Yeah, what else? 

GEORGE

All right. You wanna know what one of her favorite expressions is? Happy, Pappy? 

JERRY

Happy, Pappy? What does that mean? 

GEORGE

Like if she wants to know if I'm pleased with something, she'll say, 'Happy, Pappy?' 

JERRY

Oh, you're 'Pappy'. 

GEORGE

I'm 'Pappy'. 

JERRY

Oh, I get it. Why don't you just say it? 

GEORGE

Oh, come on. What, are you kidding? GEORGE: I'm much more comfortable criticizing people behind there backs. Anyway, look who's talking. You just broke up with with Melanie last week because she 'shuushed you' while you were watching TV. 

JERRY

Hey, I got a real thing about 'shushing'! 

GEORGE

What is this? Did you ever get the feeling like you've had a haircut but you didn't have one? I'm all itchy back here. 

JERRY

Ahh. 

GEORGE

What? 

JERRY

What is this? What are we doing? What in god's name are we doing? 

GEORGE

What? 

JERRY

OUR LIVES!! . What kind of lives are these? We're like children. We're not men. 

GEORGE

No, we're not. We're not men. 

JERRY

We come up with all these stupid reasons to break up with these women. 

GEORGE

I know. I know. That's what I do. That's what I do. 

JERRY

Are we going to be sitting here when we're sixty like two idiots? 

GEORGE

. We should be having dinner with our sons when we're sixty. 

JERRY

We're pathetic... you know that? 

GEORGE

Yeah, Like I don't know that I'm pathetic. 

JERRY

Why can't I be normal? 

GEORGE

Yes. Me, too. I wanna be normal. Normal. 

JERRY

It would be nice to care about someone. 

GEORGE

Yes. Yes. Care. You know who I think about a lot? Remember SUSAN: ? The one that used to work for NBC? 

JERRY

Hmm. I thought she became a lesbian. 

GEORGE

No. It didn't take. 

JERRY

Oh. 

GEORGE

Did I tell you I ran into her last week? Ho-ho, she looked great. 

JERRY

Hmm. 

GEORGE

You thought she was good looking, right? 

JERRY

See, there you go again. What is the difference what I think? 

GEORGE

I was just curious. 

JERRY

Well, this is it. I'm really gonna do something about my life, you know? You know, I think I'm gonna call Melanie again. So what if she shushed me. GEORGE:, I am really gonna make some changes. 

GEORGE

Yes. Changes. 

JERRY

I'm serious about it. 

GEORGE

Think I'M not? 

JERRY

I'm not kidding. 

GEORGE

Me, too. 

JERRY

Melanie, you can shush me at every opportunity. 5? 3? Oh, it was just an expression. All right, well, that's very sweet of you. Okay, I'll call you later. All right, bye. Hey! 

KRAMER

What? 

JERRY

I had a very interesting lunch with GEORGE: Costanza today. 

KRAMER

Really? 

JERRY

We were talking about our lives and we both kind of realized we're kids. We're not men. 

KRAMER

So, then you asked yourselves, 'Isn't there something more to life?' 

JERRY

Yes. We did. 

KRAMER

Yeah, well, let me clue you in on something. There isn't. 

JERRY

There isn't? 

KRAMER

Absolutely not. I mean, what are you thinking about, JERRY:? Marriage? Family? 

JERRY

Well... 

KRAMER

They're prisons. Man made prisons. You're doing time. You get up in the morning. She's there. You go to sleep at night. She's there. It's like you gotta ask permission to use the bathroom. Is it all right if I use the bathroom now? 

JERRY

Really? 

KRAMER

Yeah, and you can forget about watching TV while you're eating. 

JERRY

I can? 

KRAMER

Oh, yeah. You know why? Because it's dinner time. And you know what you do at dinner? 

JERRY

What? 

KRAMER

You talk about your day. How was your day today? Did you have a good day today or a bad day today? Well, what kind of day was it? Well, I don't know. How about you? How was your day? 

JERRY

Boy. 

KRAMER

It's sad , Jerry. It's a sad state of affairs.. 

JERRY

I'm glad we had this talk. 

KRAMER

Oh, you have no idea. 

GEORGE

La-la-la... 

KRAMER

Hey. 

JERRY

Hey. 

ELAINE

Three hours of sleep again last night.. Three hours of sleep because of that dog. 

KRAMER

What dog? 

KRAMER

Yeah. What dog? 

ELAINE

This dog in the courtyard across from my bedroom window that never never stops barking.. 

KRAMER

Don't... 

ELAINE

I lost my voice screaming at this thing. I can't sleep. I can't work. I mean, I just moved. I can't move again. What am I gonna do? What? What am I gonna do? 

KRAMER

Well, there is something you can do. 

ELAINE

What? KRAMER:, I'll do anything. 

KRAMER

Well, what if there should be an unfortunate accident? 

JERRY

You're going to rub out the dog? 

KRAMER

No, no. Not me. I just happen to know someone who specializes in exactely these kinds of sticky situations. 

ELAINE

Uh-huh. 

JERRY

What, you're considering this? 

KRAMER

Look, just meet with him. ?????. 

ELAINE

I don't really know why I'm here. Kramer talked me into coming up here. But, obviously, I could never really do anything. 

NEWMAN

Of course. Obviously. 

ELAINE

Uh, so, anyway, I'm sorry for wasting your time. 

NEWMAN

What kind of dog did you say it was? 

ELAINE

Um, I don't know. I've never really seen it. 

NEWMAN

I see many dogs on my mail route. I'll bet there's not one type of mutt or mongrel I haven't run across. 

NEWMAN

If you ask me, they have no business living amongst us. Vile, USELESS BEASTS . . . 

KRAMER

NEWMAN: ! Stop it!! 

NEWMAN

Anyway. 

ELAINE

Yeah. Well um, I was just curious if I were interested in availing myself of your services, um, what exactly would you do? 

NEWMAN

Well, ELAINE:, There's any number of things I could do. But, I can promise you this, though, this vicious beast will never bother you again. So, what's it going to be? 

ELAINE

No, I'm sorry. I can't hurt a dog. I can't hurt a dog. I can't. 

KRAMER

I got it. We'll kidnap him . and we'll drop him off Upstate and this way he won't bother you anymore and he won't get hurt. 

NEWMAN

Yeah, I suppose. 

KRAMER

Huh? 

ELAINE

I'd have to think about it. I doubt it, though. I doubt it. I'll let you know. 

NEWMAN

Of course. Take your time. I be here. 

GEORGE

is still at the pier. His thoughts shift somewhat.] 

GEORGE

La-la-la-la-la-la-la! [flashbacks to Susan] 

ELAINE

All right. Let's do it. 

NEWMAN

Excellent. Excellent. 

JERRY

How come you're eating your peas one at a time? 

MELANIE

I'm sorry. 

SUSAN

Who is it? 

GEORGE

It's GEORGE:. 

SUSAN

GEORGE:? GEORGE:, what is it? 

GEORGE

Will you marry me? 

GEORGE

Ma, guess what! 

COSTANZA

Oh, my god! 

GEORGE

No, it's nothing bad. I'm getting married. 

COSTANZA

You're what? 

GEORGE

I'm getting married? 

COSTANZA

Oh, my god! You're getting married? 

GEORGE

Yes! 

COSTANZA

Oh, I can't believe it. FRANK:, come here. 

FRANK

You come here. 

COSTANZA

Georgie's getting married. 

FRANK

What? 

COSTANZA

Georgie's getting married. 

FRANK

Get the hell out of here. He's getting married? 

COSTANZA

Yes. 

FRANK

To a woman? 

COSTANZA

Of course to a woman. What's she look like? 

FRANK

I'm sure she's pretty gorgeous. 

GEORGE

What difference does it make what she looks like? 

COSTANZA

Is she pretty? 

GEORGE

Yes, she's pretty. What difference does it make? 

COSTANZA

Oh, I'm just curious. 

FRANK

She's not pretty? 

COSTANZA

Let me talk to her. 

GEORGE

She wants to talk to you. 

SUSAN

Uh, hello? 

COSTANZA

Congratulations! 

SUSAN

I just want you to know that I love your son very much. 

COSTANZA

You do? 

SUSAN

Yes. 

COSTANZA

Really? 

SUSAN

Yes. 

COSTANZA

May I ask why? 

FRANK

Okay... 

COSTANZA

Will you stop. I'm on the telephone. 

FRANK

Can I talk to her, please? 

JERRY

Hey! 

KRAMER

Hey! 

JERRY

What are you up to? 

KRAMER

Nothing. 

JERRY

What's the rope for? 

KRAMER

Oh! Well, How do you like that. I got rope. Um, I gotta go. 

JERRY

The dog. You're getting the dog. 

GEORGE

Hey, Kramer, where are you going? 

KRAMER

Out. 

GEORGE

Don't go. Kramer! Come back. I got great news. Well, I did it. 

JERRY

Did what? 

GEORGE

I got engaged. I'm getting married. I asked Susan to marry me. We're getting married this Christmas. 

JERRY

You're getting married? 

GEORGE

Yes! 

JERRY

Oh, my god! 

GEORGE

I'm a man. Jerry, I'm a man. And do you know why? It's because of that talk we had. You were my inspiration. Do you believe it? You. That lunch was the defining moment of my life. 

JERRY

I'm blown away. 

GEORGE

You're blown? 

JERRY

Wow! 

GEORGE

You like that? 

JERRY

And she said 'Yes'? 

GEORGE

It took a couple of hours of convincing. I was persistent. I was just like those guys in the movies. And it worked! She said 'Yes'! I can't believe my luck that she was still available . A beautiful woman like that. You think she's good looking, right? 

JERRY

You're gonna have gorgeous kids. 

GEORGE

Yes. She's got great skin - a rosy glow.. 

JERRY

Pinkish hue? 

GEORGE

Oh, she's got the hue. So, what's going on with you and Melanie? I mean, I know you're not getting married, but uh, things are happening? 

JERRY

Well...actually, we kind of broke up. 

GEORGE

You what? 

JERRY

Well, you know, we were having dinner the other night, and she's got this strangest habit. She eats her peas one at a time. You've never seen anything like it. It takes her an hour to finish them. I mean, we've had dinner other times. I've seen her eat Corn Niblets. But she scooped them. 

GEORGE

. . . she scooped her niblets? 

JERRY

Yes. That's what was so vexing. 

GEORGE

Uh-huh. Uh-huh. What about the pact? 

JERRY

What? 

GEORGE

What happened to the pact? We were both gonna change. We shook hands on a pact. Did you not shake my hand on it uh? 

JERRY

You stuck your hand out, so I shook it. I don't know about a pact. Anyway, you should be happy you're engaged. You're getting married. 

GEORGE

Well, it's not that. I just, you know, I thought that we were both uh... 

JERRY

You thought I was gonna get married? 

GEORGE

Well, maybe not married, but... 

JERRY

I mean, you love Susan, right? 

GEORGE

Yeah. 

JERRY

You want to spend the rest of your life with her 

GEORGE

. . . . . . Yeah. 

JERRY

So? 

GEORGE

Yeah. It doesn't make any difference. 

JERRY

No. So, we're still on to see uh, Firestorm tonight? 

GEORGE

Yeah. 

JERRY

I'll pick you up at your apartment. We'll go to the Eight. 

GEORGE

Yeah. 

JERRY

Hey, wait a second. Wait a second. ! Celebrate! How about some champagne? 

GEORGE

Champagne? 

JERRY

Yes, come on! How often do you get engaged? Come on! 

GEORGE

Okay! Alright! 

JERRY

You know what? No champagne. Anyway. . . I'll see you later. 

GEORGE

Yeah. 

ELAINE

That's it. That's it. Stop right here. 

NEWMAN

All right, give me the rope. 

ELAINE

What? What do you need a rope for? 

NEWMAN

Look, I don't have time to explain every little thing to you. 

ELAINE

I don't know. Now, I'm thinking maybe we shouldn't do this. 

NEWMAN

I knew you'd back out. 

ELAINE

KRAMER:, are we doing a bad thing? 

KRAMER

Well, Look at it this way. We drop the dog off in front of somebody's house in the country. They find it and adopt it. Now the dog is prancing in the fields. Dancing and prancing. Fresh air. . Dandelions. We're doing this dog a huge favor. 

ELAINE

Yeah. That's him. 

NEWMAN

All right. I'm going in. Keep the motor running. 

JERRY

Ready? 

GEORGE

Um, I don't uh, really think I can go. 

JERRY

Oh, how come? 

GEORGE

Well, I didn't really tell Susan about it, and she doesn't really have anything else to do. 

JERRY

Well, she could come. 

GEORGE

Well, she doesn't really want to see Firestorm. 

JERRY

Oh. 

GEORGE

She um, she wants to see The Muted Heart. 

JERRY

Oh, The Muted Heart. Glen Close. Sally Field. Well, that should be good. 

GEORGE

Yeah. see you later. 

JERRY

Hey, wait a second. You know, we could share a cab. They're playing at the same Cineplex. 

SUSAN

George, better get ready. 

GEORGE

I am ready. 

SUSAN

You wearing that shirt?. 

GEORGE

Okay, I guess I'll see you down there. 

JERRY

Yeah. 

GEORGE

Okay. 

ELAINE

What time you got? 

KRAMER

Oh, no. I don't wear a watch. 

ELAINE

What do you do? 

KRAMER

Well, I tell time by the sun. 

ELAINE

How close do you get? 

KRAMER

Well, I can guess within an hour. 

ELAINE

Tsk. Well, I can guess within the hour, and I don't even have to look at the sun. 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

ELAINE

Well, what about at night? What do you do then? 

KRAMER

Well, night's tougher but it's only a couple of hours. 

NEWMAN

Let's go. Let's go. Move! 

KRAMER

You got it? 

NEWMAN

What do you think? Drive. Drive. 

ELAINE

Where is it? Where is it? This? This is the dog? 

NEWMAN

Yep. 

ELAINE

But he's so small. 

NEWMAN

Yeah, but he's a fighter. 

ELAINE

That can't be the dog. Are you sure you got the right one? 

NEWMAN

Look, you said the one in the second courtyard. He was in the second courtyard. 

ELAINE

How could that be the dog? 

KRAMER

Well, get him to bark. 

ELAINE

Yeah. Yeah. I'll know if he barks. 

NEWMAN

All right. Bark. 

ELAINE

Bark. 

NEWMAN

Bark. 

SUSAN

Did you like it? 

GEORGE

Yes, it was very, very good. 

SUSAN

Oh, do you think he'll ever find her again? 

GEORGE

Oh, I sure hope so. 

JERRY

How about when Harrison Ford jumped out of that plane, and he was shooting back at them as he was falling? 

FRIEND

What about that underwater escape? 

JERRY

Oh, man! 

KRAMER

Let's turn the radio on. Maybe there's a news report about it. 

NEWMAN

??????? 

ELAINE

You think we're far enough. 

NEWMAN

We're practically to Monticello. 

KRAMER

Yeah. This looks right. All right. Give me the dog. Okay, boy. This is it. This is your new home. Let go of my shirt. Come on. Let go of my shirt. This shirt is from Rudy's. 

GEORGE

Hello? 

JERRY

Hey, ??? is rerunning the Yankee game. You watching this? 

GEORGE

They are? 

SUSAN

GEORGE:, you coming to bed? I'm taping Mad About You. 

GEORGE

Uh, yeah, I'll be there in a minute. 

JERRY

What was that? 

GEORGE

Uh, nothing. I got to go. 

JERRY

Oh, Mattingly just singled . 

GEORGE

You know, it was really wrong of you to back out on that deal. 

JERRY

I didn't make a deal. I just shook your hand. 

GEORGE

Yeah, Well that's a deal where I come from. 

JERRY

We come from the same place. 

SUSAN

GEORGE:, I'm starting it. 

GEORGE

I got to go. 

LADY

Roxy! Where have you been? We've been worried sick about you. What's this? Hmm. Rudy's. 

ELAINE

No! No! It's impossible. It's impossible. 

ELAINE

I don't know. I don't know how it happened. We were practically in Monticello. I mean, how could that thing have found its way back? There's no way. 

JERRY

Very strange. 

ELAINE

I know. 

JERRY

So, tell me anyway. Who was the BIG mastermind? 

ELAINE

Oh, I can't Jerry. 4I'm sworn to secrecy. 

JERRY

All right. But then I can't tell you the BIG news. 

ELAINE

News? What news? 

JERRY

Sorry! 

ELAINE

What? What? 

JERRY

All right, Elaine but this is beyond news. This is like Pearl Harbor. Or the Kennedy assassination. It's like not even news. It's total shock. 

ELAINE

Oh, come on, Jerry. Please, please, please, please, please! 

JERRY

George Costanza... 

ELAINE

Yeah? 

JERRY

Is getting married! 

ELAINE

Get out! 

KRAMER

Hi. 

COP

You Cosmo Kramer? 

KRAMER

Uh, yes. Yeah. 

COP

You recognize this piece of fabric? 

KRAMER

Oh, yeah, that's... 

COP

What? 

KRAMER

What? 

COP

You're under arrest. 

KRAMER

Arrest? 

COP

I have a receipt for a rental car with your signature. Including a report with some damage to the rear seat. It seems the spring was so compressed it completely collapsed the right side.. 

JERRY

Newman. 

NEWMAN

What took you so long? 

KRAMER

Hey, what do you think they'll do to us? 

NEWMAN

Ah, don't worry about a thing. In twenty minutes that place'll be swarming with mailmen. We'll be back on the street by lunch. 

ELAINE

I gotta make some changes. I'm not a woman. I'm a child. What kind of life is this? 

ELAINE

Hey, good news. My dog problem has been solved. 

JERRY

Really? What happened? 

ELAINE

Well, there's this rabbi in my building. You've met him. Very nice man. 

JERRY

Isn't he the one with the show on cable? 

ELAINE

Yea, yeah, yeah,. So I spoke to him about the dog. He went down. Talked to the owner. She agr4eed to keep the dog inside from now on. 

JERRY

That's great. 

ELAINE

I know. 

JERRY

That looks pretty good. 

ELAINE

He's in. 

JERRY

Hey, say, you know, we haven't even discussed George's engagement yet. 

ELAINE

What's to discuss? 

JERRY

Come on! GEORGE: is getting married! 

ELAINE

Is he happy? 

GEORGE

is coming from the bathroom to sit with his bride-to-be.] 

GEORGE

I will never understand the bathrooms in this country. Why is it that the doors on the stalls do not come all the way down to the floor? 

SUSAN

Well, maybe it's so you can see if there's someone in there. 

GEORGE

Isn't that why we have locks on the doors? 

SUSAN

Well, as a backup system, in case the lock is broken, you can see if it's taken. 

GEORGE

A backup system? We're designing bathroom doors with our legs exposed in anticipation of the locks not working? That's not a system. That's a complete breakdown of the system. 

SUSAN

Can we change the subject, please? 

GEORGE

Why? What's wrong with the subject? This is a bad subject? 

SUSAN

No, fine. If you wanna keep talking about it, we'll talk about it. 

GEORGE

It's not that I want to keep talking about it? just think that the subject should resolve itself based on its own momentum. 

SUSAN

Well, I didn't think that it had any momentum. 

GEORGE

(To himself) How am I gonna do this? I'm engaged to this woman? She doesn't even like me. Change the subject? Toilets were the subject. We don't even share the same interests. 

JERRY

Yeah, he seems pretty happy. 

ELAINE

Well, that's all that counts, I guess. 

JERRY

What's the matter? 

ELAINE

Oh, nothin'. 

JERRY

Well, you don't seem too enthused about the whole thing. 

ELAINE

Well, what do you want me to do? 

JERRY

Well, at least have some reaction to it. 

ELAINE

...Well, I don't. 

JERRY

Maybe you're a little jealous. 

ELAINE

Oh, what? You think I wanna marry George? 

JERRY

No! But maybe you wish it was you who was getting married, not him. 

ELAINE

Oh, please! That is the last thing that I want. 

JERRY

Oh, yeah. Right. 

ELAINE

Yeah, right. 

JERRY

Lainy! 

ELAINE

Jerry! 

JERRY

You don't wanna get married? 

ELAINE

Yeah, that's right. I don't wanna get married. 

JERRY

Oh, come on! 

ELAINE

Oh, you come on. 

JERRY

You're such... 

KRAMER

Oh, hey! 

JERRY

Hey. 

KRAMER

Elaine, listen, I was talking to a friend about this dog business. Do you realize this is gonna be on our permanent records? Are you aware of this? 

ELAINE

Oh, dear. 

KRAMER

It can never be erased. It'll follow us wherever we go for the rest of our lives. I'll never be able to get a job. I mean, doesn't that concern you? Everything I've worked for...down the drain because of one stupid mistake. I mean, aren't we entitled to make one mistake in our lives, Jerry? 

JERRY

We're gonna change the system. 

KRAMER

Yes! 

ELAINE

Well, I could care less. I hope it is on our record. I'm just sorry they didn't lock me up. 

ELAINE

Oh, hello, Rabbi Krischma. 

RABBI

ELAINE:! Always a pleasure to see you. 

ELAINE

Thanks again for taking care of that dog for us. 

RABBI

Elaine, often times in life there are problems, and just as often there are solutions. 

ELAINE

Yeah, I suppose. 

RABBI

Elaine, you don't seem yourself today. You seem, if I may say, troubled. 

ELAINE

No, Rabbi, I'm not myself. 

RABBI

Come upstairs. We'll have a talk. 

JERRY

Hey! 

GEORGE

I want your honest opinion about something. 

JERRY

Have I ever been less than forthright? 

GEORGE

No, you haven't. Well, maybe you have. What do I know. 

JERRY

Yeah, I probably have. Yeah, of course I have. What am I talking about? 

GEORGE

All right. Okay, tell me what you think about this idea: Extend the doors on the toilet stalls at Yankee Stadium all the way to the floor. 

JERRY

Extend the doors on the toilet stalls at Yankee Stadium to the floor ...door comes down. Hides your feet. Yes. I like it. I like it a lot. 

GEORGE

It's good, right? 

JERRY

I think it's fantastic. I think it's a fantastic idea. 

GEORGE

You do? 

JERRY

Yes, I do. 

GEORGE

Well, I told it to Susan before, and she didn't like it. 

JERRY

Hmm. 

GEORGE

Yeah. Not only that, this is what she said to me, 'Can we change the subject?' 

JERRY

See, now that I don't care for. 

GEORGE

Right. I mean, we're on a subject. Why does it have to be changed? 

JERRY

It should resolve of its own volition. 

GEORGE

That's exactly what I said, except I used the word 'momentum'. 

JERRY

Momentum - same thing. 

GEORGE

Same thing. My god, I'm getting married in December, do you know that? 

JERRY

Yeah, I know. 

GEORGE

Well, I don't see how I'm gonna make December. I mean, I need a little more time. I mean, look at me I'm a nervous wreck. My stomach aches. My neck is killing me. I can't turn. Look. Look. 

JERRY

You're turning. 

GEORGE

Nah, it's not a good turn. December. December. Don't you think we should have a little more time just to get to know each other a little. 

JERRY

If you need more time, you should have more time. 

GEORGE

What, you think I could postpone it? 

JERRY

Sure you can. Why not? 

GEORGE

That's allowed? You're allowed to postpone it? 

JERRY

I don't see why not. 

GEORGE

So, I could do that? 

JERRY

Sure, go ahead. 

GEORGE

All right! All right. I'll tell you what. How about this? Got the date; March 21st, the first day of spring. 

JERRY

Spring. Of course. 

GEORGE

Huh? You know? Spring. Rejuvenation. Rebirth. Everything's blooming. All that crap. 

JERRY

Beautiful. 

GEORGE

She's not gonna like it. 

JERRY

No, she's not. 

GEORGE

You know, I think I'm a little bit scared of her. She's five-three, like a hundred pounds. I'm frightened to death of her. 

JERRY

Well, she's a woman. They don't like to be disappointed. 

GEORGE

Especially her. She does not like disappointment. Well, I have to do it. I can't make December. There's no way I can make December. Right? I mean, you can see that, right? I mean, look at me. Look. Look. Can I make December? I can't make December. Right? Look. Look. 

JERRY

Yeah, you'd better shoot for March. 

KRAMER

Hey, hey. 

GEORGE

March 21st. Hey! So, you're gonna back me on this, right? 

JERRY

Oh, all the way. 

GEORGE

You are a good friend. You know what? Even if you killed somebody I wouldn't turn you in. 

JERRY

Is that so? 

JERRY

Hey, Kramer if I killed somebody would you turn me in? 

KRAMER

Definitely. 

JERRY

You're kidding? 

KRAMER

No, no, I would turn you in. 

JERRY

You would turn me in? 

KRAMER

Phwap, I wouldn't even think about it. 

JERRY

I can't believe your a friend of mine. 

KRAMER

What kind of person are you going around killing people? 

JERRY

Well, I am sure I had a good reason. 

KRAMER

Well,, if you'll kill this person, who's to say I wouldn't be next? 

JERRY

But you know me! 

KRAMER

I thought I DID! 

ELAINE

I'm not a very religious person but I do feel as if I'm in need of some guidance here. 

RABBI

Would you care for a snack of some kind? I have the Snackwells which are very popular but I think that sometimes with the so called fat free cookies people may overindulge forgetting they may be high in calories 

ELAINE

Thank you I am not very hungry. Anyway, um, this friend of mine, George, got engaged . 

RABBI

How wonderful. 

ELAINE

Yeah, yeah, well, for some reason, um, I just find myself just overcome with feelings of jealousy and resentment. 

RABBI

Doesn't it give you any joy to see your friend enter into this holiest of unions? 

ELAINE

No, no, no it doesn't. No joy no joy whatsoever. Just the whole think makes me . . sick. 

RABBI

You know, Elaine, very often we cannot see the forest for the trees. 

ELAINE

Yeah, I don't know what that means. 

RABBI

Well, for example, say there's a forest, . . . 

ELAINE

You see the thing is we It should have been me. You know, I'm smart. I'm attractive. 

RABBI

You know my temple has many single functions. 

ELAINE

No, no, it's okay. 

RABBI

My nephew Alex is someone who is also looking perhaps ... 

ELAINE

I don't think so. 

RABBI

He owns a flower store. Very successful. 

JERRY

So you're nothing but a stoolie. Admit it. 

KRAMER

Hey, don't do the crime if you can't do the time. 

JERRY

Another Caf&eacute; Latte? 

KRAMER

You better believe it. 

KRAMER

Since when are you so trendy? 

JERRY

Hey, baby. I set the trends. Who do you think started this whole Caf&eacute; Latte? 

JERRY

I don't recall you drinking Caf&eacute; Latte. 

KRAMER

I've been drinking Caf&eacute; Latte since the fifth grade and I haven't looked back. 

JERRY

Hey, Planet 9 From Outer Space is playing tomorrow night. One show only. 

KRAMER

I've always wanted to see this. 

JERRY

You know I was supposed to see this five years ago. I was in a Chinese restaurant with George and Elaine and got all screwed up trying to get a table and I missed it. 

KRAMER

Well, yeah, lets do it uh? 

JERRY

Look at this Jerry, dropping paper on the ground. That's littering. 

JERRY

Maybe you better call the cops and turn me in. 

KRAMER

Maybe I will. 

GEORGE

Hi, 

SUSAN

How was your day? 

GEORGE

Good, good day. How was your day? 

SUSAN

Mine was okay. So what's goin' on? 

GEORGE

Oh, nothin' much. I went over to jerry's, uh, talked to Jerry. 

SUSAN

Oh, the Lowers want to get together with us on Friday night. 

GEORGE

The Lowers, really? 

SUSAN

You don't want to go? 

GEORGE

No, I want to go. 

SUSAN

So what did Jerry have to say? 

GEORGE

Oh, nothin' much, . . . talkin'. . . . Oh, oh, oh, did I have an unbelievable idea today! 

SUSAN

Oh, yeah, the toilets. You told me. 

GEORGE

Yeah, ha ha, It's not the toilets, it's not the toilets. It's something else. Are you ready for this? 

SUSAN

Yeah. 

GEORGE

Okay, how about this? All right, we get married March 21st, the first day of Spring. 

SUSAN

What do you mean? You want to postpone the wedding? 

GEORGE

No, no no it's not about postponing. I just think the first day of Spring is the perfect day to get married. You know, Spring! Rejuvenation! Rebirth! Everything is blooming all the ... 

SUSAN

If you don't want to marry me, George, just say so. (crying) Say so. 

GEORGE

Still marry , still marry. 

SUSAN

You don't love me. 

GEORGE

Sstill love. Still love. 

SUSAN

My parents told me you were too neurotic and that I was making a mistake. 

GEORGE

No no no, no mistake, no mistake. No, no , listen, we're going to get married over Christmas, I ...It doesn't make any difference to me. It's fine. Really. 

SUSAN

Are you sure? 

GEORGE

Yeah, yeah, sure, Christmas. Snow. Santa. All that stuff. 

JERRY

Let me take a guess. She cried and you caved. 

GEORGE

How did you know that? 

JERRY

I live and breath my friend. . . . I live and breath. 

GEORGE

I got to tell you I felt terrible. I really thought she was going to collapse and kill herself. 

JERRY

tes, it's very difficult. Few men have the constitution for it. That's why breakups take two or three tries. You gotta build up your immunity. 

GEORGE

You see those tears streaming down you don't know what to do. It was like she was on fire and I was trying to put her out. 

JERRY

Well, at least you probably had some, uh, pretty good make-up sex after. 

GEORGE

I didn't have any sex. 

JERRY

You didn't have make-up sex? How could you not have make-up sex? I mean that's the best feature of the heavy relationship. 

GEORGE

I didn't have make-up sex. 

JERRY

In your situation the only sex you're going to have better than make-up sex is if you're dent to prison and you have a conjugal visit. 

GEORGE

Yeah, conjugal visit sex. That is happening! 

WOMAN

(crying) 

MAN

I can tell you're very upset but I'm sorry I'm not goin' 

GEORGE

Did you here that? I can't believe this he's eating his sandwich. 

MAN

Are you going to eat thoise fries? 

GEORGE

This is amazing. (George gets up to leave and shake's man's hand) Thank you. Thank you very much. . . . I'm going back in! . . . You'll feel better (to woman) 

JERRY

. . . Poor bastard. 

JERRY

Good evening, Rabbi. 

RABBI

Good evening. And how does this evening find you? 

JERRY

Well, Rabbi, well. 

RABBI

I trust you are here to see your friend, Elaine. 

JERRY

Yeah, that's right. 

RABBI

I hope she's feeling better. 

JERRY

What do you mean? 

RABBI

She didn't tell you? 

JERRY

No. 

RABBI

Well it seems the engagement of her ffriend George has left her feeling bitter and hostile. 

JERRY

is that so? 

RABBI

Yes, in fact she told me that she wishes she was the one getting married. 

JERRY

Really? 

RABBI

She came off as pretty desperate. 

JERRY

I didn't know any of this. 

RABBI

Apparently she doesn't think much of this George fellow either. I recall the word loser peppered throughout her conversation. 

JERRY

Hum, well it all comes as news to me. 

GEORGE

(enters) Hi. 

SUSAN

Hi, how was your day? 

GEORGE

Good, good day. How was your day? 

SUSAN

Ah, it was okay. What's going on? 

GEORGE

Oh, nothing much. You know, I went over to Jerry's. Talked to Jerry. Um, could I talk to you for a minute? 

SUSAN

Yeah, sure. 

GEORGE

You see this is the thing. . . . (crying) I just feel . . . mumble, cry, mumble, . . . I'm scared. You and I together, (cry) 

SUSAN

George, of course, of course it can wait until march if that is what you want. 

GEORGE

Yeah? 

SUSAN

Oh, don't worry your head. Of course. 

GEORGE

All right. (smiles behind her back) 

ELAINE

I've got that magazine article for you. 

JERRY

You iknow I talked to the rabbi outside. 

ELAINE

Are you 

JERRY

Understand you had a little talk with him too. 

ELAINE

Yeah, talked earlier. 

JERRY

Yes I know, I know. 

JERRY

Nothing, nothing. 

ELAINE

He didn't mention . . . 

JERRY

Yes he did. 

ELAINE

He told you about our conversation? 

JERRY

We had quite a little chat. 

ELAINE

He told you about . . . 

JERRY

Yes, about how you're very jealous of George. How you wished it was you who were getting married instead of him. 

ELAINE

He told you all that? How could he? 

JERRY

It didn't take much prodding either, I must say. 

ELAINE

Can he do that? 

JERRY

He did it. 

ELAINE

But he's a Rabbi! How can a Rabbi have such a big mouth? 

JERRY

That's what's so fascinating. 

JERRY

You better finish your little caf&eacute; latte there. They won't let you in with it. 

KRAMER

Why not? 

JERRY

Because they don't allow outside drinks into the movie. 

KRAMER

Well that's stupid 

JERRY

That's the rule. 

KRAMER

Well, we'll just see if we can't get around that. 

RABBI

Oh, Elaine. Come in. Come in. So nice to see you again. 

ELAINE

Yeah... 

RABBI

Can I offere you some Kasha Varnishkas? 

ELAINE

No, no. Listen, Rabbi, I'd like to ask you a question. Why, why did you tell my friend Jerry what I talked to you about? 

RABBI

Was that a problem for you? 

ELAINE

Of course it was a problem for me. . . . You didn't, you didn't tell anyone else about this, did you? 

RABBI

Well, let's see? I seem to recall a conversation with Mrs. Winston in 1F. 

ELAINE

Mrs. Winston? 

RABBI

Yes, we were waiting for our mail to arrive and I happened to mention to her how you felt that it was never going 'to happen' for you. 

ELAINE

What about Don Ramsey? You didn't mention anything to him did you? 

RABBI

Don Ramsey? 

ELAINE

You know that tall really good looking guy, he lives on the fifth floor. 

RABBI

Oh him! Well this morning I found myself in the elevator with him... 

ELAINE

my god, you didn't. 

JERRY

Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me 

KRAMER

Oh, yow, oow Ah! 

USHER

Hey, hey, what's going on? What just happened here? 

KRAMER

Nothing Nothing. 

USHER

Whatya got? One of those Caf&eacute; Latte's in your shirt? 

KRAMER

I don't have anything. Ask him. 

USHER

All right, come on Coffee Boy, bring it out. 

KRAMER

What?! 

USHER

Here you go. 

KRAMER

Ow 

ELAINE

But the whole thing is a mess. He told everyone in the building. I met that cute guy on the fifth floor. I mean he could barely bring himself to nod. 

JERRY

Elaine, if I could say a word here about Jewish people. That man in no way represents our ability to take in a nice piece of juicy gossip and keep it to ourselves. 

ELAINE

You didn't say this to George, did you? 

JERRY

No, . . . about how you wish it was YOU who was getting married instead of him? Feelings of resentment, hostility? 

ELAINE

Yeah that! So, . . . 

GEORGE

Hey oh. 

ELAINE

GEORGIE! CONGRATULATIONS! Oh, my god. I haven't seen you since it happened. I'm so happy for you. 

GEORGE

Alright, thanks a lot. 

ELAINE

Oh, come on. You really, really deserve it. 

GEORGE

Oh, deserve! I don't know if I deserve...I mean... 

ELAINE

Are you kidding? I have seen the changes in you the past couple of years. Man, you have grown. You've matured. 

GEORGE

Well, I guess I'm getting older. 

ELAINE

Oh! Well, I just think it's wonderful. Honestly! I've gotta run, but um, please, please give my best to Susan. 

GEORGE

Yeah. 

ELAINE

My most, just heartfelt congratulations. 

GEORGE

Yeah. Thanks. Hey, listen, if you ever get a date, maybe the four of us could go out together sometime. 

ELAINE

Yes! Yes, yes. Sure. 

GEORGE

Wait, as a matter of fact, wasn't there some guy in your building that you said you liked? He lived up on the fifth floor or something. 

ELAINE

Yes. Yes, yes. Yes. 

GEORGE

Yeah! Boy, she is something, isn't she? 

JERRY

Yeah, she's something else. Hey, so what happened? Did you hold your ground or...uh... 

GEORGE

Nope. I wept like a baby. 

JERRY

What? 

GEORGE

Well, I started to tell her and then all of the sudden, for some reason, I just burst into tears. 

JERRY

You cried? 

GEORGE

I bawled uncontrollably. I just poured my guts out. And I'll tell you, Jerry, it was incredible. I never realized how powerful these tears are. I could have postponed it another five years if I wanted to. 

KRAMER

Hey! 

JERRY

Sorry about that movie-thing. I was joking around. 

KRAMER

Sorry? Are you kidding? You did me the biggest favor of my life. I spoke to a lawyer, we're suing for millions. 

JERRY

Suing? What for? 

KRAMER

The coffee was too hot. 

JERRY

It's supposed to be hot. 

KRAMER

Not THAT hot. 

RABBI

(On TV) The prophet Isaah tells us without friends our lives are empty and meaningless. 

GEORGE

Wait. Whoa! That's the Rabbi from Elaine's building. I just met this guy the other day. 

RABBI

A young lady I know, let's call her Elaine, happened to find herself overwhelmed with feelings of resentment and hostility for her friend, let's call him George. She felt that George was somewhat of a loser and that she was the one who deserved to be married first. She also happened to mention to me that her friend had wondered if going to a prostitute while you're engaged is considered cheating. His feeling was they're never going to see each other again so what's the difference. But that is a subject for another sermon. Now, I'd like to close with a psalm. 

GEORGE

And then I hear this rabbi on television, I mean imagine. 

ELAINE

I'm really sorry George, I, I, I wasn't jealous of you. It was just the whole marriage thing. 

GEORGE

Ya know, I was just a little surprised. 

JERRY

Why would anyone eat canned fruit? I mean can anybody answer that? 

GEORGE

What about all the loser stuff? 

ELAINE

I don't know where the rabbi got that. Ya know I never said that. I said 'I've never seen you looser'. 

JERRY

I can see the can if you're in the army, but fresh fruit it's available, it's there, it's 2 aisles over. 

GEORGE

(Gets up to leave) Well, scintillating as always. 

JERRY

Where you going? 

GEORGE

I'm going shopping with Susan. 

ELAINE

What kind of shopping? 

GEORGE

Clothes shopping. 

ELAINE

Where are you going? 

GEORGE

Ross'. 

ELAINE

Oh that's a nice store. 

GEORGE

Yeah, it's her uncle's. 

JERRY

Discount? 

GEORGE

(As he leaves) One would hope. 

KRAMER

So ya know, my friend and I we were going to the movies and we stopped off and bought this cafe latte. 

JACKIE

(Agreeing) Hm Hm. Oh what is that like Italian coffee? 

KRAMER

Yeah that's right. 

JACKIE

Half milk, half coffee? 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

JACKIE

Hm Hm. You take a sip? 

KRAMER

Yes I did. 

JACKIE

Now when you took a sip, did you notice it was hot? Were you able to sip it in your normal fashion? 

KRAMER

No I wasn't able to sip it in my normal fashion. 

JACKIE

Hm Hm. All right, all right. You take big sips? 

KRAMER

Well I think I take a normal sip. 

JACKIE

O.K. You take normal sips. Nothing wrong with that. Then what happened? 

KRAMER

Well you know ahh, they don't allow outside drinks in the movie theater. So I had to put it in my shirt and sneak it in. 

JACKIE

Yeah, see they like to sell their own coffee. 

KRAMER

Yeah, now is that going to be a problem? 

JACKIE

Yeah that's going to be a problem. It's gonna be a problem for them. This a clear violation of your rights as a consumer. It's an infringement on your constitutional rights. It's outrageous, egregious, preposterous. 

KRAMER

It's definitely preposterous. 

JACKIE

So. Then what happened? 

KRAMER

Well ahh. I was trying to get to my seat and I had to step over someone and I kind of got pushed and it spilled on me. 

JACKIE

Was there a top on it? 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

JACKIE

Now did you put the top on or did they put the top on for you? 

KRAMER

No. They put the top on. 

JACKIE

And they made the top. You didn't make the top did you? 

JACKIE

(To secretary over intercom) Suzie. I want you to go down to Java World. Get me a cafe latte with a top. (To Kramer) We're gonna run some test on that top. Have you been to the doctor? 

KRAMER

Ah No no, I haven't. 

JACKIE

(To secretary over intercom) Suzie. Call Dr. Bison. Set up an appointment for Mr. Kramer here. Tell him it's from me. 

KRAMER

So ah, what do you think Mr. Chiles. 

JACKIE

Jackie. 

KRAMER

Jackie. I mean, we have a chance? 

JACKIE

Do we have a chance? You get me one coffee drinker on that jury, you gonna walk outta there a rich man. 

GEORGE

I don't like it, it's red. It it's too flashy. 

SUSAN

Well you could use a little flash. 

GEORGE

All right. Don't change me. Susan. Don't change me. Ya know there are a lot of woman that would love to be in your position right now. 

SUSAN

Name one. 

ROSS

So, you find anything? 

SUSAN

Oh, he's impossible to shop for uncle Ned. 

ROSS

I'm going on vacation to Costa Rica. Maybe I'll see you in a couple of weeks. 

SUSAN

O.K. 

SALESMAN

Excuse me Mr Ross. 

GEORGE

See now this I don't get. 

SUSAN

What? 

GEORGE

The security guard. 

SUSAN

What about him? 

GEORGE

Why does he have to stand? 

SUSAN

Because he's a security guard. 

GEORGE

But I mean look at him. He's gotta be on his feet like that all day? That's brutal. I think I'm gonna say something to your uncle. 

SUSAN

George, you just met him. Don't say anything to him. 

GEORGE

Aren't you concerned about the security guard? 

SUSAN

Not really. (Walks away) 

GEORGE

(Thinking to himself) She's not concerned about the security guard. What kind of a person is this? I'm marrying a person who doesn't care that this man has to stand here 8 hours a day when he could easily be sitting. 

SUSAN

All right George. (She puts the red shirt up to him again) What do you think? 

JERRY

So ah, what did you do last night? 

ELAINE

Nothing. 

JERRY

I know nothing, but what did you actually do? 

ELAINE

Literally nothing. I sat in a chair and I stared. 

JERRY

Wow. That really is nothing. 

ELAINE

I told ya. 

KRAMER

Hey. 

JERRY

Hey. 

ELAINE

Hey. 

JERRY

What are you all dressed up for? 

KRAMER

Oh I ah just came from a meeting with my lawyer. 

JERRY

Oh yeah, how's that looking? 

KRAMER

Oh I'll tell you how it's looking. My lawyer Jackie says if there is one coffee drinker on that jury, (in a very high voice) I'm gonna be a rich man. 

ELAINE

That's despicable. How does he know how all coffee drinkers will vote? I'm a coffee drinker. If I was on that jury I wouldn't give you a nickel Kramer. 

KRAMER

Yeah, well you wouldn't be on that jury. He would have weeded you out. 

JERRY

Frankly I'm surprised you're so litigious. 

KRAMER

Oh I can be quite litigious. 

ELAINE

What I mean who ever heard of this anyway? Suing a company because there coffee is too hot? Coffee is supposed to be hot. 

KRAMER

Yeah but Jackie says the top was faulty. 

ELAINE

(Mocking) Jackie says the top was faulty. 

KRAMER

Hey Maestro! 

MAESTRO

Ah, Kramer. 

KRAMER

I'm in here. How's it going. 

MAESTRO

Fine. 

JERRY

Hi Bob. 

JERRY

(Apologetically) Oh, I'm sorry. Maestro. 

KRAMER

Well, this is a surprise ha? 

MAESTRO

I just wanted to drop off this Chinese balm for your burns. It's supposed to be great stuff. It's all herbal. 

KRAMER

Oh Maestro, you, what are you doing? You don't have to do this. Do you believe this Maestro? 

MAESTRO

It's nothing. 

KRAMER

Yeah, ya know you haven't been around for a while. 

MAESTRO

Oh yeah, I've been at my house in Tuscany. 

KRAMER

Oh Tuscany huh? Hear that Jerry? That's in Italy. 

JERRY

I hear it's ah beautiful there. 

MAESTRO

Well if you're thinking of getting a place there don't bother. There's really nothing available. 

JERRY

(Surprised) Huh? 

MAESTRO

(Seeing Elaine) Oh! 

ELAINE

Hello. 

MAESTRO

Well Hello. And who might you be? 

ELAINE

I might be Elaine. 

JERRY

This is a, Bob Cobb. 

KRAMER

Maestro. 

ELAINE

Oh, Maestro. 

MAESTRO

It is my very great pleasure. (Kisses Elaine's hand) 

ELAINE

Enchante. 

ELAINE

Well I have to be going. 

ELAINE

Jinx buy me a coke. 

MAESTRO

Oh. Love it when that happeneds. 

ELAINE

I know I know. That is so ahh ...... 

MAESTRO

Coincidental. 

ELAINE

Yeah, thanks. O.K. Bye you guys. 

MAESTRO

Ciao. 

KRAMER

Yeah, yeah oh hey and a thanks for the balm. Yeah. 

KRAMER

You know you hurt the Maestro's feelings. 

JERRY

Oh what, because I didn't call him Maestro? 

KRAMER

That's right. 

JERRY

Ya know I feel a little funny calling somebody Maestro. 

KRAMER

Why? 

JERRY

Because it's a stupid thing to be called. 

KRAMER

Jerry he's a conductor. 

JERRY

Oh conductor. He conducts the Policeman's Benevolent Association Orchestra. 

KRAMER

Well, he's still a conductor. 

JERRY

Well he sure worked pretty fast with Elaine. 

KRAMER

Oh, you should see him do 'Flight of the Bumble Bee'. 

JERRY

New shirt? 

GEORGE

Yeah. You like it. 

JERRY

No, not particularly. 

GEORGE

Why, the color? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

GEORGE

Too flashy? 

JERRY

Yeah, it's burning my retina. Susan picked that out for you right? 

GEORGE

(Obviously lying) No. 

JERRY

(Reaches for a menu) All right what's it going to be here. 

GEORGE

Let me ask you something. When you go into a store, does it bother you that they make the security guard just stand there all day? 

JERRY

No. 

GEORGE

See, didn't bother Susan either. That's why I'm different. I can sense the slightest human suffering. 

JERRY

Are you sensing anything right now? 

GEORGE

Let me just say this. It is inhumane to make a man stand on his feet, in one spot for eight hours a day. Why shouldn't he have a chair? 

JERRY

Well, what about criminal activity? He's got to be alert. 

GEORGE

What, he can't jump out of the chair? How long does that take? Here look at this. (he moves to the end of the booth) Here, watch. (stands up) Criminals. Boom. I'm up. (pretends he's shooting) Stop It! Stop It! Stop It! 

JERRY

Maybe they offered him a chair and he turned it down. 

GEORGE

Would you get out of here. Who's gonna turn down a chair? I would be very interested to know how he felt about all of this. Maybe I'll have a talk with him. 

JERRY

I know you will. 

KRAMER

Hey, hey, hey, listen to this. Jackie just called. 

GEORGE

Who? 

JERRY

His lawyer. 

KRAMER

Yeah, Java World wants to settle. 

JERRY

What? 

KRAMER

Yeah, I'm gonna be rich. 

JERRY

Why are they settling? 

KRAMER

Cause their afraid of bad publicity. 

JERRY

All this because you spilled coffee on yourself? 

KRAMER

Yeah that's right. 

GEORGE

(Very loud in the direction of a waiter) I'm gonna need a coffee here. Very hot! Boiling! 

MAESTRO

And then about four years ago I was on holiday in Tuscany. 

ELAINE

Uh ha. 

MAESTRO

And I fell in love with this house. 

WAITER

Are you ready to order? 

ELAINE

Oh God. What are you getting Bob? 

MAESTRO

Good question. (to waiter) We'll need a few minutes. 

MAESTRO

You know, I'm sorry but, I didn't mention it earlier but actually I preferred to be called Maestro. 

ELAINE

Excuse me? 

MAESTRO

Well, ya know I am a conductor. 

ELAINE

Yeah, so? 

MAESTRO

Oh I suppose it's O.K. for Leonard Burnstein to be called Maestro because he conducted the New York Philharmonic. So he gets to be called Maestro and I don't. 

ELAINE

Well, I mean don't you think that he was probably called Maestro while he was conducting, not in social situations. I mean his friends probably just called him Lenny. 

MAESTRO

I happen to know for a fact, that he was called Maestro in social situations. I once saw him at a bar and someone came up to him and said 'Hello Maestro, how about a beer'. O.K. So that's a fact. 

ELAINE

Maestro huh? O.K. (laughing) 

KRAMER

Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry my burn is gone look.(shows Jerry the burn area). 

JERRY

What do you mean? 

KRAMER

Well I put that Chinese balm on that the Maestro gave me. And look, it healed it. 

JERRY

So? 

KRAMER

So? My lawsuit. I'm finished. 

JERRY

I thought they wanted to settle. 

KRAMER

Well what happens if they want to see it? 

JERRY

Then you're in a lot of trouble. 

KRAMER

Yeah!! 

GEORGE

(To guard) Tired? 

GUARD

No. 

GEORGE

How come uh, no chair? 

GUARD

What? 

GEORGE

I, I couldn't help but notice that uh you don't have a chair. 

GUARD

I don't need a chair. 

GEORGE

No I didn't mean to imply that you did. You're obviously a very well proportioned individual. I was just wondering, have they ever offered you a chair? 

GUARD

Nope. 

GEORGE

Would you like a chair? 

GUARD

I suppose if they gave me one I'd sit down. 

GEORGE

Ah ha, Ah ha. You would, wouldn't you? 

GUARD

Obviously I'd rather sit than stand, if that's what your asking. 

GEORGE

That's exactly my point. 

GUARD

Well who wouldn't? 

GEORGE

Cause I tell you, frankly, I would like to walk in hear one day and find you sitting down. (Starts to walk out of the store) That would give me a lot of pleasure. Call me crazy. 

JACKIE

You put the balm on? Who told you to put the balm on? I didn't tell you to put the balm on. Why'd you put the balm on? You haven't even been to see the doctor. If your gonna put a balm on, let a doctor put a balm on. 

KRAMER

I guess I screwed up huh Jackie? 

JACKIE

Your damn right you screwed up. Where the hell did you get that damm balm anyway? 

KRAMER

The Maestro. 

JACKIE

The who? What are you talking about Maestro? 

KRAMER

My friend he's a conductor. 

JACKIE

Oh oh oh, so a Maestro tells you to put a balm on and you do it? 

KRAMER

Well my stomach was burning. 

JACKIE

I tell you what this is. This is a public humiliation. 

KRAMER

Well I didn't know the balm was gonna work. 

JACKIE

Do you know what a balm is? Have you ever seen a balm? Didn't you read the instructions? 

KRAMER

Well I ... 

JACKIE

(interrupts) No one can tell what a balm's gonna do. They're unpredictable. 

KRAMER

I'm sorry Jackie. 

JACKIE

(To cab driver) Pull over here driver this is it. 

KRAMER

(Motions with his head) Yeah, get over. 

JERRY

Did you have a good time? 

ELAINE

Yeah, he's very interesting. Did you know that Mozart died while he was writing 'The Requiem'. 

JERRY

(Sarcastically) Yeah, everyone knows that, it was in Amadeus. 

ELAINE

Really? 

JERRY

So what about the 'Maestro' stuff. Did he make you call him Maestro. 

ELAINE

Yeah, I called him Maestro. 

JERRY

You didn't mind? 

ELAINE

Well, I did at first, but actually I kind of got used to it. 

JERRY

O.K. from now on I want you to call me 'Jerry the Great'. 

ELAINE

I am not calling you 'Jerry the Great'. 

JERRY

Why not you call him Maestro. 

ELAINE

He is a Maestro. 

JERRY

Well, I'm great. 

ELAINE

So you say. 

JERRY

What about his house in Tuscany, he mention that? 

ELAINE

Yeah. (bragging) I'm invited. 

JERRY

You know when I told him it was beautiful there, out of the clear blue sky he says there's nothing to rent. As if he doesn't want anyone else there. 

ELAINE

Why? 

JERRY

I don't know. Maybe he's embarrassed by Americans. 

ELAINE

Yeah, well maybe there aren't any houses to rent there. 

JERRY

In all of Tuscany? I wonder. 

STAR

I say we offer him $50,000 that's it, take it or leave it. 

BURNS

How do we know how severe the burns are? Why don't we have him examined by a doctor. 

JORDAN

Listen, the faster we dispose of this the better. This thing gets into the paper it will kill us. 

STAR

All right, we'll start at 50,000 and free coffee at all of our stores. 

STAR

(Answering secretary) Yes? 

SECRETARY

Mr. Chiles and Mr. Kramer are here. 

STAR

Send them in. 

STAR

Gentleman. 

STAR

Gentleman come in. Now we don't want to take up much of your time. Let's make this short and sweet. We're prepared to offer you all the free coffee you want in any of our stores throughout North America and Europe, Plus.. 

KRAMER

(Interrupting) I'LL TAKE IT!! 

JACKIE

I'll take it? Who told you to take it? Did I tell you to take it? 

KRAMER

No. 

JACKIE

I know the Maestro didn't tell you to take it, he wasn't there. 

KRAMER

Well I thought we were lucky to get anything. 

JACKIE

Free coffee? 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

JACKIE

I don't want free coffee. It's not hard to get coffee. I can get my own 

KRAMER

Well I didn't hear any Plus. 

JACKIE

20 years practicing law I've never experienced anything like this. 

KRAMER

Look, Java World. (To cabbie) Hey listen I'm gonna get out here. I'm gonna get myself a free cafe latte. 

ELAINE

Hey. Hi Maestro. 

MAESTRO

Beethoven's 7th. 

ELAINE

Yeah. 

JERRY

Hey you know we were just talking about you. 

MAESTRO

Oh yeah? 

JERRY

Yeah, ya know the other day how you mentioned that there were no houses available in Tuscany? 

MAESTRO

You didn't find one, did you? 

JERRY

No. I'm not really looking. 

MAESTRO

Nor should you. 

JERRY

So are you telling me there's not one house to rent in all of Tuscany? 

MAESTRO

The houses are passed down from generation to generation, it's very hard. 

JERRY

I can't get a sublet, a guest room, a cot, nothing? 

MAESTRO

It's booked solid! 

ELAINE

It's BOOKED Jerry! 

JERRY

How'd you get yours? 

MAESTRO

Got lucky. Come on, Elaine, let's take a ride, I was about to pop in some Verdi. 

JERRY

Maybe I'll check out France. 

JERRY

Hey George, do you believe this guy? 

GEORGE

Who? 

JERRY

Bob Cobb. 

GEORGE

Bob Cobb? 

JERRY

You know, the Maestro. 

GEORGE

Oh I missed the Maestro? 

JERRY

Yeah, get this, he tells me there are no houses any where in Tuscany to rent. 

GEORGE

Huh. Your renting a house in Tuscany? 

JERRY

No. 

GEORGE

So what do you care? 

JERRY

I just wish I could figure out if this guy is trying to keep me out of Tuscany. 

GEORGE

Of course he is. There's got to be houses for rent in Tuscany. Do you know how big Tuscany is? 

JERRY

I have no idea. 

GEORGE

It it's huge. It's probably like North Dakota. 

JERRY

Oh, no way it's that big. 

GEORGE

It's a big region. 

JERRY

Do you know how big North Dakota is stupid? 

GEORGE

I don't know why I bother even talking to you. 

JERRY

Hey, no one's got a gun to your head. 

GEORGE

All right. 

GEORGE

So I spoke to the security guard. 

JERRY

Yeah and? 

GEORGE

Well it's tough to get a good read but I think if I brought him a chair, he'd sit. 

JERRY

So are you gonna get him a chair? 

GEORGE

Yup. It's really just a question of what kind. Thinking about a bar stool. 

JERRY

Yeah, that would give him some height, be able to check things out. With a back or without. 

GEORGE

Oh I think I'd go for the back. 

JERRY

Swivel? 

GEORGE

I suppose he could swivel. Hey maybe one of those director's chairs. What do you think of those. 

JERRY

I thinks it's kind of a pompous look. You know my parents used to have a kitchen chair that would have been perfect. 

GEORGE

You mean one of those vinyl things? 

JERRY

Yes. 

GEORGE

Vinyl yeah, maybe. 

JERRY

How can I figure out if there's any places to rent in Tuscany? Wait a minute. Poppy's from Tuscany. I'm gonna go call him. 

GEORGE

Yeah, good luck. Hey I'll meet you outside. 

JERRY

Poppy told me to talk to his cousin, he lives down in Little Italy. 

GEORGE

What do you think about a rocking chair? 

KRAMER

(Speaking very fast and fidgety) You can't put a limit on my cafe lattes, it says so right here. And I don't want to get dirty looks when I come in here. If I want a cafe latte, you give me a cafe latte. And if I have any problems I'm gonna get my lawyer Jackie Chiles down here and your gonna be in really big trouble. 

JERRY

Hey hey hey, slow down Eddie. What what's the matter? 

KRAMER

Awe there making faces at me cause I've had a couple of cafe lattes. But I'm entitled to them. I can have as many cafe lattes as I want, that was the settlement. 

JERRY

That's it? 

KRAMER

That's it. What you want one George? I can get one for you. No problem. Jerry, you want one? They're delicious. My pleasure. 

JERRY

You've got to stop it. Your your all hopped up on the caffein. 

KRAMER

Well I feel like I'm talking fast but it's very hard to tell. 

JERRY

You're racing! 

KRAMER

Well well I've got things to do. I'll see you later. Bye. 

ELAINE

(Passionately) Oh Bob! Bob! 

ELAINE

(Correcting herself) Maestro! 

CLERK

(Noticing George with the rocking chair) Excuse me. Can I help you? 

GEOGE

Nope. Just a, giving a chair to the security guard. 

CLERK

Did Mr. Ross tell you to do this? 

GEORGE

What's your name? 

CLERK

Evan Fayne. 

GEORGE

I'm engaged to Mr. Ross' niece. I'm probably gonna be taking over this whole place someday so if I were you I would stay on my good side. 

CLERK

I'm terribly sorry, I didn't know. 

GEORGE

Innocent mistake. 

GEORGE

Well, here you go. What do you think? 

GUARD

Mr. Ross says this is O.K.? 

GEORGE

Hey, I'm his nephew, all right? Don't worry about it. Go ahead. Check it out. 

GUARD

Not bad. Not bad at all. 

JERRY

Ah, excuse me, I'm looking for a Mr. Giggio. 

GIGGIO

Si, Si, imma Giggio. 

JERRY

Poppy sent me to see you Mr. Giggio. 

GIGGIO

Si, Si Poppy. 

JERRY

Um, did he did he mention to you why I called? 

GIGGIO

Si, the house in Tuscana. 

JERRY

Yeah, right, right. So is there anything there to rent? 

GIGGIO

Si. Two million lira. You give me the check. 

JERRY

I didn't actually want to rent it. 

GIGGIO

The keys, here are the keys. You give me the check. Two million lira. Seventeen hundred Americana. Molto generoso. 

GIGGIO

(To the man) Si, Si. 

JERRY

So see um, I didn't say that I wanted to rent it, I was just wondering if there were houses there to rent. 

GIGGIO

Si. (hods up the keys) Thissa one!. Capiche? 

ELAINE

It's been a rough couple of weeks, ya know I really needed to get away. 

MAESTRO

I told you, it's paradise. 

ELAINE

You're right Maestro. 

KRAMER

Common Jerry, this guy is crazy. Get out. 

JERRY

You didn't have to push me. 

KRAMER

I didn't push you. How much did you pay that guy? 

JERRY

75,000 lira. 

KRAMER

75,000 lira? Are you out of your mind? 

JERRY

Kramer you don't under the conversion rate. 

KRAMER

Oh, conversion rate, oh. 

JERRY

You know I don't even know why I brought you. 

KRAMER

Nobody put a gun to your head. 

JERRY

Not bad! 

KRAMER

Yeah! 

ELAINE

Hello 

JAMES

This is your wake up service. It's 7:15 

ELAINE

Oh, god. OH, I could use a few more hours sleep. 

JAMES

Hot date last night? 

ELAINE

I wish. 

JAMES

A woman with a sexy voice like yours its hard to believe your waking up alone. 

ELAINE

Really? Thank you., wake up service . . . person. 

JAMES

Call me James. 

ELAINE

Oh, all right, James. He he he 

GEORGE

Your wake up guy asked you out? 

ELAINE

Yeah, I've never seen him but I feel like we have this weirdly intimate relationship. I mean, I'm lying in bed, I'm wearing my nightie, 

JERRY

I don't know. Blind date? 

ELAINE

What? You're going to go out with my cousin Holly. You've never met her. 

JERRY

Yeah, but I've seen pictures of her. 

ELAINE

At least I've spoken to my guy. You're going out on a deaf date. 

JERRY

I think I'd rather go out on a deaf date than a blind date. The question is whether you'd rather date the blind or the deaf. 

ELAINE

Ah, . . . 

GEORGE

Now you're off on a topic. 

JERRY

You know, I think, I would rather date the deaf. 

ELAINE

Uh hu. 

JERRY

Because I think the blind would probably be a little messier around the house. And lets face it they're not going to get all the crumbs. I'd possibly be walking around with a sponge. 

GEORGE

You see I disagree. I'd rather be dating the blind. You know you could let the house go. You could let yourself go. A good looking blind woman doesn't even know you're not good enough for her. 

ELAINE

I think she'd figure it out. 

ELAINE

What? What is this? 

JERRY

Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit. 

ELAINE

Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit? What are you turning into? 

JERRY

A healthy person. 

GEORGE

( rubbing his eye) Ow, Ow you squirted me. 

JERRY

Oh, sorry 

GEORGE

Boy, it stings. 

WILHELM

George, have you seen Morgan? 

GEORGE

No. 

WILHELM

He's been coming in late all week. Is there something wrong? 

GEORGE

No, not that I know of. (winks) 

WILHELM

Really? Make sure he signs this. Oh, look George, if there's a problem with Morgan you can tell me. 

GEORGE

Morgan? No. He's doing a great job. (winks) 

WILHELM

I understand. 

JERRY

I still can't believe, you're going out on a blind date. 

ELAINE

I'm not worried. It sounds like he's really good looking. 

JERRY

You're going by sound? What are we? Whales? 

ELAINE

I think I can tell. 

JERRY

Elaine, what percentage of people would you say are good looking? 

ELAINE

Twenty-five percent. 

JERRY

Twenty-five percent, you say? No way! It's like 4 to 6 percent. It's a twenty to one shot. 

ELAINE

You're way off. 

JERRY

Way off? Have you been to the motor vehicle bureau? It's like a leper colony down there. 

ELAINE

So what you are saying is that 90 to 95 percent of the population is undateable? 

JERRY

UNDATEABLE! 

ELAINE

Then how are all these people getting together? 

JERRY

Alcohol. 

ELAINE

(to George who is winking) What is your problem? 

GEORGE

No problem here. 

ELAINE

You keep winking at me. That's really obnoxious. 

GEORGE

I had no idea. 

ELAINE

Right there. Right there. You just did it again. 

GEORGE

Wait a minute. Wait a minute. It's from that grapefruit that Jerry squirted at me. 

ELAINE

You're eye still hurts? 

GEORGE

Yeah, yeah. You must have squirted a piece of pulp in it too. 

JERRY

Pulp couldn't make it across the table. 

GEORGE

Pulp can move, Baby! Why didn't you eat a real breakfast? 

JERRY

Hey, I eat healthy. If I have to take out an eye, that's the breaks. 

GEORGE

Wait a minute. I must have been winking down at the office. That's why Mr. Wilhelm was acting so mysteriouso. 

ELAINE

What did he think, you were flirtin' with him? 

GEORGE

Hu, oh. No he thought I was hiding something from him about Morgan. 

KRAMER

Hi guys. 

JERRY

Hi, 

KRAMER

Hello Archie, Veronica, Mr. Weatherbee. . . . Is this Don Matingly's signature? 

GEORGE

Yeah. 

KRAMER

And Buck Showalter's? 

GEORGE

It's an inter-office envelope. It get passed around all over the office. 

KRAMER

Um, can I show this to my buddy Stubbs . He runs a sports memorabilia store. He pays top dollar for pro autographs. 

GEORGE

Yeah, like I'm going to risk my job with the New York Yankees to make a few extra bucks. (winks) 

KRAMER

No, of course not. (winks back) 

KRAMER

You know, you see Don Matingly signed this envelope then he sent it to room 318, where it was received and signed for by manager Buck Showalter. 

STEINBRENNER

I don't know. An envelope doesn't really cut it. 

KRAMER

Why? 

STEINBRENNER

What is this? A birthday card. Ha ha . . . signed by the ENTIRE Yankee organization! . . . This could be worth something. 

GEORGE

Is that the lovely Mrs. Morgan? 

MORGAN

Hello. 

MORGAN

Oh, by the way, have you got that birthday card? 

GEORGE

Birthday card? 

MORGAN

Mr. Steinbrenner's birthday card. Wilhem said you had it for me to sign. 

GEORGE

Oh ah, I uh, will have that for you by after lunch. 

MORGAN

Fine. I'll be back after my massage. 

GEORGE

Of course. Your massage. (winks) Enjoy your massage. (winks) 

ELAINE

Hello. 

ELAINE

James! Ah, ha, Hello! Phew! 

HOLLY

I can't believe you've never taken anybody here before. 

JERRY

Well, I'm not really that much of a meat eater. 

HOLLY

. . . You don't eat meat? Are you one of those. . . 

JERRY

Well, no, I'm not one of those. 

HOLLY

When we were little girls Grandma Memma would take us to a matinee and then dinner here. 

JERRY

Grandma Memma? 

HOLLY

Elaine must have mentioned Grandma Memma. 

JERRY

No, I think I would have remembered Memma. 

HOLLY

Oh well, that's typical. Elaine never liked Grandma Memma. 

WAITER

Ready? 

HOLLY

I'll have the porterhouse medium rare, baked potato with sour cream, 

JERRY

What do you recommend besides the steak? 

WAITER

The lamb chops are good. 

JERRY

Anything lighter? How do you prepare the chicken? 

WAITER

It's a full bird. Stuffed with ham, topped with gorganzola. 

JERRY

You know what? I think I'll just have the salad. 

WAITER

. . . Thank you. 

JERRY

(mind's voice) Just a salad? Just a salad? Just a salad? 

JAMES

Hey you, hey you. 

ELAINE

Oh, uh, ha, you've got dogs? 

JAMES

Yeah, you know, when you live alone, you're dogs are all you have. Do you like dogs? 

ELAINE

(mind's voice from - ... ) SHUT UP! YOU STUPID LITTLE MUT ! 

ELAINE

Dogs. Oh I love dogs. 

JAMES

Boys, this is Elaine. . . . Sorry, they're usually very friendly. Hey! 

GEORGE

Hey, Mr. Morgan how was your massage? 

MORGAN

I had to cancel it. For some reason my wife got it into her head that it was more than just a massage. 

GEORGE

Really? 

MORGAN

Yeah, we had this big fight at lunch it looks like tonight I will be sleeping on the couch. 

GEORGE

Hey, listen don't oversleep. You can't afford to be late again. 

MORGAN

I know. Somebody around here has been giving Wilhelm the impression that I have been slacking off. 

GEORGE

Geez, Hey you know something, you should try my friend's wake up service. She swears by this thing. 

MORGAN

Costanza, you may be my only friend around here. By the way, you got that birthday card? 

GEORGE

Ah, not yet. 

MORGAN

Just make sure Steinbrenner doesn't get it until I sign it. 

GEORGE

Yes sir! 

ELAINE

I just don't understand it as soon as I met these dogs they started growling at me. 

JERRY

Maybe his dogs heard about how you tried to kidnap that other dog. These muts like to gossip. So have you talked too Holly? 

ELAINE

Huh huh. 

JERRY

Did she mention anything about our lunch? 

ELAINE

Uh, kind of. 

JERRY

What do you mean, 'kind of.'? 

ELAINE

I mean, she thought it was kind of strange to just order a salad. . . . You know. . . . For a man. 

JERRY

What are you saying? . . . Salad! What was I thinking? Women don't respect salad eaters. 

ELAINE

You got that right. 

JERRY

But you're going over there for dinner tonight, right? 

ELAINE

Um uh. 

JERRY

What is she making? 

ELAINE

I don't know. But I'm sure it had, . . . parents. Call her up. She won't mind if you come. 

JERRY

Oh, don't worry. I'll be there and I'll be packing an artery. 

KRAMER

Ah, Mr. Weatherbee. 

GEORGE

You got the Yankee envelope? 

KRAMER

Sure do. 

GEORGE

oh, 

KRAMER

Here you go. 

GEORGE

Hey, he, 

KRAMER

You'll be pleased to see what's inside. 

GEORGE

What is this? 

KRAMER

You're cut of the loot. Stubs gave me 200 dollars for the autographed birthday card that was inside. 

GEORGE

Who told you to sell the card? 

KRAMER

You did. 

GEORGE

No I didn't! 

KRAMER

No, not in so many words but I believe we had an understanding. (winks) 

GEORGE

I was not winking you idiot. That was the grapefruit. It's like acid. I need that card back. It's Mr. Steinbrenner's. I was responsible. 

KRAMER

Well Stubs has already sold it to some guy who's kid's in the hospital . 

GEORGE

Well get it back! It's very important. (winks) 

KRAMER

Look, do you want me to get it back or not? 

GEORGE

(holds eyes wide open) Get it back! 

ELAINE

Such a lovely table setting. Oh, wear did you get these napkins? 

HOLLY

They're grandma Memma's. 

ELAINE

Oh, I don't remember them. 

HOLLY

Oh, you wouldn't. She only used them on special occasions. 

ELAINE

Special occassions? It wasn't special when my family visited? 

HOLLY

Everybody like mutton? 

JERRY

Um, mutton! Hope you didn't cut the fat off. 

KRAMER

That you Bobby? 

BOBBY

huh 

KRAMER

Well, I heard that you have a very uh, special birthday card .with all the Yankee autographs on it. 

BOBBY

Sure do. Mister. 

KRAMER

Oh, that's it, yeah. Boy, Stubs sure went to town with this thing huh? Yeah, well, Bobby, uh, what if I told you a very important person at the New York Yankees needed this card back. 

BOBBY

Oh, no. I'd never part with this card for anything in the world. 

KRAMER

Well, uh, Bobby, uh, who's your favorite Yankee. 

BOBBY

Paul O'Neill. 

KRAMER

All right. What if I tell Paul O'Neill to hit a home run tomorrow, just for you. 

BOBBY

Would he? Paul O'Neill would do that? 

KRAMER

For you he would. 

BOBBY

Would he hit two home runs? 

KRAMER

Two? Sure kid, yeah. But then you gotta promise you'll do something for me. 

BOBBY

I know. Get out of this bed one day and walk again. 

KRAMER

Yeah, that would be nice. But I really just need this card. 

ELAINE

What about this candelabra? 

HOLLY

Yeah, that was grandma Memma's also. She bought it on her trip to Europe in 1936. Jerry, I'm thrilled you like my mutton. I was afrais you only ate . . . salad. 

JERRY

Hey, salad's got nothin' on this mutton. 

HOLLY

That is so funny. Did you just make that up? 

JERRY

I wish I could take credit for it. It's actually the line my butcher uses when we're chewing the fat. How about that beautiful desk over there? (hides meat in napkin in jacket) 

HOLLY

That was in Grandma's study. 

ELAINE

What did you do, ransack the place after she died? 

JERRY

This is some FINE mutton. 

ELAINE

I'm getting out of here. Can I borrow your jacket? 

JERRY

Uh, well, uh the thing is that . . . (Jerry grabs jacket back) 

ELAINE

It's cold out, and I didn't bring my own. Jerry! God forbid I should borrow one from Holly. It might have belonged to grandma Memma. Thanks for mutton. 

ELAINE

Down boy, nice doggy . I'm a nice person. Don't believe what you hear. 

HOLLY

Where are the napkins? 

JERRY

What? 

HOLLY

Grandma Memma's napkins. There's two missing. Elaine took them didn't she? 

JERRY

I don't know about that. Have you got any floss? 

HOLLY

You heard her. She coveted them. I bet she took them just to spite me. She's probably having a good laugh about it right now. 

ELAINE

Down doggy . oh oh a a a a a 

JERRY

Elaine, what are you doing in this neighborhood? 

ELAINE

Did you do with the dogs? 

JERRY

Yeah, they're in the kitchen. . . . okay, quite! What's going on? 

ELAINE

These dogs were chasing me. And no cab would stop and I had to get off the street. Then I remembered that you lived here. 

JERRY

Why were dogs chasing you? 

ELAINE

They just don't like me. It's a long story. I can tell you one day but I can't tell you right now. 

JERRY

I would askk you to stay tonight but I only have the sofa bed and it's where I sleep. 

ELAINE

We'll have to sleep head to toe. 

JERRY

Head to toe? 

ELAINE

Head to toe. 

ELAINE

Hey, wake up. It's 8:30 you were supposed to walk me up at 7:15. 

JERRY

I'm sorry I didn't get any sleep you kept kicking me in the face. 

ELAINE

You're a wake up guy. Don't you have calls to make? 

JERRY

I'll make them later. Uh. 

WILHELM

Have you seen Morgan? 

GEORGE

He's not here? 

WILHELM

No, He's late. 

GEORGE

It's impossible. I got him a wake up service. 

WILHELM

Now, George, you don't have to cover for him any more. He's going to be gone soon and I'm going to recommend you for his job. 

GEORGE

. . . gone? 

JERRY

It sounds like all the winking got you a promotion. 

GEORGE

I don't want Morgan's job. He's got a lot of work to do. Hey, Elaine, your friend never woke up Mr. Morgan. 

ELAINE

Nah, he was tired. He had some feet in his face. My cousin Holly is completely insane. She keeps calling and accusing me of stealing her napkins. 

GEORGE

Napkins? 

ELAINE

I mean, why? Why would I take her stupid napkins. 

JERRY

Because they were in the pockets of my jacket. 

ELAINE

They were? 

JERRY

Yes. I was using them to spit out the mutton. 

ELAINE

Spit it out? I had dogs chasing me for that mutton. I was almost mauled because of that mutton. 

GEORGE

What exactly is mutton? 

JERRY

I don't know and I didn't want to find out. So where is my jacket? 

ELAINE

Oh, I must have left it at Jame's 

JERRY

You spent the night at James's? Did we? 

ELAINE

Yeah but we reversed positions so there was no funny business. 

JERRY

Reversed positions? 

ELAINE

Yeah, you know, head to toe. 

JERRY

So what your genitals are still lined up. 

ELAINE

No, because I slept with my back to him. 

KRAMER

Mr. O'Neill? 

NEILL

Yeah. 

KRAMER

Yeah, uh, look, you don't know me. 

NEILL

I can give you an autograph there, but my pen's kind of screwed up. You'd only like half a 'P' or something. 

KRAMER

No, it's uh, not that see,. It's about a little boy in a hospital. I was wondering if you could do something to lift his spirits. 

NEILL

Sure, I could help you there. 

KRAMER

Sure, well I promised you would hit him two home runs. 

NEILL

Say what? 

KRAMER

You know, Klick!. A couple of dingers. 

NEILL

You promised a kid in the hospital that I would hit two home runs? 

KRAMER

Yeah, well, no good? 

NEILL

Yeah. That's no good. It's terrible. You don't hit home runs like that. It's hard to hit home runs. And where the heck did you get two from? 

KRAMER

Two is better than one. 

NEILL

That, that's ridiculous. I'm not a home run hitter. 

KRAMER

Well, Babe Ruth did it. 

NEILL

He did not. 

KRAMER

Oh, do you say that Babe Ruth is a liar? 

NEILL

I'm not calling him a liar but he was not stupid enough to promise two. 

KRAMER

Well, maybe I did overextend myself. 

NEILL

How the heck did you get in here anyway? 

JAMES

(on phone) Oh, hi Elaine. You know I lost all of my 6:30 clients because of you. . . . Yeah, well why did you have to stick your feet in my face? . . . Yes, I have the jacket. Hold on. . . . (to dogs) Fellas! 

TV

The Yankees take the field on a beautiful afternoon. 

KRAMER

It's hot in here. Hey, Bobby, can I have some of your juice? 

BOBBY

After Paul O'Neill hits his first home run. 

HOLLY

(from buzzer) It's Holly. 

JERRY

Yeah. Come on up. 

TV

And the two and one pitch to O'Neill. A towering shot back to deep right field and it's gone. 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

TV

A home run for Paul O'Neill. The Yanks lead one nothing. 

KRAMER

OH YEAH! ALL RIGHT! 

BOBBY

One more to go. 

JERRY

Hey. What's all this? 

HOLLY

I decided I was going to make you dinner. 

JERRY

I thought we were going out. 

HOLLY

Well, after you scarfed up my mutton I had the irresistible urge to make pork chops for you. I said hello to Franco for you. 

JERRY

Franco? 

HOLLY

Your butcher, down the street. 

JERRY

I bet he acted aloof like he didn't know me. 

HOLLY

A little. 

JERRY

That is so Franco. 

TV

Bottom of the eighth, score tied at one apiece. Two and one to Paul O'Neill. 

KRAMER

You know Bobby, it's very very hard to hit two home runs in one game. Even for Paul O'Neill. 

KRAMER

He can do it, Mr. Kramer. I know he can. He'll do it for me. 

TV

'Klick! Long fly ball into deep left field over Bell's head . . . O'Neill's rounding second O'Neill going for third, O'Neill rounding . . . 

KRAMER

Come on Come on! 

TV

. . . third being waived in. 

KRAMER

GO! GO!! 

TV

. . . Martinez throws it over Alomar's head. O'Neill is safe at home. And the Yankees take the lead. 

KRAMER

An In The Park Home Run! 

BOBBY

Yeay! 

KRAMER

All Right! Yeah, well, I guess I'll be on my way (grabs framed card) 

TV

That's being scored a triple for Paul O'Neill with a throwing error charged to Martinez. 

BOBBY

Hey, ... 

KRAMER

Huh? 

BOBBY

... that's not a home run. (grabs frame) 

KRAMER

Yeah, maybe not technically, but ... 

BOBBY

You said he'd hit two home runs. 

KRAMER

Oh, come on. Bobby, Bobby! That's just as good! 

BOBBY

Well, you're not taking that card. 

KRAMER

Now, Bobby, Bobby, we had a deal . . . gimme that ... 

HOLLY

So, is the chop the way you like it? 

JERRY

I usually like mine with an angioplasty. 

ELAINE

You know something really stinks to high h... Holly! What are you doing here? 

JERRY

What everyone does here. - Cooking pork chops. 

ELAINE

I'm uh, I'm meeting James here. He's bringing over your jacket. 

HOLLY

What about the napkins? 

ELAINE

I didn't take your napkins. 

HOLLY

Then who did? 

ELAINE

Ask Jerry. 

JERRY

We could argue all night over who took the napkins. The point is in today's modern world it just doesn't seem relevant. 

WILHELM

I still want to know what happened to that birthday card? Now, Morgan, did you ever sign it? 

MORGAN

No sir, George never gave it to me. 

GEORGE

No, that's right, I didn't. I take full responsibility for the card not being here. I, uh, . . . 

KRAMER

Hi, 

WILHELM

What's this? 

KRAMER

Oh, it's a birthday card. 

KRAMER

(to George) Oh, by the way, tomorrow night, Paull O'Neill has to catch a fly ball in his hat. 

WILHELM

George, this is beautiful. Why didn't you tell me you were going to have it mounted like this? 

KRAMER

And you were probably just going to stick it in an envelope. 

WILHELM

Ha ha ha ha ha, George, keep up the good work. 

MORGAN

Ha ha, uh, well you screwed me again, Costanza. How am I supposed to sign the card now when it's already under glass? 

ELAINE

Uh, this is,... 

HOLLY

Excuse me. What are those dogs wearing? 

JAMES

Oh, bandanas, aren't they cute? 

HOLLY

You gave Memma's napkins to some dogs?! 

JERRY

Hey, what happened to my jacket? 

JAMES

Oh, the dogs did that but it wasn't their fault, somebody stuffed some strange meat in the pocket. 

HOLLY

Was it mutton? 

JAMES

Could have been. 

HOLLY

Do you always stuff meat in your pocket? 

JERRY

Uh, sometimes I use the sofa. 

GEORGE

You wanted to see me, Mr. Steinbrenner? 

STEINBRENNER

Yes, George, please, come in, come in. 

STEINBRENNER

Thanks for the card. I loved it. Gosh it made me feel good. You know, word has it that you were the brains behind the whole thing. 

GEORGE

Oh, no, not just me, the whole organization. Especially Mr. Morgan. 

STEINBRENNER

Morgan, Morgan, you know his name is conspicuously absent from this card. Almost like he went out of his way not to sign it. 

GEORGE

Oh no, Morgan is a good man sir. 

STEINBRENNER

You can stop kowtowing to Morgan. Congratulations, you got his job. 

GEORGE

Wa, uh, thank you sir, you know I am not quite sure I'm right for it. 

STEINBRENNER

Stop it George, he's out, you're in. 

STEINBRENNER

A lot more work you know. 

GEORGE

I know. 

STEINBRENNER

A lot more responsibility. Long long hours. 

GEORGE

I know. 

STEINBRENNER

Not much more money. But you'll finally get the recognition you deserve. 

GEORGE

That's what I'm afraid of. You know Mr. Steinbrenner, . . . 

STEINBRENNER

You know as painfull as it is I had to let a few people go over the years. Yogi Berra, Lou Pinella, Bucky Dent, Billy Martin, Dallas Green, Dick Houser, Bill Virdon, Billy Martin, Scott Marrow, Billy Martin, Bob Lemmon, Billy Martin, Gene Michael, Buck Showalter, ... uh, tut!, . . .George, you didn't hear that from me. (George exits) . . . George! 

JERRY

(to Elaine) I can't believe you write for this J.Peterman catalog. (to George) Get this one: 'I packed my rod and reel. 30 hours later, lost in the fiord, a welcoming smile. Thank god she spotted the epaulettes on my Norwegian ice-fishing vest'. 

GEORGE

This catalog is all about how to score in a foreign country. 

ELAINE

Yeah. What do you do all day? 

GEORGE

Not that much. 

ELAINE

uh-uh. 

JERRY

I thought that new promotion was supposed to be a lot more work. 

GEORGE

Yeah, when the season starts. Right now, I sit around pretending that I'm busy. 

JERRY

How do you pull that off? 

GEORGE

I always look annoyed. Yeah, when you look annoyed all the time, people think that you're busy. Think about it... (acts annoyed for 3 seconds). 

ELAINE

Yeah, you do! He looks very busy! 

JERRY

Yeah, he looks busy! Yeah! 

GEORGE

I know what I'm doin'. In fact Mr. Wilhelm gave me one of those little stress dolls. All right. (gets up) Back to work. (acts annoyed and leaves) 

ELAINE

(laughs) 

JERRY

So did you come up with a little stupid story for the Himalayan walking shoe yet? 

ELAINE

No. I'm completely blocked! In fact, I'm gonna work on it tonight. Oh. Oh no! Oh, I can't! I got that marathon runner coming in tonight. 

JERRY

What marathon runner? 

ELAINE

You know, this guy Jean-Paul, Jean-Paul... I met him when I was working at Pendant, editing a book on running... 

JERRY

Oh, wait! Jean-Paul, Jean-Paul! Isn't he the guy who overslept at the Olympics 4 years ago and missed the marathon?! 

ELAINE

Yeah, that's him. 

JERRY

He's from uh...Trinidad and Tobago, right? 

ELAINE

Yeah, he's Trinidadian and...Tobagan. (laughs) 

JERRY

How do you oversleep at the Olympics...? 

ELAINE

Ah, I know. I know...! 

JERRY

I mean, it's like the biggest event of your life! You'd think you'd have, like, 6 alarm clocks, payin'-off little kids in the village to come banging on your door... 

ELAINE

Yeah, well, he was pretty devastated. This is his first race in 3 years. 

JERRY

Ah...that's a big responsability on your hands. 

ELAINE

What responsibility? I don't have any responsibility. 

JERRY

You gotta wake him up! 

ELAINE

Eh...he'll get up... 

ELAINE

Hi, Judy. 

JUDY

Hi, Elaine. How are you? 

ELAINE

Fine. (laughs) 

JERRY

I've seen her in your building. 

ELAINE

Yeah. 

JERRY

I didn't know she was married. 

ELAINE

(whispering) She's not... and the guy just took off. (makes a sad face) Don't say anything to anybody. 

JERRY

Whom I gonna tell? 

ELAINE

I know, it's just something you have to say... 

WILHELM

George, we just got the final budget numbers. We went over budget on some of the items, but I don't think there's gonna be a problem. (hands over the budget file to a very annoyed George) I'll let you get back to work, George. (Mr. Wilhelm leaves the office) 

JERRY

He overslept and missed the whole race. Isn't that amazing? 

GEORGE

I'll tell you what happened. I bet he got the AM/PM mixed-up. 

JERRY

My money's on the snooze. I bet he hit the snooze for an extra 5 and it never came back on. (Kramer enters with a bucket and starts filling it with water on the sink) Imagine your whole life riding on an alarm clock. 

KRAMER

Alarm clocks? I never use 'em. Don't trust 'em. 

JERRY

What do you do? 

KRAMER

I have a uh...mental alarm. I set my head for... quarter to seven and... (makes sound with the lips - 'pop!') ...I get up! 

JERRY

Always works? 

KRAMER

It never fails. See, it's based on your body clock. See, your body has an internal mechanism. It knows what time it is. 

GEORGE

uh-uh. What's with the bucket? 

KRAMER

Lomez, he sold me his hot tub. 

JERRY

Hot tub? 

KRAMER

Yeah yeah, it's in my living room. I just gotta fill it. (points to bucket) 

GEORGE

You put a hot tub... in your living room? 

KRAMER

Oh, it's a beauty! It's got these high-volume aqua-sage jets oscillating and pulsating, soothing your every aching muscle. The water's gonna get over 120 degrees! (happy) 

GEORGE

Is that tolerable? 

KRAMER

Oh...it's tolerable...! (happy) 

JERRY

Isn't that the same temperature the coffee that scalded you? 

KRAMER

Oh, I think it's a little cooler than that... (smiles and leaves) 

GEORGE

He uh...doesn't have any running water? 

JERRY

I don't ask those kind of questions anymore. 

ELAINE

Jerry. Jerry, this is Jean-Paul. 

JERRY

Ah, hi Jean-Paul. Nice to meet you. 

PAUL

Nice to meet you. 

JERRY

Sorry about the Olympics. 

PAUL

Me too. (disappointed) 

ELAINE

Listen, listen I'm gonna go call work to see if I can get my deadline extended. I can't...come up with anything for this thing. 

JERRY

Ah...catalog writer's block? 

ELAINE

Yeah, that's funny. (annoyed) 

JERRY

(pause) So what happened? The snooze alarm, wasn't it? 

PAUL

Man, it wasn't the snooze. Most people think it was the snooze, but no, no snooze. 

JERRY

AM/PM. 

PAUL

Man, it wasn't the AM/PM. It was the volume. 

JERRY

Ah...the volume. 

PAUL

Yes, the volume. There was a separate knob for the radio alarm. 

JERRY

Ah, separate knob. 

PAUL

Yes, separate knob. Why separate knob?! Why separate knob?! (frustrated) 

JERRY

Some people like to have the radio alarm a little louder than the radio. 

PAUL

Oh, please, man, please! 

JERRY

Don't worry, it's not gonna happen again. Not if I have anything to say about it. 

JERRY

Elaine, what's the alarm clock situation in your house? 

ELAINE

Jerry... 

JERRY

It's a simple question... 

ELAINE

I've got an alarm, ok? 

JERRY

That old one? Didn't I once miss a flight to Cleveland because of that alarm clock? 

PAUL

Flight to Cleveland? 

ELAINE

It works. 

JERRY

Elaine... 

ELAINE

It... works! 

GEORGE

Eh...come oooon...(starts stabbing the paper with the pen. Mr. Wilhelm comes in) 

WILHELM

George...I think you may be taking work a little too seriously. 

GEORGE

Well...I've got a lot to do! 

WILHELM

George, I'll tell you what I'd like you to do. I, I'd like you to drop everything. 

WILHELM

I have this... fun little assignment I think you'll enjoy. There's some reps in from the Houston Astros for talks on that interleague play... and I want you to show them a good time.(George acts like 'ok, you're the boss') 

ELAINE

Hey. Sorry I'm late. 

JERRY

You're 40 minutes late. What happened? 

ELAINE

I got held up. Do you mind if I heat this muffin up? 

JERRY

No. 

ELAINE

What? (Elaine puts her muffin in the microwave and sets the timer) What is the problem? 

JERRY

Well, you said you were gonna be here at a certain time, and you weren't. 

ELAINE

uh-uh. uh-uh. And this all means uh...what? 

JERRY

Well, means that a man has come from very far away to compete in a very difficult race, he's put his faith in you, and frankly, I'm a little concerned! 

ELAINE

Oh are you?! 

JERRY

Yes I am. 

ELAINE

Hey, I'm not running in the marathon! He is! 

JERRY

Yeah, I know that! 

ELAINE

Yeah, I got enough to think about just tryin' to come up with some load o'crap for that Himalayan walking shoe! I mean, I've given him a place to stay, I'll set an alarm, but I'm not gonna turn my life completely upside down for this guy! 

JERRY

I'm not talking about upside down. (Jean-Paul and Kramer come in) I'm talking about waking him up! 

ELAINE

Hey, Jean-Paul. 

JERRY

Hey, Jean-Paul. How was your soak? Was a good soak? 

PAUL

Ah, man, very good soak. The soak o'the year! 

KRAMER

(smelling) What's burning? 

ELAINE

Oh! (rushing to the microwave) My muffin! (opens microwave door) Oh, shoot! (slams it) 

JERRY

What happened? 

ELAINE

Oh I don't know. I set this thing for 20 seconds. 

KRAMER

This was set for 2 minutes. See? 

ELAINE

(pointing at Jerry) Don't say anything! Don't..say..anything! 

PAUL

You miss-set the timer... 

ELAINE

(leaning against the refrigerator) Jean-Paul, it's not my microwave, ok? Ok? All right, listen, let's just go. Come on, Jean-Paul, let's go. Let's go. 

PAUL

Ok. 

ELAINE

(to Jerry) All right. We'll see you at the race, ok? 

JERRY

Yeah. I hope so ?! 

ELAINE

Oh that's cute! (closes door and exits with Jean-Paul) 

JERRY

Kramer, I'm tellin' you, Elaine doesn't know whatta hell she's doin'! I gotta take over this whole operation! 

KRAMER

Jerry, look how tense you are... You need to take a soak. 

JERRY

I'm not taking a soak in that human bacteria frat you got goin' there. 

KRAMER

Come on, I'm tellin' you, it's great. I opened up all the windows... the air is cold, the tub is boiling hot... It's like Sweden, man. Sweeeeden! 

KRAMER

(relaxing) ...oooohhh yeeaaah... aaahhh... (he is really enjoying this) 

CLAYTON

...'till this bastard over here says: 'let's call the sons o'bitches and go visit 'em on New York!' (the 3 men laugh) 

GEORGE

(smiling) Well, we're certainly glad that you could make it. 

GARDNER

I like your organization, George. We've been talkin' to a really friendly son of a bitch in the front office. Wilhelm, I think his name. 

GEORGE

Oh yes, Mr.Wilhelm, yeah... 

GARDNER

He told us that George Costanza was gonna be takin' us bastards out on the town. (the 3 men laugh again) I said: 'that son of a bitch doesn't know what he's got in store for him!'. (the 3 men laugh once more) 

ZEKE

Finish your drink? 

GEORGE

Oh yeah, al-almost. Almost. 

ZEKE

Let's get that bastard bring us another round! (waves to bartender) 

CLAYTON

You a big drinker, George? 

GEORGE

Well...maybe not as much as this bastard... (points at Zeke, they all laugh) I can hold my own! (they all continue laughing and drinking) 

JERRY

Jean-Paul, I asked you down here this morning because I'm concerned. Concerned that tomorrow is perhaps the biggest race of your entire career. And the person with whom you have chosen to stay... is uh... 

PAUL

What are you saying? 

JERRY

I'm saying 'get the hell outta there'! Let me put you in a hotel. You'll be comfortable, you'll be near the starting line, and most importantly... you'll have a wake-up call, Jean-Paul! A wake-up call! 

PAUL

Wake-up call... 

JERRY

These people never fail. They sit in a room with a big clock all night long, just waitin' to make that call! (George comes in) 

PAUL

No, I will stay with Elaine. It would be rude. 

GEORGE

Hey, you bastards. 

JERRY

Hey, how was the meeting? 

GEORGE

I really like those sons of bitches. 

JERRY

Sons of bitches? 

GEORGE

Yeah! That's how they talk. You know, everyone's either a bastard or a son of a bitch. Yeah, it's like uh...'boy, that son of a bitch Box can really hit, uh?!' (laughs) 

PAUL

Really?! 

GEORGE

Yeah, yeah. That's how they talk in the major league. (laughs) 

KRAMER

Heeeeey... 

JERRY

How many sweaters you got on? 

KRAMER

Oh...four. (to waitress) Yeah, could I have a cup o'tea? Boiling hot. 

GEORGE

What's goin'on? 

KRAMER

I fell asleep in the hot tub and the heat pump broke. Water went down to 58 degrees. I can't get my core temperature back up! 

JERRY

Your core temperature? 

KRAMER

(to Jean-Paul) Here, feel my hand. (takes off glove) Yeah, feel. 

PAUL

Phew... this son of a bitch is ice-cold. (smiles) 

GEORGE

Hello? 

CLAYTON

uh...is that you, George? 

GEORGE

(laughs) Yeah, it's me. Is this Clayton? 

CLAYTON

Well listen, you son of a bitch! You know where we are? 30 000 feet above your head, you bastard! (the 3 laugh and howl) 

GEORGE

What are they doin' lettin' you bastards on an airplane? Don't they know that's against FAA regulation? 

CLAYTON

(to the other 2 men) Hey, hush up, now! I can't hear him! 

GEORGE

Listen. I want you guys to send along those agreements the minute you land. Our boys can't wait to kick your butts! 

ZEKE

(to Clayton) When's that bastard comin' to Houston? 

CLAYTON

Hey, Zeke wants to know when you Yankee bastards are comin' to Houston! 

GEORGE

You tell that son of a bitch no Yankee is ever comin' to Houston. Not as long as you bastards are running things. 

CLAYTON

Hey, uh, speak up, George, I can't hear ya! 

GEORGE

(Mr.Wilhelm comes in and hears George yelling) You tell that son of a bitch no Yankee is ever comin' to Houston! Not as long as you bastards are running things! 

WILHELM

George! George, get a hold of yourself! 

GEORGE

Mr.Wilhelm... 

WILHELM

What's the matter with you?! 

GEORGE

Well I-I... 

ELAINE

(thinking and typing) It was a cold winter's night in Timbuktu... (hits the keyboard) Oh! This stinks! (grabs a Himalayan walking shoe and starts squeezing it for inspiration) Oh, come on... come on...!...God! (quits) 

PAUL

Hello. 

JUDY

Hello. 

PAUL

I'm a friend of Elaine's. 

JUDY

Oh, hi. 

PAUL

(looks at the baby) oooooh...look at the cute little bastard... (the building manager comes in) you are mama's little bastard, aren't you? (laughs) 

MANAGER

Whatta hell are you doin' harassing my tenants? 

PAUL

(smiling) Oh come on, you son of a bitch. I'm just trying to be friendly. 

MANAGER

All right, that's it! (grabs Jean-Paul and gets him out) Let's go! 

PAUL

What...but I got a race tomorrow! 

GEORGE

Whoa...it's like a furnace in here! 

JERRY

Oh whatta hell is goin'on?! 

KRAMER

Yeah, I turned up the heat. 

JERRY

Turn up the heat in your apartment! (opens a window) 

KRAMER

I'm freezin'! I just need to get my hot tub running. I'm waiting for my new heat pump. 

GEORGE

Well what's in this giant box out in the hall? 

KRAMER

Uh? Oh that must be it. 

GEORGE

It's huge! 

KRAMER

Yeah, yeah, I got the biggest one they had. It's industrial strength. 16000 BTU's. 

JERRY

Hello?...yeah, I can be there in 10 minutes...you can count on me! (hangs up) 

GEORGE

(Jerry is going to his bedroom) What? 

JERRY

I got the call...! 

GEORGE

Jean-Paul? 

JERRY

(stops walking) Jean-Paul! (George acts like he scored) 

JERRY

Pretty lucky to find this hotel, Jean-Paul. 

PAUL

Man, I just want to get some sleep. (gets into bed) 

JERRY

All right. (picks up the alarm clock) Let's check out the clock. Notch good... 6:50... volume check. (music playing, he starts swinging) What kinda music you wanna wake up to? Top 40, classical... 

PAUL

Man, whatever! (annoyed) 

JERRY

How about adult contemporary? 

PAUL

Fine, adult contemporary. Just pick one! (irritated) 

JERRY

All right...we're going with adult contempo... (puts alarm away, gets phone) now... the failsafe. The wake-up guy... (dials) 

PAUL

Yes, yes, the wake-up guy. 

MAN

(on the phone) Front desk...? 

JERRY

Yeah, this is room 419, I'd like a wake-up call for 6:50 AM tomorrow morning. 

MAN

Yes sir. 

JERRY

That's room 419. 6:50 AM. Four...one...niner... 

MAN

Yes, I got it sir. You only had to say it once. 

JERRY

I know, but it's a very important wake-up call... and I don't wanna take any chances. 

MAN

Every wake-up call I make is important. You're no more important than any of our guests. 

JERRY

Well, I just...don't wanna get into a whole thing with you here... 

MAN

Are you through? (annoyed) 

JERRY

...Yeah I am, but I just...(man hangs-up) 

JERRY

humm... 

PAUL

What is it...? 

JERRY

I think I offended the wake-up guy...! (worried) 

PAUL

No, no. 

JERRY

(gets up) No, no, I did. I think he's got it in for me! 

PAUL

Man, he doesn't got 'in' for you. 

JERRY

What if he doesn't call now out of spite? 

PAUL

It is his job! 

JERRY

(pause) Not comfortable... (gets up again) 

PAUL

For God's sake...! (gets up and they start packing) 

ELAINE

Jean-Paul? (searching everywhere) Hey Jean-Paul? Jean-Paul? (worried) Jean-Paul?! Oh man... (calling Jerry's) Oh...machine. 

MACHINE

I'm not here, leave a message. 

ELAINE

Jerry, Jerry, Jean-Paul's missing! He's alone in the city! Call me back. (hangs up) 

ELAINE

Judy, hi, listen... 

JUDY

You have got some nerve, Elaine! I told you about that baby in confidence! 

ELAINE

Oh I didn't tell anyone. 

JUDY

Well your friend certainly seemed to know all about it. (shuts the door) 

ELAINE

... Jerry! (runs angry to her apartment) 

JERRY

Feel much better here at my home base, Jean-Paul. It's a controlled environment. 

PAUL

It's a marathon, you know. 26 miles! I need to get some sleep! (lies on the sofa) 

JERRY

Hey, believe me, if I'd been with you there in Barcelona...you'd be polishing that medal right now. (covers Jean-Paul with a blanket) 

PAUL

Left a comfortable hotel bedroom for this! 

JERRY

That wake-up guy was trouble! All right, I'll be right back. (goes knocking on Kramer's) 

JERRY

(shouting) Man that thing is noisy! 

KRAMER

(shouting) Yeah yeah, we're cracking along pretty good! We're almost up to 80 degrees! 

JERRY

Yeah, listen, do me a favor. Set your mental alarm for 6:30 and gimme a call. 

KRAMER

Yeah, ok. Wait. (concentrates and makes the 'pop!' sound) Done! (Jerry stares, confused) 

JERRY

He's put his faith in you. He's put his faith in you. 

PAUL

I trust Elaine, she is my friend. I trust Elaine, she is my friend. 

JERRY

Frankly, I'm a little concerned. 

ELAINE

Ohhh, I'm exhausted. I've been on this street a thousand times! It's never looked so strange! The faces...so cold! In the distance, a child is crying. Fatherless...a bastard child, perhaps. My back aches...my heart aches...but my feet (stops to look at her feet) ...my feet are resilient! (a big smile grows in her face, as she thinks...) Thank God I took off my heels, and put on my... HIMALAYAN WALKING SHOES!!! (lifting her arms up in the air, in ecstasy, as she says...) Yes! 

JERRY

4:02? (Checks his wristwatch) Aaa-aaahhh! Eight forty seven Jean-Paul! Wake up! Wake uuuuup! 

PAUL

8:47!? (jumps out of the sofa) 

JERRY

Come on, just put your clothes on! You'll get dressed in the car! 

PAUL

Idiot! I trusted you! 

JERRY

Kramer, what happened to the building?! The electricity went out! 

KRAMER

Yeah, the heat pump blew all the fuses! 

JERRY

What happened to your mental alarm?! 

KRAMER

I guess I hit the snooze... (Jerry runs by Kramer and Kramer falls down) 

JERRY

Make way! I've got-I've got a runner here! Get outta the way! Make way! Make way! Make way, it's a contender! (an event guard stops them) 

GUAD

Hey, hold it! 

PAUL

I'm late, man, I'm in the race! 

GUARD

Go ahead. 

PAUL

Thank you Jerry, you're a wonderful driver. Fantastic route, man! 

JERRY

All right, go, it's a race! Come on! 

GEORGE

You wanted to see me, Mr.Steinbrenner? 

STEINBRENNER

Yes, George, come in, come in. George, word up's you've been cracking under the pressure. Can't cope, can't stand the heat. Spit the bit. 

GEORGE

Oh no, Mr.Steinbrenner, I can explain... 

STEINBRENNER

Oh we all get a little cuckoo sometimes George, I used to be like you. Rating personnel 'till they cried, calling managers on the field during a game, threatening to move the team to New Jersey, just to upset people. Then I found a way to relax. I've got two words to say to you, George hot tub. (George looks at him, puzzled) 

JERRY

I'm tellin'you, I never told anyone about that baby. I never even went near your building! 

ELAINE

Then how did she find out, Jerry?! 

JERRY

Maybe you should check with the rabbi. 

KRAMER

(to Elaine) You want some hot tea? 

ELAINE

Oh no, thank you. 

KRAMER

Oh. There's some runners. Here they come! 

ELAINE

There's Jean-Paul! He's up front! He's leading! (jumping) Go Jean-Paul!(starts screaming) 

KRAMER

Oh yeah! Yeah! Come on! (starts howling) 

JERRY

Come on, let's go Jean-Paul! 

ELAINE

Go Jean-Paaaaaul! 

STEINBRENNER

How're you enjoying it, George? Melts that tension away, doesn't it? You gotta get that jet on the good spot. Oh. Oh. Uh. Uh. Yes, that feels good. Yes, that's real good. Oh yeah, that's where I keep all my tension. Right down to that chicken bone. Sometimes I get my wife to just stuck her thumb right in there like a screwdriver. Ya know, the Phillips head, not the flat one. Oh God, those flat ones frustrate me. You got it in, but it slips out. You put it in again, slips out again. You a single man, George? 

GEORGE

(bored to death) Well, I-I just recently uh... 

STEINBRENNER

I'll tell you, if you wanna get something wild goin'on in your life, you get a girl and bring her to one o'these things. Just like 4 shots a wild turkey. (laughs) She'll think you're Hopalong Cassidy. (George starts sliding, until he gets all his head -and glasses- under water, as Steinbrenner keeps talking) A show, about that Mickey Mantle, wasn't it? You know we used to talk. I don't think he liked me very much, you know. 

GEORGE

All right. So, what theatre you wanna go to tonight? We got 61st and 3rd or 84th and Broadway. 

JERRY

Which one you wanna go to shmoopy? 

SHEILA

You called me shmoppy. You're a shmoopy. 

JERRY

You're a shmoopy! 

SHEILA

You're a shmoopy! 

JERRY

You're a shmoopy! 

GEORGE

All right, shmoopies...what's it gonna be? Pick a theater. 

JERRY

Uh,..we'll go to 3rd Avenue. So, can you come with us for lunch to the soup place? 

SHEILA

No. You have a good lunch. But I'll meet you back here for the movie. 

GEORGE

Hey. 

ELAINE

Hey. 

SHEILA

Hi Elaine. 

ELAINE

Hi Sheila. 

JERRY

All right, then. I'll see you later. 

SHEILA

Bye shmoopy. 

JERRY

Bye shmoopy. 

ELAINE

Okay. We ready to go? 

GEORGE

Yes. Please. Please, let's go. 

ELAINE

Boy, I'm in the mood for a cheeseburger. 

JERRY

No. We gotta go to the soup place. 

ELAINE

What soup place? 

GEORGE

Oh, there's a soup stand, Kramer's been going there. 

JERRY

He's always raving. I finally got a chance to go there the other day, and I tell you this, you will be stunned. 

ELAINE

Stunned by soup? 

JERRY

You can't eat this soup standing up, your knees buckle. 

ELAINE

Huh. All right. Come on. 

JERRY

There's only one caveat -- the guy who runs the place is a little temperamental, especially about the ordering procedure. He's secretly referred to as the Soup Nazi. 

ELAINE

Why? What happens if you don't order right? 

JERRY

He yells and you don't get your soup. 

ELAINE

What? 

JERRY

Just follow the ordering procedure and you will be fine. 

GEORGE

All right. All right. Let's - let's go over that again. 

JERRY

All right. As you walk in the place move immediately to your right. 

ELAINE

What? 

JERRY

The main thing is to keep the line moving. 

GEORGE

All right. So, you hold out your money, speak your soup in a loud, clear voice, step to the left and receive. 

JERRY

Right. It's very important not to embellish on your order. No extraneous comments. No questions. No compliments. 

ELAINE

Oh, boy, I'm really scared! 

JERRY

Elaine. 

ELAINE

All right. Jerry, that's enough now about the Soup Nazi. Whoa! Wow! Look at this. You know what this is? This is an antique armoire. Wow! It's French. Armoire. 

JERRY

Ar-moire. 

ELAINE

How much is this? 

GUY

I was asking 250, but you got a nice face. 2 even. 

ELAINE

Huh? Ha. 200. You know, I've always wanted one of these things. 

JERRY

He gave you the nice face discount. 

ELAINE

Yeah. All right. You guys go ahead. 

JERRY

What about the soup? 

ELAINE

I'm getting an armoire, Jerry. 

JERRY

[in French accent] Pardon. 

GEORGE

This line is huge. 

JERRY

It's like this all the time. 

GEORGE

Isn't that that Bania guy? 

JERRY

Oh, no. It is. Just be still. 

GEORGE

Whoop! Too late. I think he picked up the scent. 

BANIA

Hey, Jerry! I didn't know you liked soup. 

JERRY

Hard to believe. 

BANIA

This guy makes the best soup in the city, Jerry. The best. You know what they call him? Soup Nazi. 

JERRY

Shhhhh! All right, Bania, I - I'm not letting you cut in line. 

BANIA

Why not? 

JERRY

Because if he catches us, we'll never be able to get soup again. 

BANIA

Okay. Okay. 

GEORGE

Medium turkey chili. 

JERRY

Medium crab bisque. 

GEORGE

I didn't get any bread. 

JERRY

Just forget it. Let it go. 

GEORGE

Um, excuse me, I - I think you forgot my bread. 

NAZI

Bread -- $2 extra. 

GEORGE

$2? But everyone in front of me got free bread. 

NAZI

You want bread? 

GEORGE

Yes, please. 

NAZI

$3! 

GEORGE

What? 

NAZI

No soup for you! [snaps fingers] 

ELAINE

What do you mean I can't bring in here? I live here. 

SUPER

Its Sunday, Elaine. There's no moving on Sunday. That's the rule. 

ELAINE

But I didn't know, Tom. I g -- can't you just make an exception? Please. I've got a nice face. 

SUPER

Tomorrow, okay? You can move it in tommorrow. I'll even give you a hand, all right? 

ELAINE

Ohh! Well, you're just gonna have to hold this for me. 

GUY

I'm a guy on the sidewalk. I don't have layaway. 

ELAINE

Oh, no...please don't go. Please - please don't walk away. 

JERRY

Oh, man. Ohh! This is fantastic. How does he do it? 

GEORGE

You know, I don't see how you can sit there eating that and not even offer me any? 

JERRY

I gave you a taste. What do you want? 

GEORGE

Why can't we share? 

JERRY

I told you not to say anything. You can't go in there, brazenly flaunt the rules and then think I'm gonna share with you! 

GEORGE

Do you hear yourself? 

JERRY

I'm sorry. This is what comes from living under a Nazi regime. 

GEORGE

Well, I gotta go back there and try again. Hi Sheila. 

SHEILA

Hi. Hi shmoopy. 

JERRY

Hi shmoopy. 

SHEILA

No, you're a shmoopy! 

JERRY

You're a shmoopy! 

GEORGE

I'm going. 

JERRY

Hey, listen, so we'll meet you and Susan at the movie tonight? 

GEORGE

You know what? I changed my mind. I, uh, I don't think so. 

JERRY

Why? 

GEORGE

I just don't feel like it anymore. 

JERRY

Just like that? 

GEORGE

Just like that. 

SHEILA

Boy, he's a weird guy, isn't he? 

KRAMER

Hey. 

JERRY

Hey. 

KRAMER

[taking Jerry's couch cushion] Yeah. 

JERRY

Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Wha -- what are you doing? 

KRAMER

Yeah. Elaine, she has to leave her armoire on the street all night...I'm gonna guard it for her. I need something to sit on. 

JERRY

Well, sit on one of your couch cushions. 

KRAMER

Yeah, but this is so nice and thick. Ahoy there! 

ELAINE

Oh, Kramer! Thank God. I really appreciate you doing this. 

KRAMER

Yeah. Well, you ask for it, you got it. 

ELAINE

Do you need anything? 

KRAMER

Well, a bowl of muligatawny would hit the spot. 

ELAINE

Mulligatawny? 

KRAMER

Yeah. It's an Indian soup. It's simmered to perfection by one of the great soup artisans in the modern era. 

ELAINE

Oh! Who? The Soup Nazi? 

KRAMER

He's not a Nazi. He just happens to be a little eccentric. Most geniuses are. 

ELAINE

All right. I'll be back. 

KRAMER

Wait a second. You don't even know how to order. 

ELAINE

Oh, no. No. No. No. I got it. 

KRAMER

No. No, Elaine! 

ELAINE

Hey, I got it. Hey. Didn't you already get soup? 

GEORGE

No. I didn't get it. 

ELAINE

Why? What happened? 

GEORGE

I made a mistake. 

ELAINE

[laughing] 

GEORGE

All right. Well, we'll see what happens to you. 

ELAINE

Yeah. No. Listen, George, I am quite certain I'm walking out of there with a bowl of soup. 

GEORGE

Yeah. Hey, let ask you something. Is it just me, or - or do you find it unbearable to be around Jerry and that girl? 

ELAINE

Oh, I know! It is awful! 

GEORGE

Why do they have to do that in front of people? 

ELAINE

I don't know. 

GEORGE

What is that with the shmoopy? 

ELAINE

Ohh! 

GEORGE

The shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy, shmmopy, shmoopy! 

ELAINE

Ohh! Stop it! I know. 

GEORGE

I had to listen to a five minute discussion on which one is actually called shmoopy. 

ELAINE

Ugh! 

GEORGE

And I cancelled plans to go to the movies with them tonight. 

ELAINE

You know, we should say something. 

GEORGE

You know, we absolutely should. 

ELAINE

I mean, why does he do that? Doesn't he know what a huge turnoff that is? 

GEORGE

I don't know. He can be so weird sometimes. 

ELAINE

Yeah. 

GEORGE

I still haven't figured him out. 

ELAINE

No. Me neither. 

GEORGE

All right. Shh! I gotta focus. I'm shifting into soup mode. 

ELAINE

Oh, God! 

GEORGE

Good afternoon. One large crab bisque to go. Bread. Beautiful. 

NAZI

You're pushing your luck little man. 

GEORGE

Sorry. Thank you. 

ELAINE

Hi there. Um, uh -- [drumming on countertop] Oh! Oh! Oh! One mulligatawny and, um.... what is that right there? Is that lima bean? 

NAZI

Yes. 

ELAINE

Never been a big fan. [coughing] Um..you know what? Has anyone ever told you you look exactly like Al Pacino? You know, ' Scent Of A Woman.' Who-ah! Who-ah! 

NAZI

Very good. Very good. 

ELAINE

Well, I -- 

NAZI

You know something? 

ELAINE

Hmmm? 

NAZI

No soup for you! 

ELAINE

What? 

NAZI

Come back one year! Next! 

RAY

Look at this. 

BOB

It's an antique. 

RAY

It's all hand made and I love the in-lay. 

BOB

Yes. Yes. me, too. Ay, it's gorgeous. Completely. Pick it up. No. No. Pick it up from the bottom over there. 

KRAMER

Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. What are you doing? 

BOB

What does it look like we're doing? We're taking this. 

KRAMER

You can't take this. This belongs to a friend of mine. 

BOB

Look, you wanna get hurt? 

KRAMER

Huh? 

BOB

I don't think you wanna get hurt. Because if you wanna get hurt I can hurt you. Now, just back off. 

RAY

Bob. 

BOB

Just pick it up. 

KRAMER

What is this, huh? 

BOB

You have some kind of problem here? What is it you not understanding? We taking the armoire and that's all there is to it. Okay? 

ELAINE

I mean, is he allowed to do this? It's discrimination! I'm gonna call the states' attorney office. I really am. 

GEORGE

Oh, this is fabulous. My God Elaine, you have to taste this. 

ELAINE

All right. All right. Give me a tsate. Mmm! Oh God, I gotta sit down. What happened? Where's my armoire? 

KRAMER

Well, b -- it was stolen. 

ELAINE

Wha--? 

KRAMER

These street toughs, they robbed me. 

ELAINE

Street toughs took my armoire? 

KRAMER

Yeah. It was very frightening. My life was in danger. You should've seen the way they talked to me. 

ELAINE

I can't believe this! 

KRAMER

Well, where's the soup? 

ELAINE

Wha -- the Soup Nazi threw me out. 

KRAMER

Oh...yeah! 

JERRY

What are you gonna get? 

SHEILA

I'll decide at the last minute. 

JERRY

You better decide, sister. You're on deck. Sheila! 

JERRY

Uh-oh. 

NAZI

Hey, what is this? You're kissing in my line? Nobody kisses in my line! 

SHEILA

I can kiss anywhere I want to. 

NAZI

You just cost yourself a soup! 

SHEILA

How dare you? Come on, Jerry, we're leaving. Jerry? 

JERRY

Do I know you? 

ELAINE

So, essentially, you chose soup over a woman? 

JERRY

It was a bisque. 

ELAINE

Yeah. You know what I just realized? Suddenly, George has become much more normal than you. 

JERRY

Really? 

ELAINE

Yeah. Come on. I mean, think about it. He's engaged to be married. Your top priority is soup. 

JERRY

Have you tastes the soup? 

ELAINE

Yeah. All right. You made the right decision. 

JERRY

See, the way I figure it, it's much easier to patch things up with Sheila than with the Soup Nazi. 

JERRY

Hey. 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

ELAINE

Hey. 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

JERRY

Oh, thanks. 

ELAINE

There he is. 

KRAMER

Elaine, I'm really sorry about the armoire. 

ELAINE

Yeah. I know. Me, too. 

JERRY

So, did these thieves want any money? 

KRAMER

No. 

JERRY

They just wanted the armoire? 

KRAMER

Yeah. They were..quite taken with it. 

JERRY

Yeah? 

GEORGE

Hup! Hup! 

JERRY

Hey, have you noticed George is acting a little strange lately? 

ELAINE

No. In what way? 

JERRY

I don't know. A lot of attitude, like he's better than me, or something. 

ELAINE

I don't think George has ever thought he's better than anybody. 

GEORGE

Hello. 

JERRY

Hello. 

KRAMER

Hey. 

GEORGE

Hello. 

ELAINE

Hello. 

GEORGE

Were you just talking about me? What's going on? 

JERRY

Absolutely not. 

GEORGE

Something's going on here. 

KRAMER

All right, [claps hands] I'm gonna go get some soup. 

ELAINE

One of these days that guy is gonna get his. 

GEORGE

So, how was the movie? 

JERRY

Aw, we didn't go. Sheila and I are kind of on the outs. 

GEORGE

Oh, yeah? 

JERRY

Yeah. Wha - wha - what are you, happy? 

GEORGE

Happy? Why should I be happy? 

JERRY

I don't know, but you look like you're happy. 

GEORGE

Why should I care? 

JERRY

You can't fool me. Don't insult me, George because I know when you're happy. 

GEORGE

All right. I am happy, and I'll tell ya why -- because the two of you were making me and every one of your friends sick! Right, Elaine? 

JERRY

Is that so? 

GEORGE

Yeah. Yeah. With all that kissing and the shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy out in public like that. It's disgusting! 

JERRY

Disgusting? 

GEORGE

People who do that should be arrested. 

JERRY

Well, I guess I have all the more reason to get back with her. 

GEORGE

Ye - yeah. And we had a pact, you know. 

JERRY

What? 

GEORGE

You shook my hand in that coffee shop. 

JERRY

You're still with the pact? 

GEORGE

Mmm-hmm. You reneged. 

JERRY

All I did was shake your hand. 

GEORGE

Ah-ha! 

KRAMER

And then they just ran off with the armoire, just like that. 

NAZI

Ohh! This city. 

NEWMAN

One large jambalaya, please. 

NAZI

So, continue. 

KRAMER

Well, my friend is awful disappointed is all. You know, she's very emotional. 

NEWMAN

Thank you. [inhaling deeply] Jambalaya! 

NAZI

All right, now listen to me. You have been a good friend. I have an armoire in my basement. If you want to pick it up, you're welcome to it. So, take it, it's yours. 

KRAMER

How can I possibly thank you? 

NAZI

You are the only one who understands me. 

KRAMER

You suffer for your soup. 

NAZI

Yes. That is right. 

KRAMER

You demand perfection from yourself, from your soup. 

NAZI

How can I tolerate any less from my customer? 

CUSTOMER

Uh, gazpacho, por favor. 

NAZI

Por favor? 

CUSTOMER

Um, I'm part Spanish. 

NAZI

Adios muchacho! 

KRAMER

Git. 

JERRY

It was stupid of me. 

SHEILA

Well, it was very insulting. 

JERRY

No. I know. I - I was really sort of half-kidding. 

SHEILA

Well, behind every joke there's some truth. 

JERRY

What about that Bavarian cream pie joke I told you? There's no truth to that. Nobody with a terminal illness goes from the United States to Europe for a piece of Bavarian cream pie and then when they get there and they don't have it he says ' Aw, I'll just have some coffee.' There's no truth to that. 

SHEILA

Well, I guess you're right. 

JERRY

So, am I forgiven, shmoopy? 

SHEILA

Yes, shmoopy. 

JERRY

Aw! 

SUSAN

Hey, Jerry! 

JERRY

Oh, hi Susan, George. You remember Sheila. 

GEORGE

Oh, yes. Hello. 

SHEILA

Hello. Won't you join us? 

GEORGE

No, thanks. 

SUSAN

Of course. 

GEORGE

Yes. Well -- So, uh, sit on the same side at a booth, huh? 

JERRY

Yeah. That's right. You got a problem? 

GEORGE

I, uh, just think it's a little unusual. Two people to sit on one side...and leave the other side empty. 

JERRY

Well, we're changing the rules. 

GEORGE

Ahh. Good for you. 

SUSAN

Aw, what are you getting George? 

GEORGE

I don't know, honey. What do you want to get? [in babying voice] I want you to get anything you want...'cause I love you so much. I want you to be happy. Okay, sweetie? 

SUSAN

Oh, George, you're so sweet. 

GEORGE

Well, I could be a little sweetie tweetie weetie weetie. 

SUSAN

Aww! 

JERRY

What about you, shmoopy? How 'bout a little tuna? You want a little tuna fishy? 

SHEILA

Yeah. 

JERRY

Yum yum little tuna fishy? 

GEORGE

Come here. 

KRAMER

And..voila! 

ELAINE

[gasps] 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

ELAINE

Oh! Oh, I love it! I absolutely love it! 

KRAMER

Yeah. Did the K Man do it or did the K Man do it? 

ELAINE

The K Man did it! 

KRAMER

Yeah! 

ELAINE

[laughing] How much did you pay for this thing? 

KRAMER

How 'bout zero? 

ELAINE

What? 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

ELAINE

What? Who's was it? Where'd you get it? 

KRAMER

I'll tell ya where I got it. I got it from the guy you so callously refer to as the Soup Nazi. 

ELAINE

Get out! 

ELAINE

The Soup Nazi gave it to you? 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

ELAINE

Why? 

KRAMER

Well, I told him the whole story and he just let me have it. Wha -- Yeah. He's a wonderful man. 

ELAINE

[gasps] 

KRAMER

Yeah. Well, a little bit misunderstood but, uh.... 

ELAINE

Well, I'm just gonna go down there and personally thank him. I mean, I had this guy all wrong. This is wonderful! 

KRAMER

Yeah. Well, he's a dear. 

GEORGE

How much tip do you leave on $8.15? 

SUSAN

You know sweetie, I just want you to know that I was so proud of you today expressing your feelings so freely in front of Jerry and all. Just knowing that you're not afraid of those things is such a great step forward in our relationship. 

GEORGE

Huh? 

SUSAN

[in babying voice] Because you love your little kiki don't you? 

CUSTOMER

How is he today? 

BANIA

I think he's in a good mood. 

ELAINE

Hi. You know, Kramer gave me the armoire and it is so beautiful. I'm mean, I just can't tell you how much I appreciate it. 

NAZI

You? If I knew it was for you, I never would have given it to him in the first place! I would have taken a hatchet and smashed it to pieces! Now, who wants soup? Next! Speak up! 

JERRY

I'm heading over to Elaine's. 

KRAMER

Oh. Jerry, those are the guys that mugged me for the armoire. 

JERRY

Those two? 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

JERRY

Are you sure? 

KRAMER

Yeah. That's them. 

JERRY

Well, let's confront 'em. 

KRAMER

No. No. No. No. Let's get a cop. 

JERRY

There's no cops around. They're gonna leave. Come on. 

KRAMER

No! 

JERRY

Let's go. 

BOB

Oh, wow look, that one is gorgeous. I would just kill for that one. 

RAY

Oh, not in blue. Blue does not go with all. 

BOB

Oh, please. Do you know what you're talking about? Because I don't think you know what you're talking about. Take a look at that. 

KRAMER

Excuse me. 

RAY

Are you talking to me? 

KRAMER

Uh, well, uh, we -- 

RAY

I said, are you talking to me? 

BOB

Well, maybe, he was talking to me. Was you talking to him? Because you was obviously talking to one of us. So what is it? Who?! Who was you talking to?! 

KRAMER

Well, wha -- I, uh -- uh, we were kind of, uh, talking to each other, weren't we? 

ELAINE

I mean, you know, I've never been so insulted in my entire life. There's something really wrong with this man. He is a Soup Nazi. What? What is that? 

JERRY

I don't know. ' 5 cups chopped Porcine mushrooms, half a cup of olive oil, 3 pounds of celery, chopped parsley...' 

ELAINE

Let me see this. [gasps] You know what this is? This is a recipe for soup, and look at this. There are like thirty different recipes. These are his recipes! 

JERY

So? 

ELAINE

So? So, his secret's out. Don't you see? I could give these to every restaurant in town. I could have 'em published! I could - I could drop fliers from a plane above the city. 

JERRY

Wait a second, Elaine. Where do you think you're going? 

ELAINE

What do you care? 

JERRY

Elaine, I don't want you causing any trouble down at that soup stand. I happen to love that soup. 

ELAINE

Get out of my way, Jerry. 

JERRY

Elaine, let the man make his soup! 

ELAINE

Don't make me hurt you, Jerry. 

SUSAN

Look, they have it in blue...for my baby bluey. Are you my baby bluey? 

GEORGE

Oh, yes. I - I'm your baby bluey. 

JERRY

Well. Well. 

SUSAN

Hi, Jerry. 

JERRY

Hey, Susan, George. 

SUSAN

You know, I really like Sheila a lot. 

JERRY

Oh, really? 

SUSAN

Mmm-hmm. 

JERRY

Because we're kind of not seeing each other anymore. 

SUSAN

Oh, no! That's too bad. 

JERRY

Yeah. Well, she was very affectionate - which I love. You know I love that - but mentally, we couldn't quite make the connection. 

GEORGE

Really? 

JERRY

Yeah. Too bad, 'cause you gotta have the affection - which you obviously have. I think it's great that you're so open with your affections in public. See, we had that. 

SUSAN

Mmm-hmm. 

GEORGE

You did? 

JERRY

Oh, yeah. But the mental thing. But anyway. I'll see ya. 

GEORGE

Yeah. See ya. 

NAZI

Go on! Leave! Get out! 

WOMAN

But I didn't do anything. 

NAZI

Next! 

ELAINE

Hello. 

NAZI

You. You think you can get soup? Please. You're wasting everyone's time. 

ELAINE

I don't want soup. I can make my own soup. ' 5 cups chopped Porcine mushrooms, half a cup of olive oil, 3 pounds celery.' 

NAZI

That is my recipe for wild mushroom. 

ELAINE

Yeah, that's right. I got 'em all. Cold cucumber, corn and crab chowder, mulligatawny. 

NAZI

Mulliga...tawny? 

ELAINE

You're through Soup Nazi. Pack it up. No more soup for you. Next! 

NEWMAN

[panting] Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! 

JERRY

What is it? 

NEWMAN

Something's happened with the Soup Nazi! 

JERRY

Wha - wha - what's the matter? 

NEWMAN

Elaine's down there causing all kinds of commotion. Somehow she got a hold of his recipes and she says she's gonna drive him out of business! The Soup Nazi said that now that his recipes are out, he's not gonna make anymore soup! He's moving out of the country, moving to Argentina! No more soup, Jerry! No more for of us! 

JERRY

Well, where are you going? 

NEWMAN

He's giving away what's left! I gotta go home and get a big pot! 

SUSAN

Hey, I gotta get some cash, I'm gonna run down to the ATM. 

GEORGE

Yeah, I better grab some too. 

SUSAN

I'll get it for you; just give me your card. 

GEORGE

You sure? 

SUSAN

Yeah, just tell me your code. 

GEORGE

My code? 

JERRY

So why didn't you tell her the code? 

GEORGE

No. No way. 

JERRY

George, you're gonna marry this woman. Most likely. 

GEORGE

It says very clearly, 'for your protection, do not give your secret code to anyone.' 

JERRY

So you're taking relationship advice from Chemical Bank now? 

GEORGE

Why does everything have to be 'us'? Is there no 'me' left? Why can't there be some things just for me? Is that so selfish? 

JERRY

Actually, that's the definition of selfish. 

GEORGE

Have you ever given your code to anyone? 

JERRY

No one's ever asked. You want it? It's 'Jor-El.' 

GEORGE

Superman's father on Krypton. 

JERRY

Of course. C'mon Georgie, you wanna tell me. It's eating you up inside. Sing it, sister. 

GEORGE

No. I am not giving my code to anyone for any reason. 

JERRY

What if my life depended on it? 

GEORGE

If you're in some situation where some fast cash will save your life, I'll give you the code. 

GEORGE

What's the matter with your leg? 

JERRY

My foot fell asleep. 

GEORGE

How'd your foot fall asleep? 

JERRY

I crossed my legs, I forgot to alternate. 

FRED

Hey Jerry. 

JERRY

Hey Fred. 

GEORGE

Hey Fred. 

JERRY

My foot fell asleep. 

FRED

You're lucky, at least you got something to do. 

JERRY

Fred, do you know Elaine? 

FRED

No, it's nice to meet you. Well, I'm outta here, see you guys. 

GEORGE

Alright, bye. 

JERRY

Seeya. 

ELAINE

Did you hear that? He said, 'nice to meet you.' 

JERRY

So? 

ELAINE

So? We've met before. At Katie Ash's party, we talked for like ten minutes. 

JERRY

And he didn't remember you? 

JERRY

Where are you going, you just got here? 

ELAINE

I gotta go talk to him. 

ELAINE

Excuse me, excuse me, Fred? 

FRED

Yeah? 

ELAINE

You just said, 'nice to meet you', but actually we've met before. 

FRED

We have? 

ELAINE

Yeah, at Katie Ash's party? 

FRED

What was your name again? 

ELAINE

Elaine. You don't remember our conversation? I talked about how my uncle worked in the book depository building with Lee Harvey Oswald? 

FRED

Not ringing a bell. 

ELAINE

When my uncle said to him, 'the president's been shot' Oswald winked at him and said, 'I'm gonna go catch a movie'? 

FRED

Mmm, no. 

ELAINE

That was right when we were in front of the bathroom door. 

FRED

The bathroom door. I remember someone had played tic-tac-toe on it, and the X's won; they went diagonally from the top left to the bottom right. 

JERRY

Hey that sounds great, I'd love to do some TV commercials, that should really be fun. 

JERRY

Uh huh, okay, alright, bye. Huh, how do you like that? I'm gonna do some TV spots for Leapin' Larry's Appliance Store. That was Leapin' Larry himself, I'm gonna meet with him tomorrow. 

KRAMER

Leapin' Larry! Yeah, that's where I bought this. 

JERRY

What is that? 

KRAMER

Well, it's an emergency band scanner, it picks up everything: Fires, harbor patrol, even the police. I'm watching the watchers, Jerry. Uh oh, we got a big fire on 115th. I tell ya if could do it over again, I'd give it all up to be a fireman. 

JERRY

Yeah, those civil servants who risk their lives really got it made. 

KRAMER

When I was a kid, all I ever dreamed of was steering the back of that big hook and ladder. 

JERRY

You're lucky they let you drive a car. 

KRAMER

No no no, they're talking the West Side Highway, at this time of day that's insane. They're heading straight into gridlock. Oh, those fools. 

ELAINE

What was that? 

JERRY

(waving his arm in dismissal) Eh. 

ELAINE

Alright. So, get a load of this. This guy, Fred Yerkes, remembers every little thing about that night except me. 

JERRY

Really? I'm surprised, he doesn't meet that many women. 

ELAINE

What are you saying? 

JERRY

Well, what's to be said? He didn't remember you. 

ELAINE

Yeah, but why? I mean, ya know. 

JERRY

I know. 

ELAINE

Ya know? 

JERRY

Yeah, I know. 

ELAINE

Huh, lookit, you got the new catalog. 

JERRY

Yeah, you wrote a good piece on the Himalayan Walking Shoe. 

ELAINE

Too good. Peterman was so pleased, now he wants to take me out to dinner tomorrow. Maybe you wanna come with me. 

JERRY

Why would I wanna do that? 

ELAINE

Oh please, Jerry, please please please, I can't sit with him, he tells these stories, it's gonna be awful. 

JERRY

Yeah, sounds like fun. 

SUSAN

I want you to tell me, George. 

GEORGE

Why? Why is my code so important? 

SUSAN

Because, it's part of our relationship, it's an indication of trust. We're not supposed to keep secrets from one another. 

GEORGE

Well I'm sure you have secrets from me. I don't know anything about your cycles. 

SUSAN

My cycles? 

GEORGE

Yeah, I never know what's going on there. 

SUSAN

Well from now on I'll keep you apprised of my cycles. 

GEORGE

Please. 

SUSAN

Anything else? 

GEORGE

We're out of Bosco! 

JERRY

Howbout this, come one down to Leapin' Parry's if you can beat our prices, we'll give you the store. 

LARRY

Ya know I've always liked your comedy, you don't take cheap shots. 

JERRY

No I don't. 

LARRY

Sorry for keeping you here so long. Again, I apologize for the mess. This renovation is killing me. 

JERRY

(to himself) My foot's asleep again! 

LARRY

When I lost my leg in the boating accident, I got so depressed about this damn prosthetic I thought I was gonna have to give up the business. But now I'm rejuvenated. Let me show you around the store. 

JERRY

You know what? I'll be with you in a minute. 

EMPLOYEE

That is a great impression! 

JERRY

Larry, wait, you don't understand! 

KRAMER

I just came from Leapin' Larry's. Making fun of crippled people, is that what you've sunk to? 

JERRY

I didn't do it on purpose, my foot fell asleep. 

KRAMER

Oh, oh your foot fell asleep. 

JERRY

Ya know, the guy has one leg and he still calls himself Leapin' Larry, you'd think he had a sense of humor about it. 

KRAMER

Well, you just joked yourself right out of that commercial, didn't you, munjamba? 

JERRY

Yup. 

VOICE

Hup. 

KRAMER

Boy, look at that. Se that's that fire I was listening to yesterday. 

JERRY

Wow, the whole building burned down. 

KRAMER

They just don't know what street to take. You remember that time I got us to Yankee Stadium in rush hour in fifteen minutes? 

JERRY

Of course. 

KRAMER

It's all up here, Jerry. All up here. It's innate. 

JERRY

The amazing thing is you never have any place to go. 

GEORGE

Where we gonna eat? 

JERRY

We're gonna meet Elaine and Peterman at the Chinese place. 

GEORGE

Peterman? Nobody mentioned anything about Peterman. 

JERRY

Of course not, if I did would you have gone? 

GEORGE

No way. 

JERRY

There you go. 

GEORGE

I don't even know Peterman. How the hell am I gonna relax? I'm gonna have to be on all night. I don't like being on, Jerry, I would much rather be off. 

JERRY

Trust me, you're off. 

ELAINE

Oh, hi Fred. 

FRED

Um, hello? 

ELAINE

It's Elaine. 

FRED

Oh yeah, yeah, right. 

ELAINE

How ya doin'? 

FRED

I'm depressed. I got this new shirt, the button fell off. Once the button falls off, that's it. I'll never fix it. 

ELAINE

Yeah, that's too bad. 

FRED

Yeah, I'm gonna get some vitamins, I feel depleted. 

ELAINE

Hmm. I never take them. 

FRED

Cause they make you nauseous, right? 

ELAINE

Yeah! Yeah, that's right, you remembered! 

FRED

Do you wanna have dinner tonight? 

ELAINE

Hmm. Tonight. 

FRED

What, you have other plans? 

ELAINE

No, no no no, none that I can, um, remember. 

JERRY

...Alright, you're locked up in a prison in Turkey, I have your wallet. The only way I can bribe the guards to get you out is for you to give me your ATM code. 

GEORGE

Call the Embassy. 

JERRY

They're closed. 

GEORGE

Why? 

JERRY

Bomb threat. 

GEORGE

We're in Turkey? 

JERRY

Midnight Express, my friend. 

GEORGE

My card won't work there; they're not on the Plus system. 

PETERMAN

You must be Jerry Seinfeld. 

JERRY

Yes, hi, Mr. Peterman. This is, uh, George Costanza. 

PETERMAN

J. Peterman. 

GEORGE

(grabbing lapels) J. Crew. 

JERRY

Well, is Elaine here? 

PETERMAN

Oh, Elaine just called, she won't be joining us. Not to worry, I'll tell the maitre'd it'll just be the three bulls. 

GEORGE

What's going on? He still wants to have dinner with us? 

JERRY

Without Elaine? What for? 

GEORGE

What, is he crazy? 

JERRY

We gotta get out of here. Come on; weave your web, liar man. 

GEORGE

I've got nothing, I-I-I-I'm blank. 

JERRY

George, what's the matter with you? 

GEORGE

I'm choking! 

PETERMAN

Ah, Fong has been most accommodating. Shall we? 

JERRY

Actually, you know I just remembered I promised this comedy club that I'd do a set tonight, so, terribly sorry. 

PETERMAN

I understand, no hard feelings. George and I will miss your company. Fong? It will just be two this evening. George, we dine. 

ELAINE

(to herself) I can't believe this, is this guy standing me up? 

PETERMAN

...And there, tucked into the river's bend was the object of my search. The Gwon-Jaya River market, fabrics and spices traded under a starlit sky. It was there that I discovered the Pamplona beret. Sizes seven-and-a-half through eight-and-three-quarters. Price? Thirty-five dollars. 

GEORGE

Howbout sports? Do you follow sports? 

ANNOUNCER

It's fourth and inches and the Giants are going for it! You gotta love sports! 

GEORGE

You know, this is very nice, but I really could take a cab. Really. 

PETERMAN

Ha ha, nonsense, George. Besides it gives me a chance to tell you about my latest trip to Burma where I discovered a very unusual corduroy. 

PETERMAN

Peterman here. What? Oh no. Alright, I'll be right there. (To George) It's my mother; she's at death's door. I just pray to God we can make it there in time. 

JERRY

I can't believe you blew us off; we were doing you the favor. 

ELAINE

Well, Fred asked me out. 

JERRY

Fred? 

ELAINE

Yeah, and then he stood me up. I don't get this guy. 

JERRY

You see what's going on here? You're attracted to him because he can't remember anything about you. 

ELAINE

I am? But that's so sick. 

JERRY

That's God's plan. He doesn't really want anyone to get together. 

ELAINE

Anyway, so how was the dinner? 

JERRY

Well, when I heard you weren't coming I made up and excuse and got the hell out of there. 

ELAINE

What about Georgie? 

JERRY

Nah, he didn't make it. 

PETERMAN

Doctor, how is she? 

DOCTOR

She's too weak to talk but she'll be happy to hear your voice. 

PETERMAN

Mama, it's me. Jacopo. I'm here for you, mama. 

GEORGE

I'm, uh, George Costanza. I was having dinner with your son. 

PETERMAN

Shake off the dew, my friend. 

GEORGE

Yeah. What time is it? 

PETERMAN

It's morning. Thanks for seeing me through the night. I'll make us a pot of coffee, George. Watch her, won't you? 

GEORGE

Who? 

PETERMAN

Momma. Just talk to her, George. The doctor seems to think it helps. 

GEORGE

Hi. I-I really should be getting back to my fianc&eacute;, you know, we, uh, we had this big fight yesterday and, uh, well she, she wants to-to know my secret code. I-I don't know, I can't tell her. The funny thing is, you know, I would really love to tell someone 'cause it's killing me. You uh, you wanna know what it is? It's Bosco. You know, the chocolate syrup? I love that stuff, I pour it in milk, it's my favorite drink. Hoo-hoo, boy, that is a relief! 

PETERMAN

Bosco. Bosco. 

GEORGE

Oh, shhh. 

PETERMAN

(sitting up) Bosco! 

PETERMAN

Bosco! Bosco! Bosco! 

GEORGE

Shut up! Shut up! 

PETERMAN

Momma! What are you trying to say? 

PETERMAN

Bosco. 

PETERMAN

She's gone. Bosco? 

GEORGE

You know this whole thing never would have happened if you hadn't bailed out on me at the restaurant. 

JERRY

I did not bail out on you. 

GEORGE

Well why couldn't you include me in your excuse? 

JERRY

Why didn't you come up with your own? 

GEORGE

I froze. I think I'm losing it. 

JERRY

Ah, c'mon. Maybe you're just in a slump? 

GEORGE

No, no. I reached down and there was *nothing* there. 

GEORGE

Now Peterman wants me to go to the funeral. 

JERRY

Oh, come on, just tell me your code already. What is it? 

GEORGE

I am not giving you my code. 

KRAMER

I'll bet I can guess it. 

GEORGE

Pssh. Yeah. Right. 

KRAMER

Oh, alright. Yeah. Uh, let's see. Um, well, we can throw out birthdays immediately. That's too obvious. And no numbers for you, you're a word man. Alright, let's go deeper. Uh, what kind of man are you? Well, you're weak, spineless, a man of temptations, but what tempts you? 

GEORGE

Huh? 

KRAMER

You're a portly fellow, a bit long in the waistband. So what's your pleasure? Is it the salty snacks you crave? No no no no no, yours is a sweet tooth. 

GEORGE

Get out of here. 

KRAMER

Oh you may stray, but you'll always return to your dark master, the cocoa bean. 

GEORGE

I'm leaving. 

KRAMER

(building up steam as George bolts for the door) No, and only the purest syrup nectar can satisfy you! 

GEORGE

I gotta go. 

KRAMER

If you could you'd guzzle it by the gallon! Ovaltine! Hershey's! 

GEORGE

Shut up! 

KRAMER

Nestl&eacute;'s Quik! 

GEORGE

Shut up! 

GEORGE

What was that? 

ELAINE

What? 

GEORGE

You just checked your watch. Are you thinking of bailing on him? 

ELAINE

I got a date. 

ELAINE

Oh, Mr. Peterman. 

PETERMAN

Oh, Elaine. George, when momma said 'Bosco' she must have been trying to communicate something, a legacy, a dying wish perhaps. 

GEORGE

Mothers say things. My mother goes babbling on and on like a crazy person. 

ELAINE

Mr. Peterman, you have my deepest sympathies. Unfortunately, I've gotta get going. 

PETERMAN

You do? 

GEORGE

Uh, yes, actually we-we both do. 

ELAINE

I have a personal commitment. 

GEORGE

Well, personal, I mean, we both uh... 

PETERMAN

What is it? 

ELAINE

I'm speaking at a women's' rights conference. 

GEORGE

Yes, and I'm speaking at a men's' conference. 

PETERMAN

I don't believe that for a minute. Well, Elaine, it was good of you to stop by. 

ELAINE

My pleasure. 

PETERMAN

Fortunately, I still have George here to help me through this. 

PETERMAN

You know George, growing up as a boy in Costa Rica, I heard a rumor that momma had taken a lover. Perhaps Bosco was this man's name. 

KRAMER

Hey, you wanna come down the fire station with me? 

JERRY

Fire station? 

KRAMER

Yeah, I made a map of my shortcuts. I'm gonna rock their world! 

JERRY

Nah, I gotta go down to Leapin' Larry's. 

KRAMER

Oh, so he took you back. 

JERRY

Yeah, we straightened it out, all is forgiven. 

KRAMER

Well, you know the important thing is that you learned something. 

JERRY

No I didn't. 

CAPTAIN

Well, Mr. Kramer, your list of short cuts is most impressive. 

KRAMER

Yeah, and this is just the Upper West Side. Wait until I get to the Village, then you're gonna see a magic show. 

CAPTAIN

Mr. Kramer, just about every week some brash young hothead like yourself saunters in here talking about faster routes and snazzier colors for the trucks, well, fact is we feel things are fine the way they are. 

JERRY

Anyway, thanks for having me back, and sorry about the misunderstanding. 

LARRY

Water under the bridge. Come on, I never did get a chance to show you around the store. 

JERRY

Oh sure. 

JERRY

Uh, again? (Limping towards the door) I'll be right there. 

DISPATCHER

Attention Company 390, structure fire at Leapin' Larry's Appliance Warehouse. 

KRAMER

Leapin' Larry's? Hey, that's uptown. You gotta take Amsterdam. 

CAPTAIN

Stay out of this, Kramer. 

KRAMER

Are you ok, cowboy? Where do you need to go? 

KRAMER

Well, you'd better take it easy. 

FRED

Sorry about the other night but my mother called, she couldn't find her pills. I had to go into Brooklyn to help her find her pills, and they were right there in the medicine cabinet. Could you believe that? 

ELAINE

Huh. 

FRED

The worst part is getting from the subway station to the house. There's no transportation... 

ELAINE

(to herself) What am I doing? I'm on a date with this guy because he didn't remember me? He's demented, listen to him... 

FRED

...I could have taken a cab but if my mother saw me pull up in a cab, she'd start yelling at me, 'Freddy! What are taking a cab for? It's so expensive!' She's out of her mind. Eventually, you'll meet her. 

PETERMAN

Bosco. Bosco. Bosco. 

PETERMAN

George! 

CAPTAIN

Gonna make a left onto Broadway. 

CAPTAIN

Who is this? 

KRAMER

It's Kramer! 

CAPTAIN

Kramer?! What the hell are you doing back there? 

KRAMER

DeSoto's down, but Cosmo's got the caboose. 

WOMAN

How did this start? 

JERRY

Beats me. 

LARRY

Where the hell's the fire department? I'm gonna lose the whole store! 

CAPTAIN

Kramer, get the hell off of there. You're not trained to operate this equipment! 

STREET

Hey, Kramer! 

LARRY

Try the scanner, see if you can pick up anything. 

CAPTAIN

What are you doing, Kramer?! You're all over the road! 

KRAMER

Don't worry, Cap, I can handle it! 

JERRY

Kramer? 

CAPTAIN

You're losing control! Hard right! Hard right! 

JERRY

Ah, that's a shame. 

PETERMAN

The fire will eat up this entire block! 

PETERMAN

Look, there's a man in there. Get out of there, you're in danger! 

MAN

But my sleeve, it's stuck in the machine, it ate my card! 

PETERMAN

George, give me your ATM card! 

GEORGE

I don't have my ATM card. 

PETERMAN

George, you're obviously lying, anyone can see that! 

PETERMAN

It's jammed! I'll slide it under the door, 

MAN

Now give me your code! 

GEORGE

What?! Why? 

MAN

The machine won't open without the code! 

PETERMAN

George, give him your code! 

GEORGE

But I-I-I- 

PETERMAN

George, there's no time! Tell him your code! Shout out your code, man!! 

MAN

The code!! The code!! 

SUSAN

Hi. Here's your cash, George. 

GEORGE

Hm. Thanks. 

SUSAN

And here's your card back. Anyone for Bosco? 

JERRY

Oh my god. Look at this. 

GEORGE

Hm? 

JERRY

It's the new J. Peterman catalog. Look. 

GEORGE

The Rogue's Wallet. That's where he kept his card, his dirty little secret. Short, devious, balding. his name was Costanza. He killed my mother. 

GEORGE

Let me ask you a question. Who would win in a fight between you and me? 

JERRY

Well, what do you mean? 

GEORGE

Well if you and I ever got into, like a really serious fight you know, and the punches started flying -- who do you think would win? 

JERRY

Well I think that's pretty obvious. 

GEORGE

Yeah. Me too. 

JERRY

Hey Elaine. 

ELAINE

Hey. 

JERRY

Who, who, who do you think would win in a fight between me and ah, gorgeous George here. (pointing up and down at George) 

ELAINE

You mean in a real Fight Fight? 

JERRY

Mona a Baldo . 

ELAINE

George. 

GEORGE

Ah-Ha! (he turns and walks over to the refrigerator) 

JERRY

Why? 

ELAINE

George fights dirty. (she sips her coffee) 

JERRY

Really? What would you do? 

GEORGE

Pull hair, Poke eyes, Groin stuff. Whatever I gotta do. (he opens a blue bottled beverage) 

JERRY

Hmm. 

ELAINE

So. Listen ... You're not doing anything tomorrow, are you? Because I have an extra ticket to the historical clothing exhibit at the Met. 

JERRY

I'm sorry. 

ELAINE

George? 

GEORGE

Would I want to see what Mary Todd wore to Lincoln's funeral? 

ELAINE

There's nobody I can go with. 

ELAINE

You know what. I don't have one female friend left. 

KRAMER

Oh, no, of course you don't. You're a Man's Woman. You hate other women, and they hate you. 

ELAINE

Thank you. 

KRAMER

So Jerry, (smacks hands and rubs palms together) What time we going to the movies? 

JERRY

Ah, how about 8:30? 

KRAMER

Saddle up and ride. (opens the fridge and pulls out some food -- takes a big bite) 

JERRY

You want to get something to eat first? 

KRAMER

(mumbling with full mouth) No, I'm good. 

GEORGE

I wonder if, ah, Susan ... (picks up the phone from the coffee table, then decides not to call) No. I better just go. (claps hands) heh. All right! See ya. (grabs his rain coat from the hook by the door and rushes out) 

KRAMER

There's nothing more pathetic, than a grown man, who's afraid of a woman . (voice get high-pitched for the last line) 

JERRY

Hey, why don't cha ask Susan? 

ELAINE

George's Susan? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

ELAINE

Yeah. Why not Susan. I should be friends with Susan. (smacks her forehead with hand) Of course! Susan! Oh! OK, I'll see you guys. Huh. (rushes out the door.) 

KRAMER

That's gunna be trouble. 

JERRY

Why? 

KRAMER

Jerry, don't you see? This world here, this is George's sanctuary. If Susan comes into contact with this world, his world's collide. You know what happens then? 

KRAMER

Ka shha shha shha Pkooo (exploding sound) 

KRAMER

Did I tell you I'm getting a new telephone number? 

JERRY

How come? 

KRAMER

Whew, chicks man. Too many chicks know my number. 

RAMON

(recognizes Jerry) Hey Jerry. How are you Mr. Backstroke? 

JERRY

Kramer this is Ramon, from the new health club I joined. 

KRAMER

Oh, yeah. 

RAMON

So you know what happened don't chu? 

JERRY

No what? 

RAMON

I got fired. 

JERRY

Really? 

RAMON

Yeah, said I put too much chlorine in the pool. 

JERRY

Ahh. 

RAMON

Hey well, ah, stay out of the deep end, eh. 

JERRY

OK, see you later. 

KRAMER

What's in the deep end? 

GEORGE

Hello? 

ELAINE

Hey George. 

GEORGE

Hey Elainie. What's going on? 

ELAINE

(sitting up in bed) Nothing much, um. Can I talk to Susan 

GEORGE

Ha, Yeah right, hang on, I'll ah, I'll get her for you. he, he, he, he. Seriously, what's up? 

ELAINE

No, George really. Can I talk to Susan? 

GEORGE

Susan, why? 

ELAINE

Because I want to ask her to lunch and to the Met tomorrow. 

GEORGE

Oh, I don't think you want to do that. 

ELAINE

Why not? 

GEORGE

Well what would be the point of that? 

ELAINE

George, are you going to put her on the phone? 

GEORGE

Where did this come from all of a sudden? 

ELAINE

George, are you going to let me talk to Susan, or Not? 

GEORGE

I really think I should have been consulted about this. 

GEORGE

Here ... something. 

SUSAN

Hello? (with hesitant surprise) Oh, that sounds great. I love that sort of stuff. 

KRAMER

You want to sit here? 

JERRY

Yeah. (Kramer sits in the seat next to Jerry) Uh, uh, oh, oh, Over there. (points to the next seat over) 

KRAMER

Why? 

JERRY

Little buffer zone. 

KRAMER

(Quietly) Buffer zone (Kramer moves to the other seat) 

JERRY

Thank you. If we were in my apartment and we were watching a movie on the couch, would we sit right next to each other? 

KRAMER

No. You got a point. 

JERRY

All right. 

KRAMER

I can't ... 

JERRY

What are you doing? 

KRAMER

Well these seats have no lumbar. 

JERRY

Oh hey, there's Ramon. Pre, pretend we're talking. 

KRAMER

We are talking. 

JERRY

Pretend it's interesting. 

KRAMER

So, ah then, I ah had to kill him and ah, well the police are still looking for me. 

JERRY

That's shocking, but sounds ... 

RAMON

Hey, hi Jerry. 

JERRY

Oh, hey Ramon. 

RAMON

Hey, hey, I took a bunch of napkins. You want some? 

JERRY

Oh, no thanks. (turns back to Kramer) 

RAMON

Hey, ahhh, is this seat taken? 

JERRY

No. 

JERRY

And then the worst part is, after the movie, he leached on to us ... We wound up having coffee with him for like two hours. Then he walks us home, all the way back to the front of the building. Finally I said, look Ramon, I gotta go to bed now. 

GEORGE

By the way, have you spoken to Elaine yet today? 

JERRY

No why? 

GEORGE

(sighs) She called Susan last night. 

JERRY

Oh yeah, I know. 

GEORGE

How do you know? 

JERRY

Well it was my idea. 

GEORGE

Your idea? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

GEORGE

Wha'd you do that for? 

JERRY

She was looking for someone to go to the show with. 

GEORGE

Well that was a really stupid thing! You know what's going to happen now? 

JERRY

World's collide. (points at George) 

GEORGE

Whe ... Well yeah! 

JERRY

Because this world is your sanctuary and if that world comes into contact with -- 

GEORGE

YES! It Blows Up! If you knew that, what did you tell Elaine for? 

JERRY

I didn't know. Kramer told me about the worlds. 

GEORGE

You couldn't figure out the 'World's Theory' for yourself? It's just common sense. Anybody knows, ya gotta keep your worlds apart. (gesturing with hands going outward) 

JERRY

Yeah, I guess I slipped up. 

KRAMER

Hey. 

GEORGE

Hey. 

JERRY

Hey. 

GEORGE

He knows the worlds theory. 

KRAMER

What is it blowing up? 

GEORGE

Ha! (grabs his coat and exits the apartment) 

KRAMER

Cosmo, go. No, no, na, na. (he pushes the end button and pushes the antenna down) Boy this new telephone number's driving me crazy -- wrong numbers, every five minutes. 

JERRY

What is it? 

KRAMER

Well it's 555-3455. 

JERRY

555-3455. 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

JERRY

(picks up the phone on the coffee table) '555-3455.' Well wait a second, don't you see that's 555-FILK. 

KRAMER

What's Filk? 

JERRY

Filk's nothing, but 555-FILM is Movie Phone. 

KRAMER

Oh Movie Phone. 

JERRY

Yes, so people are just dialing it by mistake and getting you. 

KRAMER

So, I'm Filk? 

JERRY

You're Filk. 

KRAMER

Oh, Mama. 

ELAINE

Well what about that number Susan B. Anthony wore to the 19th Amendment party. Hnuh. Eye yye yye. 

SUSAN

Oh whoo. Quite the D&egrave;Colletage for a suffragette. 

ELAINE

Ha, ha, ha, ha, well it must have been one hell of a party. 

SUSAN

Whoo. 

ELAINE

Ha, ha, ha, ha. 

SUSAN

Oh, I know what I wanted to tell you. 

ELAINE

What? 

SUSAN

Ehahh, forget it. 

ELAINE

What? You can tell me. I'll put it in the vault. 

SUSAN

The vault? 

ELAINE

Mm-Hmm. 

JERRY

Oh, well, I didn't actually go with Ramon. I just bumped into him there. (putting on coat) 

PAUL

Tell him to call us. 

DUSTIN

Tell him, Dustin says, 'Hello.' 

JERRY

All right, I gotta go. 

PAUL

To see Ramon? 

JERRY

What else did you two do? 

ELAINE

Oh, I don't know, you know, girlie stuff. 

JERRY

Ah, so, ah, flower shows and, shopping for pretty bows, and then back to her place, strip down to bra and panties for a tickle fight? 

ELAINE

That's really what you think girls do, isn't it? 

JERRY

Yes, I do. (very serious) 

ELAINE

All rightee. (turns and walks to the bathroom) 

JERRY

Hey you know George isn't to happy, ahh, about your new friendship. 

ELAINE

Yeah? Well I don't really give a Sh... (closing the bathroom door) 

KRAMER

Hey man, what's going on? 

JERRY

Hey. 

KRAMER

Ooh, here we go. (pulls a cordless phone from his pocket) Yeah hello. Yeah, no, no, no, hold on. 

KRAMER

Yeah, Cupid's Rifle -- 8:30, Sony Lincoln Square. Yeah, no, no, no, no problem, yeah. 

JERRY

You're looking up movies for people now? 

KRAMER

I got time. 

KRAMER

And this. (pulls out the cordless phone from his pocket) Cosmo here. Yeah, un-huh, no, no, no, no, I'll help. Yeah, Firestorm's good. I saw it yesterday. Yeah well my buddy Jerry , ah, he's seen it twice. You want to talk to him? Here -- (holds the phone out to Jerry) 

JERRY

(shaking his head no) No Kramer I don't want to talk to him. 

KRAMER

Just, just tell him about the picture. What's the matter with you? Stop it. (puts the phone back to his ear) Yes, are you still there? Look I'm sorry about that. All right there's an 8:30 and a 10:15showing. 

JERRY

Oh that's George. (presses the intercom button) Yeah? 

RAMON

(Hey it's Ramon) 

JERRY

What? 

RAMON

(Hey, It's Ramon Jerry. I'm coming up) 

JERRY

(to Ramon) Oh. Okay. (to Elaine) Wh, what is he doing here? 

ELAINE

Who? Who is Ramon? 

JERRY

He's the pool guy. 

ELAINE

What pool guy? 

JERRY

Do me a favor. Just stick around while he's here. 

ELAINE

Yeah, no problem. 

ELAINE

You know, you have the slowest elevator in the entire city? That's hard to get used to when you're in so many other fast ones. 

JERRY

Well, the apartment elevators are always slower than the offices, because you don't have to be home on time. 

RAMON

Hee hey, hey Jerry (claps hands and points both index fingers at him) How are you, crazy guy? 

JERRY

Hey. So, ah, Ramon this is my friend Elaine. 

ELAINE

Yeah and I was just leaving. Bye-bye Jerry. (smiling as she closes the door. Jerry looks at her like he can not believe she left him on his own) 

JERRY

So, ah, what are you doing around here Ramon? 

RAMON

Well, I was in the neighborhood. I figured I'd check you out. 

JERRY

Ah, actually, I ka, kinda had some things to do. 

RAMON

Oh, oh yeah. Wha? Where you going? 

JERRY

Ah, just, you know, I don't know. Stuff, I gotta do. (grabs coat and throws it over his shoulder) 

RAMON

Hey that's cool. I'm up for some stuff 

JERRY

All right. 

RAMON

So get this. I get down there, and right away, I see the drain is clogged. I mean it's obvious. Can you believe it? 

JERRY

All right Ramon, I'm going to get going. 

JERRY

I think we should separate here actually. 

RAMON

What are you trying to say Jerry? 

JERRY

Look Ramon, you're, you're a nice guy. But I, I actually only have three friends. I really can't handle any more. 

RAMON

Oh I see. It's cause I clean pools, right? 

JERRY

That has nothing to do with it. 

RAMON

You su -- (no audio) (through the moving subway window, Ramon is swearing and pointing at Jerry) 

SUSAN

Yeah, we got along real well. 

GEORGE

You know, uh, she has no female friends! You know that, don't cha? Something strange about a woman who's friends are all men. 

SUSAN

Yeah, I know. We talked all about that. 

GEORGE

You talked all about that? 

SUSAN

Oh yeah. Elaine opened up her vault. 

GEORGE

Did you just say vault? 

SUSAN

Yeah, why? Did I use it wrong? 

GEORGE

You got that from Elaine. 

SUSAN

Yeah. So what? 

GEORGE

Well it's a little strange. You going to start to talk like Elaine from now on? 

SUSAN

I don't know. Anyway I thought we'd all go to a movie on Friday. 

GEORGE

We'd all go to movie on Friday? 

SUSAN

Yeah. 

GEORGE

This is not good. World's are colliding! George is getting upset! 

GEORGE

Ah you have no idea of the magnitude of this thing. If she is allowed to infiltrate this world, then George Costanza as you know him, Ceases to Exist! You see, right now, I have Relationship George, but there is also Independent George. That's the George you know, the George you grew up with -- Movie George, Coffee shop George, Liar George, Bawdy George. 

JERRY

I, I love that George. 

GEORGE

Me Too! And he's Dying Jerry! If Relationship George walks through this door, he will Kill Independent George! A George, divided against itself, Cannot Stand! 

GEORGE

You're Killing Independent George! You know that, don't you? 

ELAINE

George I don't even want to get -- 

GEORGE

You know what word Susan used last night? Hnuh. Vault! hu, 

ELAINE

So? 

GEORGE

She got that from you! 

ELAINE

Well, I didn't tell here to say it. 

GEORGE

Is she the only girl in the whole world? Why can't you get find your own girl? 

ELAINE

I Like Her! 

GEORGE

You see (to Jerry). You see. You see what I'm talking about. It's all just slipping away. And you're letting it happen. (exits -- slamming the door) 

JERRY

So you want to catch a movie later? 

ELAINE

Ahh, yeah, sure. 

JERRY

I don't have a paper though. 

ELAINE

Hmm. (picks up the phone and dials) 

KRAMER

Hewwo and welcome to Movie phone. Brought to you by the New York Times and Hot 97. Coming to theaters this Friday ... Kevin Bacon, Susan Sarandon -- 'You've got to get me over that mountain!' 'Now' (bang, bang) 'AHHHHHHHHHH' There is no place higher than ... Mountain High . Rated R. If you know the name of the movie you'd like to see, press 1. 

ELAINE

Kramer, is that you? 

KRAMER

Elaine? 

ELAINE

Uh, what time does Chow Fun start? 

KRAMER

I don't know. 

RAMON

Well, well. Look who's here. 

JERRY

Ramon, what are you doing here? You could get in trouble. 

RAMON

No, I don't think so Jerry. You see they gave me my job back. 

JERRY

What? 

RAMON

I'm a pool boy ... again. 

JERRY

Look Ramon, about the other day. I'm sorry if I offended you. I get a little crabby on the subway. 

RAMON

Do you? 

JERRY

What happened to all the towels? 

RAMON

Oh, ah, I guess they must have disappeared. (walks away) 

NEWMAN

Hey Jerry. Look at all the towels they gave me! I really hit the jackpot! (holding a large stack of towels, Newman pats his face with the top one) Ha, ha, ha. 

JERRY

It's been a terrible situation down there the past couple of days. He's really been making things uncomfortable for me. There's always a big pile of dirty towels in front of my locker ... 

ELAINE

Uh-huh. 

JERRY

And then when I come out of the pool, my towel's always gone. 

ELAINE

Uhh, so frustrating! 

JERRY

Tell me about it. 

ELAINE

Uhh, so you want to join me and Susan for lunch at the coffee shop? 

JERRY

You're meeting Susan for lunch at the coffee shop? 

ELAINE

Yeah. 

JERRY

I'm meeting George for lunch at the coffee shop. 

ELAINE

Oh, huh. Well, this should be very interesting. 

SUSAN

Hey! Elaine! Jerry. Over here! 

KRAMER

There they are. 

SUSAN

Yeah, look who I ran into. 

KRAMER

Hey. 

ELAINE

Yeah. (sits down next to Susan) 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

ELAINE

Ahh. 

KRAMER

Come on Jerry. Aren't you going to join us? 

JERRY

Ah, you know. I'm supposed to meet, eh, someone -- I'll, I'll wait for them outside. (walks towards the door) 

KRAMER

Yeah, wait here. Come on, sit down. What's the matter with you? 

JERRY

This is gonna to be ugly. (quietly) 

SUSAN

What's that Jerry? 

JERRY

(coughing) I said, boy am I ugly. 

SUSAN

Oh, hey, hey, Georgie boy, over here. 

GEORGE

One, two ... three, four. 

GEORGE

Ha Ho! (he turns and walks out the door) 

SUSAN

Hey George! 

JERRY

We'll pull up another chair. 

JERRY

I see you there Ramon. 

JERRY

Hey, l'll just keep swimming. Hey, hey. I'm not done. I know what you're up to Ramon. Because I'm a member here, this is my place to swim. 

JERRY

Hey, you better cut it out Ramon. Just stop it. 

RAMON

Oh. 

NEWMAN

Olly, olly, oxen, free! 

JERRY

(NO!) 

JERRY

I think he's gonna need, mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. 

NEWMAN

Mouth-to-mouth? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

NEWMAN

Huh. 

JERRY

Well? Go ahead. 

NEWMAN

You go. 

JERRY

You knocked him out. 

NEWMAN

Yeah, but you pulled him in. 

JERRY

Come on Newman. Do it. 

NEWMAN

Nah. 

JERRY

He might die. 

NEWMAN

Yeah. Maybe. 

ELAINE

(on the phone to) Look Jerry, we'll meet you at the theater. (hangs up the phone) OK, next showings at 9:00, we can't wait any longer. 

SUSAN

Elaine, where could he be? It's not like George to just disappear. 

ELAINE

Look, let's just leave him a note, okay? 

SUSAN

Oh, I don't know. 

ELAINE

Oh, come on, come on, come on. (picks up pad of paper and writes) 'George, Elaine and I went to see Chunnel ... with Jerry.' Love? 

SUSAN

Yeah. 

ELAINE

'Love ... Susan.' 

JERRY

So eventually these people came and, somebody, gave him mouth-to-mouth. 

ELAINE

He could have died 

JERRY

Yeah, it was a gamble. 

SUSAN

Why didn't you give him mouth-to-mouth? 

JERRY

Ah. (makes face) 

ELAINE

How can you possibly show your face there again? 

JERRY

Oh I can't. They revoked my membership. Newman too. You know, we can't go anywhere near there. 

ELAINE

Hi, ah, three for Chunnel -- two adults ... one child. (looking towards Jerry) 

GEORGE

What the hell is this? 'George, Elaine and I went to see Chunnel ... with Jerry.' With Jerry, huh? With Jerry! Great. Great! (dials phone) Probably went to the 84th St. That's where I always go with Jerry. 

KRAMER

Hewwo and welcome to Movie phone. If you know the name of the movie you'd like to see, press one.

KRAMER

KRAMER

GEORGE

Yeah, now I gotcha! (hangs up the phone and rushes out the door) 

KRAMER

It's also playing in theater number two at 9:00. 

GEORGE

Jerry ... Where are you? I know you like to sit back here. Elaine! Susan! 

PATRON

SHH! 

JERRY

I can't figure out what's going on here. I can't follow the plot. Why did they kill that guy? I thought he was with them? 

SUSAN

No, no. That's not the guy. That's a different guy. 

JERRY

What is he doing in the Chunnel? 

SUSAN

Would you two, Please? 

GEORGE

Susan! Jerry! Where are you? I know you're there! Answer me! 

PATRON

(Hey, sit down!) 

GEORGE

Hey. Hey. Answer me! Come on, show yourselves! 

PATRON

(Hey, we're trying to watch a movie here!) 

GEORGE

Drink your soda! Come on! I know you're there, laughing at me. Laughing and lying and laughing! I had to go to Reggies, Jerry! Reggies! 

PATRON

(Move it off of there!) 

GEORGE

Where are you! 

PATRON

(Hey are you sure you got the right theater?) 

GEORGE

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Chunnel . Susan! 

PATRON

(It's playing in two theaters.) 

GEORGE

Two theaters? 

PATRON

(Yeah, there's a 9:00 too.) 

GEORGE

Oh. Sorry. 

ELAINE

I thought that was pretty good, huh? 

JERRY

Wha'd you think Susan? 

SUSAN

Oh, I don't know. I couldn't hear anything. You, you talked the whole movie. 

ELAINE

Oh, well come on. You want to go grab a bite to eat? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

SUSAN

Ah, no. I don't think so. 

ELAINE

Why not? 

SUSAN

Well you know, all you guys ever do is sit around the coffee shop talking, sit around Jerry's apartment talking. Frankly, I don't know how you can stand it. I'll see you. 

GEORGE

I know they're in there, the three of them, laughing at me. Together, laughing and lying. 

USHER

Let's go pal. 

GEORGE

They're -- They're killing independent George! And they're, they're all in on it! World's are colliding! 

GUY

Hello, and welcome to your worst nightmare. 

GUY

(con't) I know your in there, Cosmo Kramer, Apartment 5B. You're in big trouble, Now. You've been sealing my business. If you'd like to do this the easy way, open the door, Now. Or, please select the number of seconds, you'd like to wait, before I break this door down. Please select Now. 

KRAMER

Hey, boys and girls. I need you both to sponsor me in the AIDS walk. 

ELAINE

Is that tomorrow? 

KRAMER

Yeah, yeah, so...git-git...(gestures to Elaine to sign the form.) 

ELAINE

Well, I admire you for joining the fight against AIDS. 

KRAMER

Well, if I didn't do something I wouldn't be able to live with myself. 

JERRY

It's hard enough living next door. 

KRAMER

I tell ya, there's some people, they just wear a ribbon and they think they're doin' something? Not me. I talk the talk, and I walk the walk, baby. (gets up) I'll be right back. 

ELAINE

New jeans? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

ELAINE

Still a 31 waist? 

JERRY

Yep. Since college. (Looks at Kramer's AIDS walk list.) Hey, Lena Small's on this list. 

ELAINE

Lena Small? 

JERRY

Yeah, that girl I was gonna call for a date, she was unlisted...and now here's her number. 

ELAINE

Oh, you're not gonna cop a girl's phone number off an AIDS charity list! 

JERRY

Elaine, you should admire me...I'm aspiring to date a giving person. 

ELAINE

You're a taking person. 

JERRY

That's why I should date a giving person. If I date a taking person, everyone's taking, taking, taking, no one's giving - it's bedlam. 

ELAINE

She's gonna ask how you got her number. 

JERRY

Oh, I'll tell her I met some guy who knew her and he gave it to me. 

ELAINE

What's he look like? 

JERRY

I really didn't pay much attention, I'd just come from buying a speedboat. 

ELAINE

You're buying a speedboat? 

JERRY

See, we're already off the subject of how I got her number. (Elaine laughs.) All I gotta do is get past the first phone call and I'm home free. 

ELAINE

I don't know about that. 

JERRY

So if Billy had gotten your number off the AIDS walk list, you wouldn't have gone out with him? 

ELAINE

Well... 

JERRY

Yeah. So you really like this guy. 

ELAINE

Very much. 

JERRY

How's the...sexual chemistry? 

ELAINE

Haven't been in the lab yet. But I am birth control shopping today. (Kramer overhears as he returns to the booth.) 

KRAMER

Are you still on the pill? 

ELAINE

Uh, Kramer... 

KRAMER

I'll tell ya, I think birth control should be discussed in an open forum. 

ELAINE

The sponge, o.k.? The Today sponge. 

KRAMER

But wasn't that taken off the market? 

ELAINE

Off the market? The sponge? No, no...no way. Everybody loves the sponge. 

KRAMER

I read it in Wall Street Week ...Louis, uh, Rukeyser. 

JERRY

Hello, Lena? Hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld. How did I get your number? I met a guy that knows you, he gave it to me...I don't remember his name. Think it began with a W, maybe a Q. I wasn't paying that much attention, I'd just come from shopping for a speedboat... 

SUSAN

You know, I really like those new jeans Jerry was wearing. He's really thin. 

GEORGE

Not as thin as you think. 

SUSAN

Why? He's a 31. I saw the tag on the back. 

GEORGE

The tag, huh? 

SUSAN

Mmm-hmm. 

GEORGE

Let me tell you something about that tag. It's no 31, and uh...let's just leave it at that. 

SUSAN

What are you talking about? 

GEORGE

He scratches off a 32 and he puts in 31. 

SUSAN

Oh, how could he be so vain? 

GEORGE

Well, this is the Jerry Seinfeld that only I know. I can't believe I just told you that. 

SUSAN

Why not? 

GEORGE

Well, Jerry doesn't want anyone to know. 

SUSAN

Well, it's alright, I'm your fiance. Everyone assumes you'll tell me everything. 

GEORGE

Where did you get that from? 

SUSAN

Well, we're a couple. It's understood. 

GEORGE

I never heard of that. 

SUSAN

Well, you've never been a couple. 

GEORGE

I've coupled! I've coupled! 

SUSAN

Keeping secrets! This is just like your secret bank code. 

GEORGE

This is totally different! That was my secret, this is Jerry's secret! There's...there's attorney-client priveleges here! If I play it by your rule, no one'll ever confide in me again, I'll be cut out of the loop! 

GEORGE

Hey. 

JERRY

Hey. What's the matter? 

GEORGE

I had a fight with Susan. 

JERRY

What about? 

GEORGE

Oh...(is about to tell Jerry, but reconsiders) ...clothing, something, I dunno. So, uh, what are you doing today? 

JERRY

I got a date with that girl, Lena. 

GEORGE

Lena, how'd you meet her? 

JERRY

I actually met her a few weeks ago, but... (Jerry stops, and mentally visualizes George telling Susan about how Jerry got Lena's number from the AIDS list...then Susan passing the information along to Monica on the phone at work.) 

GEORGE

You met her a few weeks ago, but...? 

JERRY

I didn't call her till today. 

GEORGE

So, uh...wanna double? 

JERRY

What? 

GEORGE

Well, I just had a fight - I need a group dynamic. 

JERRY

I dunno. (Elaine enters.) Hey. 

ELAINE

Well, Kramer was right. My friend Kim told me the sponge is off the market. 

JERRY

So what are you gonna do? 

ELAINE

I'll tell you what I'm gonna do - I'm gonna do a hard-target search. Of every drug store, general store, health store and grocery store in a 25-block radius. 

GEORGE

Just for these sponges? 

ELAINE

Hey man, women are really loyal to their birth control methods. What does Susan use? 

GEORGE

I dunno. 

ELAINE

You don't know? 

GEORGE

I, uh...figure it's something. (Kramer enters.) 

JERRY

What are you all out of breath from? 

KRAMER

The elevator just broke. I had to walk up five flights. 

JERRY

And you got the AIDS walk tomorrow. You're never gonna make it, you're in horrible shape. 

KRAMER

Hey, I'm in tip-top shape. Better than you! 

JERRY

I got a 31 waist, mister! 

KRAMER

Yeah, well I'm walking for charity, what are you doing? 

JERRY

What am I doing? I'm...dating a woman who happens to be sponsoring one of these walkers. 

PHARMACIST

Can I help you? 

ELAINE

Yeah, do you have any Today sponges? I know they're off the market, but... 

PHARMACIST

Actually, we have a case left. 

ELAINE

A case! A case of sponges? I mean, uh...a case. Huh. Uh...how many come in a case? 

PHARMACIST

Sixty. 

ELAINE

Sixty?! Uh...well, I'll take three. 

PHARMACIST

Three. 

ELAINE

Make it ten. 

PHARMACIST

Ten? 

ELAINE

Twenty sponges should be plenty. 

PHARMACIST

Did you say twenty? 

ELAINE

Yeah, twenty-five sponges is just fine. 

PHARMACIST

Right. So, you're set with twenty-five. 

ELAINE

Yeah. Just give me the whole case and I'll be on my way. 

JERRY

Hey, I have found the best-smelling detergent. Lena, smell my shirt. 

LENA

Mmm! Very nice. 

JERRY

It's All-Tempa-Cheer. 

LENA

I use Planet. It's bio-degradable and doesn't pollute the oceans. 

GEORGE

Yeah, the oceans really are getting very sudsy. 

LENA

Can you wrap up all the left-overs on the table, please? I always take the left-overs. I work in a soup kitchen every morning at 6 a.m. 

JERRY

They serve soup at 6 a.m.? 

LENA

Yeah. That's all they have. 

JERRY

Do the bums ever complain? 'Soup again?' 

GEORGE

I'd get tired of it. 

JERRY

How could you not? 

LENA

Guess who volunteered last week? 

GEORGE

Mick Jagger. 

LENA

No. Maya Angelou. 

SUSAN

Oh, the poet! 

JERRY

So, let me ask you something - these people eat soup three times a day? 

LENA

I don't know. 

SUSAN

So, did you get to talk to her? 

LENA

Talk to who? 

JERRY

Is it a lot of cream soups? 

SUSAN

Maya Angelou, the poet. 

LENA

No, I didn't get the chance. 

GEORGE

Oh, well, I'm sure you can reach her...she's a poet. What does a poet need an unlisted number for? 

SUSAN

I'm going to the ladies room. 

LENA

I'll go with you. (They leave.) 

GEORGE

What are you looking at me like that for? 

JERRY

Why'd you have to mention 'unlisted number'? 

GEORGE

What are you talking about? 

JERRY

Alright, I gotta tell you something, but you cannot tell Susan. 

SUSAN

Jerry got her phone number off of an AIDS walk list? Oh, that's awful! 

GEORGE

I know, but don't say anything to anyone. He told me not to tell you. 

SUSAN

But you told me anyway? 

GEORGE

Well, you know, I was thinking about what you said before, and...you're right, I've never really been a couple, so...if that's the rule, then I'm gonna go by the rule. 

SUSAN

Thank you, honey. 

GEORGE

So, you wanna go home and...make up, officially? 

SUSAN

Can we stop by a drug store first? 

GEORGE

What for? 

SUSAN

I'm out of birth control stuff. 

GEORGE

Oh, o.k., yeah. Where am I gonna park here...? (Pulls over.) 

SUSAN

Oh, don't park. I'll just sit in the car, you can run in. 

GEORGE

Me run in? Why don't you run in? 

SUSAN

You don't know what I use for birth control, do you? 

GEORGE

Of course I do. 

SUSAN

You do? What? 

GEORGE

You know. You use the, uh...(mutters something unintelligible under his breath.) 

SUSAN

The what? 

GEORGE

You know, the uh...(mutters it again.) 

SUSAN

Just get me some sponges, please. 

GEORGE

Wait, wait a minute...they don't have them anymore. I just found out, they just took them off the market. 

SUSAN

Off the market? The sponge? 

GEORGE

Yeah, so you gotta use something else. 

SUSAN

I can't! I love the sponge! I need the sponge! 

GEORGE

O.k....(thinks) I think I know where we can get one. 

JERRY

Kramer, what the hell is going on in there? 

KRAMER

It's a poker game...(yells to the crowd) And I'm kickin' some serious butt! 

JERRY

Are you out of your mind? You got the AIDS walk tomorrow! 

GAME

Hey, Kramer - are you in? 

KRAMER

Oh, you gotta be kiddin'! You see those two ladies I got showin'? Do they look scared?! 

JERRY

You're never gonna make it! 

BILLY

You, uh...you wanna go in the bedroom? 

ELAINE

O.k. Hold on just a second. (Gets up and heads to the bathroom. George knocks at the door.) 

GEORGE

Elaine? It's me, George. (Elaine opens the door.) Hey, sorry to bother you so late. (To Billy) Hey! How ya doin.' (To Elaine) Uh, did you get any of those sponges? 

ELAINE

Yeah. Cleaned out the whole west side. Why? 

GEORGE

Well...Susan. 

ELAINE

Ah, Susan uses the sponge. 

GEORGE

Susan loves the sponge. 

ELAINE

Yeah, I'm sorry, George. I can't help you out. 

GEORGE

What? 

ELAINE

I can't do it. No way, there's no how. (Tries to push George out the door. George resists.) 

GEORGE

Elaine...let me just explain something to you. See, this is not just a weekend routine...I'm on the verge of make-up sex here. You know about make-up sex? 

ELAINE

Oh yeah, I know all about make-up sex, and I'm really sorry. (Shoves George into the hallway and closes the door. George blocks the door with his foot.) 

GEORGE

Elaine, can I just explain something to you very privately here? Susan and I have been together many, many times now, and just between you and me, there's really no big surprises here, so...make-up sex is all that I have left. 

ELAINE

I'm sure you'll have another fight, George. (Stamps on George's foot and closes the door.) (To Billy) Hold that thought! 

SUSAN

So, listen to this. But don't tell anyone - Jerry Seinfeld? He got a woman's number off an AIDS walk list. 

MONICA

He got her number off an AIDS walk list? 

LENA

He what? 

JERRY

How'd you find out? 

LENA

A friend of a friend of a friend of Susan's. 

JERRY

George! 

LENA

Pardon? 

JERRY

Nothing. Listen, I'm sorry, I just - 

LENA

It's o.k.! There's nothing to be sorry about. I don't mind. 

JERRY

You don't mind that I got your number off the AIDS walk list? 

LENA

No, not at all. No problem. (Jerry looks at Lena suspiciously. Lena leaves with all of Kramer's poker buddies, who are filing out of Kramer's apartment.) 

KRAMER

Ah, you're lucky you're walkin' out of here with a pair of pants on! 

JERRY

You went all night? 

KRAMER

Jerry, ah? Breakfast on me, huh? 

JERRY

Kramer, are you out of your mind? You got the AIDS walk in like, three hours! You're never gonna make it! 

KRAMER

AIDS walk! That's a cake walk. (George enters.) Hey! 

JERRY

So, George, guess what? Lena found out how I got her number. 

GEORGE

Really? How'd she do that? 

JERRY

A friend of a friend of Susan's. 

GEORGE

My Susan? 

JERRY

Why'd you tell her?! 

GEORGE

Because, Jerry, it's a couple rule! We have to tell each other everything! 

JERRY

Well you know what this means, don't you? 

GEORGE

What? 

JERRY

You're cut off, you're out of the loop! 

GEORGE

You're cutting me off? No, no, no Jerry, don't cut me off! 

JERRY

You leave me no choice! You're the media now as far as I'm concerned! 

GEORGE

C'mon Jerry, please! It won't happen again. 

JERRY

If you were in the mafia, would you tell her every time you killed someone? 

GEORGE

Hey, a 'hit' is a totally different story. 

JERRY

I don't know, George. 

GEORGE

So, Lena was upset, huh? 

JERRY

You know what? That was the amazing thing. 

GEORGE

What, it didn't bother her? 

JERRY

No, she said it was fine. There's something very strange about this girl. 

GEORGE

What? 

JERRY

She's too good. 

GEORGE

Too good... 

JERRY

I mean, she's giving and caring and genuinely concerned about the welfare of others - I can't be with someone like that! 

GEORGE

I see what you mean. 

JERRY

I mean, I admire the hell out of her. You can't have sex with someone you admire. 

GEORGE

Where's the depravity? 

JERRY

No depravity! I mean, I look at her, I can't imagine she even has sex. 

JERRY

On the other hand... 

ELAINE

What? 

GEORGE

Thanks again for last night! 

ELAINE

Hey, I didn't even use one. 

JERRY

I thought you said it was imminent. 

ELAINE

Yeah, it was, but then I just couldn't decide if he was really sponge-worthy. 

JERRY

Sponge-worthy? 

ELAINE

Yeah, Jerry, I have to conserve these sponges. 

JERRY

But you like this guy, isn't that what the sponges are for? 

ELAINE

Yes, yes - before they went off the market. I mean, now I've got to re-evaluate my whole screening process. I can't afford to waste any of 'em. 

GEORGE

You know, you're nuts with these sponges. George is gettin' frustrated! 

KRAMER

Uh, Cosmo Kramer? 

ORGANIZER

Uh...o.k., you're checked in. Here's your AIDS ribbon. 

KRAMER

Uh, no thanks. 

ORGANIZER

You don't want to wear an AIDS ribbon? 

KRAMER

No. 

ORGANIZER

But you have to wear an AIDS ribbon. 

KRAMER

I have to? 

ORGANIZER

Yes. 

KRAMER

See, that's why I don't want to. 

ORGANIZER

But everyone wears the ribbon. You must wear the ribbon! 

KRAMER

You know what you are? You're a ribbon bully. (Walks away.) 

ORGANIZER

Hey you! Come back here! Come back here and put this on! 

GEORGE

Elaine and her sponges...she's got like, a war chest full of them. 

SUSAN

Well, I don't see why you just can't use condoms. 

GEORGE

Oh, no, no...condoms are for single men. The day that we got engaged, I said goodbye to the condom forever. 

SUSAN

Just once...for the make-up sex. 

GEORGE

Make-up sex? You have to have that right after the fight, we're way past that. 

SUSAN

Come on, just once? 

GEORGE

No, no...I hate the condom. 

SUSAN

Why? 

GEORGE

I can never get the package open in time. 

SUSAN

Well, you just tear it open. 

GEORGE

It's not that easy. It's like 'Beat The Clock,' there's a lot of pressure there. 

KRAMER

Oh, I don't wear the ribbon. 

KRAMER

Yeah, I'm against AIDS. I mean, I'm walking, aren't I? I just don't wear the ribbon. 

BOB

Who? Who does not want to wear the ribbon? (Kramer is frightened.) 

ELAINE

So, you think you're sponge-worthy? 

BILLY

Yes, I think I'm sponge-worthy. I think I'm very sponge-worthy. 

ELAINE

Run down your case for me again...? 

BILLY

Well, we've gone out several times, we obviously have a good rapport. I own a very profitable electronics distributing firm. I eat well. I exercise. Blood tests - immaculate. And if I can speak frankly, I'm actually quite good at it. 

ELAINE

You going to do something about your sideburns? 

BILLY

Yeah, I told you...I'm going to trim my sideburns. 

ELAINE

And the bathroom in your apartment? 

BILLY

Cleaned it this morning. 

ELAINE

The sink, the tub, everything got cleaned? 

BILLY

Everything, yeah. It's spotless. 

ELAINE

Alright, let's go. (They head for the bedroom.) 

JERRY

Hi. 

LENA

Hi! Hey, look at this - I just got a citation in the mail for my work with shut-ins. 

JERRY

Oh, the shut-ins, that's nice. You know, they're a very eccentric group. Because they're shut in. Of course, they're not locked in, they're free to go at anytime. 

LENA

Oh, by the way, I checked at the soup kitchen - they do have cream soups. 

JERRY

Hey, that's dynamite. You know, Lena, I wanted to talk to you about something...you know, because you're such a good person - 

LENA

Oh, hang onto that thought - I'm rinsing a sweater, I left the water running. (Goes into the bathroom.) Hey, Jerry, can you get me a towel out of my bedroom closet? 

JERRY

Oh, o.k. (Goes to the closet for the towel and finds dozens of boxes of Today sponges.) 

LENA

Thanks. So, you were saying...? 

JERRY

What? Nothing. 

LENA

No, you said I was a good person... 

JERRY

Oh... 

LENA

You seem like you want to tell me something. 

JERRY

Tell you something...I do. 

LENA

What is it, Jerry? You can tell me anything. 

JERRY

Oh, uh...you see these jeans I'm wearing? 

LENA

Yeah. 

JERRY

I change the 32 waist on the label to a 31 on all my jeans. So, you know. That's it. (Lena is puzzled.) 

SUSAN

Come on, George, just tear it open. 

GEORGE

I'm trying, dammit. 

SUSAN

Tear it. 

GEORGE

I tried to tear it from the side, you can't get a good grip here. You gotta do it like a bag of chips. 

SUSAN

Here give it to me. 

GEORGE

Would you wait a second? Just wait? (They fight over it.) 

SUSAN

Give it to me. (She rips it open.) Come on. Come on! 

GEORGE

It's too late. 

BOB

So! What's it going to be? Are you going to wear the ribbon? 

KRAMER

No! Never. 

BOB

But I am wearing the ribbon. He is wearing the ribbon. We are all wearing the ribbon! So why aren't you going to wear the ribbon!? 

KRAMER

This is America! I don't have to wear anything I don't want to wear! 

CEDRIC

What are we gonna do with him? 

BOB

I guess we are just going to have to teach him to wear the ribbon! 

JERRY

It completely turned her off. 

GEORGE

Well, I can see that. What do you have to do that for? Who cares about your pants size? 

JERRY

I don't wanna be a 32. 

GEORGE

I'd kill to be a 32. 

JERRY

She said I wasn't sponge-worthy. Wouldn't waste a sponge on me! 

GEORGE

That condom killed me. Why do they have to make the wrappers on those things so hard to open? 

JERRY

It's probably so the woman has one last chance to change her mind. 

GEORGE

You never run out, do you? (Jerry smiles.) Where's Kramer? Everything's finished here. 

JERRY

Oh, I told him he'd never make it. He was up all night! Oh my god...Kramer? 

JERRY

Look at you. I told you. Up all night playing poker. Come on. (Jerry and George are about to leave. George turn's back and looks at Kramer.) 

GEORGE

Hey, where's you AIDS ribbon? 

ELAINE

Good morning. 

BILLY

How'd you sleep? 

ELAINE

Great. You? 

BILLY

Fine, fine. Everything o.k.? 

ELAINE

Yep. 

BILLY

No regrets? 

ELAINE

Nope. (Billy leans in to kiss her.) What are you doing? 

BILLY

What do you mean? 

ELAINE

Oh...I don't think so. 

BILLY

Why not? I thought you said everything was fine. 

ELAINE

I wish I could help you, but I can't afford two of 'em. (Pats Billy on the shoulder and gets out of bed.) 

GEORGE

You think she's happy? 

JERRY

Who? 

GEORGE

(indicates with his head) The cashier. 

JERRY

Ruthie Cohen? 

GEORGE

(surprised) You know her name? 

JERRY

Sure. 

GEORGE

I don't think I've ever spoken to her. 

JERRY

Maybe that's why she's happy. 

KRAMER

(handing Jerry & George a flyer) Good morning, gentlemen. 

JERRY

What is this? 

KRAMER

(removing his coat) Yeah, well, it's the latest offering from the Alex Theatre. 

JERRY

That stinky old movie-house? 

KRAMER

(sits beside Jerry) Well, you should smell it now. We fixed up the place. 

GEORGE

(gesturing with flyer) With Spartacus? 

KRAMER

(lighting his pipe) Well, it's a rare archival print. (jumps as his burns his fingers) Twelve extra minutes, full wide-screen CinemaScope, and if you come to the one o'clock show, you can hear Geoffrey Har-harwood. 

JERRY

Geoffrey who? 

KRAMER

Har-harwood, Jerry. He was the assistant wardrobe man on Spartacus. Some fascinating insights into the production. 

GEORGE

Why would I spend seven dollars to see a movie that I could watch on TV? 

KRAMER

Well, why go to a fine restaurant, when you can just stick something in the microwave? Why go to the park and fly a kite, when you can just pop a pill? (looks around Monk's) Listen, you guys haven't seen Lloyd Braun, have you? I'm supposed to meet him here. 

GEORGE

Lloyd Braun? What d'you have to meet him for? 

KRAMER

Well, he's using his connections in the Mayor's office, to uh, get the theatre landmark status. 

JERRY

I thought he screwed up the Dinkins campaign. 

KRAMER

Well, he did. You know, after that, he had a nervous breakdown? Had to spend a few months in an institution. 

GEORGE

Really? 

KRAMER

Yeah, but he's doing a lot better now. I've taken him under my wing. 

JERRY

Oh, then I'm not worried. 

KRAMER

But he still needs all of our support. Now, when he gets here treat him like he's one of the gang, huh. 

GEORGE

(thoughtful) Breakdown, huh? 

LLOYD

Hey Kramer. 

KRAMER

Oh, hey Lloyd, hey buddy. (gets up and shakes Lloyd's hand) 

LLOYD

How you doing? 

KRAMER

(slaps Lloyd on the shoulder) Sit down. (sits himself) 

LLOYD

Hi Jerry. 

JERRY

Lloyd. 

LLOYD

George. 

GEORGE

Hello, Lloyd. How you doing? 

KRAMER

Yeah well, he's doing fine, George. 

LLOYD

(offering packet) Gum? 

JERRY

(peering) That's an interesting package. 

LLOYD

Yeah, it's from China. Go ahead, try a piece. Tell me that's not the most delicious gum you've ever tasted. 

KRAMER

Yes, yes. We shall all try a piece and tell you how delicious it is. (he takes pieces for himself and Jerry) 

LLOYD

George? 

GEORGE

I don't chew gum. 

JERRY

(chewing) Mmm, different. Where'd you get it? 

LLOYD

Friend of mine in Chinatown gave it to me. If you want I can ask him where he got it. 

JERRY

Nah, don't bother. 

LLOYD

No, it's no problem. 

JERRY

I don't want it. 

KRAMER

Jerry, Jerry. Lloyd says it's no problem. He's capable of locating the gum. 

JERRY

Alright. 

KRAMER

Mmm, delicious. This is delicious. Mmm. 

GEORGE

You know what? I think this Ruthie Cohen gave me the wrong change. Didn't I pay with a twenty? I'm sure I paid with a twenty. 

ELAINE

Hey. 

GEORGE

Hey. 

JERRY

I think I finally figured out what the flavor is in this gum. It's a little lo-mein-y. (he spits it into the waste bin) 

ELAINE

What kind is that? 

JERRY

It's Chinese gum, Lloyd Braun gave me. 

ELAINE

Lloyd Braun? How's he doing? 

GEORGE

(almost gleeful) After Dinkins lost the election, he had a complete nervous breakdown. They had to lock him up. 

ELAINE

You know, that's around the same time I broke up with Lloyd. Y... you don't think that I had anything to do with his breakdown, do you? 

JERRY

You know, I remember when we parted company, I was babbling incoherently for months. 

ELAINE

Yeah? Well, I got news for you. 

GEORGE

The whole time that I was growing up, all I ever heard from my mother was 'Why can't you be more like that Lloyd Braun?' 

JERRY

And in the end Lloyd Braun became more like you. 

GEORGE

Right, gotta get going. 

JERRY

Aren't you coming with us to Spartacus? 

GEORGE

Nah, I gotta deliver some Christmas presents to my parents. 

JERRY

I thought your parents were outta town? 

GEORGE

Why d'you think I'm going now? 

POP

Georgie! 

GEORGE

Hey, Mr Lazzari. 

POP

Back in the old neighborhood, ah? 

GEORGE

Yeah, yeah. Just delivering some presents to my folks. 

POP

Oh, snazzy car. Le Baron? 

GEORGE

Yeah, eighty-three. Used to belong to John Voight. 

POP

The actor, right? 

GEORGE

Something like that. 

POP

Mind if I look under the hood? 

GEORGE

Oh, no no no no. Go ahead, Pop, you always knew your cars. 

POP

Oh, Deena! Deena, Deena, l... look who's here. 

DEENA

George Costanza, is that you? 

GEORGE

Hey Deena, come on, give us a hug. (they hug) Oh my gosh, you look as pretty as you did back in high school. 

DEENA

Boy, those were some crazy times. 

GEORGE

Yeah, yeah. Speaking of crazy, did you hear about Lloyd Braun? 

KRAMER

The Alex was built in nineteen twenty-two, during the golden era of movie palaces. Minor restorations in nineteen forty-one, forty-seven, fifty-two, fifty-eight, sixty-three, and currently to our present period of time. 

ELAINE

Boy, you're really getting into this aren't you? 

KRAMER

Yes, yes I am. The icing on the cake would be getting that landmark status from the City. We're hoping Lloyd Braun can pull a few strings. 

JERRY

Oh, can Lloyd really do that? 

KRAMER

Lloyd Braun can do anything he puts his mind to. He's fine, Jerry. (to Elaine) And you should say hello to him, Elaine. 

ELAINE

(concerned) What? Lloyd is here? 

ELAINE

What? No, no, I'd rather... 

LLOYD

Hi Elaine. 

ELAINE

(big fake smile) Lloyd, yes. Hello. 

LLOYD

Kramer tell you? We reserved some special seats, so we can all sit together. 

ELAINE

(reluctant) Oh, well... I, uh, actually Lloyd, Jerry and I have to sit in the front row, uhm, (desperately inventing) because uh, because, because he, he forgot his glasses. So uh, thanks for getting us... uhm, we'll see you afterwards. 

LLOYD

That was odd. Am I crazy, or does Jerry not wear glasses? 

KRAMER

(emphatic) You're not crazy. Jerry does wear glasses. He just forgot 'em, that's all. (puts an arm round Lloyd's shoulder) Not crazy. 

JERRY

We're all the way in the front row. Why couldn't we sit in the special seats? 

ELAINE

I'm sorry, but I didn't want Lloyd thinking I was leading him on again. Seeing him made me feel very uncomfortable. 

JERRY

Nah, you don't wanna be uncomfortable. 

DEENA

Poor Lloyd. 

GEORGE

I know. Completely bonkers! 

DEENA

Sorry I can't be so flip about this kind of thing. You know, after what happened to Pop. 

GEORGE

Pop? What happened to Pop? 

DEENA

I thought you heard. He had a nervous breakdown last year. That's why I'm taking care of him. 

POP

Oh, I tell you, they don't build 'em like this any more. 

GEORGE

(a little worried) He uh, he doesn't have the auto shop any more? 

DEENA

Uhn, it was too much for him. 

GEORGE

(very worried) Uhm, I, I gotta go. 

DEENA

What? 

GEORGE

I just remembered, I gotta be someplace. Yuh-hu-hur, that's enough. Pop. Pop, put down the wrench, Pop. 

GEORGE

Pop! POP!! 

LLOYD

's a great movie, huh? 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

LLOYD

Sorry you forgot those glasses. 

JERRY

I don't know what I was thinking. 

LLOYD

How'd you like that gum? 

JERRY

(noncommittal) Errh. 

KRAMER

(slapping Jerry on the back) Ah, he loved it. 

ELAINE

Hey Kramer, you know what? There, there isn't a light there, in the ladies' room. 

KRAMER

Yeah, yeah. It's being repaired. 

ELAINE

Oh. Oh God. 

LLOYD

You alright? 

ELAINE

Ah, I sat too close to the screen. Oh. I just gotta stretch out in a hot bath. It was nice to see you again, Lloyd. 

ELAINE

Officer. Officer, is there some reason this man has to always be using a hose? I mean, he's flooding the sidewalk. It's a waste of water. Couldn't he just use a broom? 

COP

Lady, you sold me. (strides toward florist) Hey, you with the hose. 

KRAMER

Yeah, put these glasses on. 

JERRY

(taking them) Well, what's this for? 

KRAMER

Yeah, well Lloyd, he's gonna be here any minute now. 

JERRY

So what? 

KRAMER

Well, he thinks you wear those. 

KRAMER

They're from the lost and found at the Alex. 

JERRY

Aw, c'mon Kramer, this is ridiculous. I'm not gonna put these on. 

KRAMER

Oh. Okay. So he'll just think that the two of you didn't sit with him on purpose. Ooh yeah, that's very nice. Very nice. 

GEORGE

'scuse me. I uh, I was in here this morning and uh, I believe I paid you with a twenty dollar bill, (smiles) but you only gave me change for a ten. 

CASHIER

I don't think so. 

GEORGE

Oh, I think so, and I can prove it. You see, I was doodling on the bill and uh, so if you have a twenty in there with big lips on it... well, (smiles) that's mine. Would you mind opening up the register? 

CASHIER

Not unless you buy something. 

GEORGE

Fine, I'll buy a pack of gum. 

LLOYD

Hey George. Thought you didn't chew gum? 

GEORGE

I don't. 

CASHIER

Take a look. 

GEORGE

I know I gave it to you. 

LLOYD

George, would you mind. I'm kind of in a hurry. 

GEORGE

(frustrated) Fine. Fine. (to customer) Excuse me. (heading for the door) Think I'm gonna forget about this? I haven't forgotten about this. I don't forget that easily! 

KRAMER

Hey, Jerry, look who's here. 

JERRY

Ah, Lloyd. 

LLOYD

Hi Jerry. Got some more of that gum. 

JERRY

(unenthusiastic) Oh, the gum. 

KRAMER

Yeah, let's all enjoy a chew, huh? 

JERRY

(still not happy) Uh, alright. (he takes a piece) 

KRAMER

Oh, boy. 

KRAMER

Now see, this is what the holidays are all about. Three buddies, sitting around, chewing gum, huh? Mmm, mmm, yeah. So uh, you know, Lloyd, he thinks he can get more of this. 

JERRY

Well, Lloyd's a very industrious fellow. I'm sure he can accomplish anything he sets his mind to. 

LLOYD

Actually, the importer's right in Chinatown. I'll introduce you to him, you can get it whenever you want. 

JERRY

's not necessary. 

KRAMER

Hey, Jerry, you know, Lloyd wants to do you a favour. 

JERRY

I know that, Kramer. 

LLOYD

Well, if you don't want to... 

KRAMER

No, sure sure, he wants to. It's very kind of you. Yeah, Jerry, he appreciates it. Don't you, Jerry? 

JERRY

Yes I do, Kramer. 

LLOYD

So... 

KRAMER

Yeah? 

LLOYD

How about that Elaine today, huh? 

KRAMER

Oh, baby, what was that all about, huh? 

LLOYD

(to Jerry) She was practically undressing in front of me at the theatre. 

JERRY

I didn't see anything. 

KRAMER

Yeah, you uh, really missed a show, buddy. Wooh, ba-boom, ba-boom-ba-ba-ba-boom-ba. 

DEENA

You're probably wondering why I wanted to see you again. 

GEORGE

Well, you know. (grins, snorts) It's understandable. 

DEENA

I'm glad you feel that way. Because since my father's breakdown I uh, become very sensitive to the warning signs. 

GEORGE

Warning signs? 

DEENA

Nervousness, irritability, paranoia. 

GEORGE

(disbelief) What? (laugh) Wh... what're you talking about? I'm not the one with the problem. (defensive) Lloyd Braun was in the nuthouse, not me. 

DEENA

Yet again, taking pleasure in the misfortunes of others. 

GEORGE

All my friends do that. 

DEENA

George, I'm only trying to help... 

DEENA

I'm... I'm concerned. George? George, are you listening to me? 

GEORGE

You see that woman on the horse? (points) 

GEORGE

She stole twenty dollars from me. (getting angry) Yeah, I might've gotten it back, but Lloyd Braun interfered! 

DEENA

So again it all comes back to Lloyd. 

GEORGE

(rising to his feet) Hey! Hey, you! (setting off after her) Come back here!! Don't gallop away!! 

JERRY

So you say she was on a horse? 

GEORGE

I'm telling you, that cashier is riding horses on my money. 

JERRY

Well, here's what I propose. Go down to the stables, snoop around. See if any high-flying cashier's been throwing twenty dollar bills around with big lips. 

ELAINE

Hey. 

JERRY

Well, if it isn't Chesty La Rue. 

ELAINE

(sits beside Jerry) What? 

JERRY

I was chewing gum with Lloyd Braun, and he was bragging about the peepshow you gave him at the Alex. 

ELAINE

(laughing it away) Oh God. I lost a button, so my blouse was wide open. I musta left it at the theatre. 

JERRY

Maybe it's in the lost and found. 

ELAINE

Yeah, I know. I have to go check it out. It's a beautiful button too, you know. It's antique ivory. It was my mother's. 

JERRY

You know, the way you were wolfing down that popcorn, maybe you ate it. 

KRAMER

Mr Har-harwood. Well, what an unexpected surprise to have you back at the Alex Theatre. 

HAARWOOD

Well I, I'm in a bit of a quandary. I've misplaced my spectacles. 

KRAMER

Well, let's look in lost and found, shall we? 

HAARWOOD

They're half-glasses. 

KRAMER

Brown? 

HAARWOOD

Mmm, yes, yes. 

KRAMER

Uh, yeah. Ah, well if they're not in the box, I'm sure they'll turn up soon. Listen, could you keep an eye on the place? I wanna go out and get some paraffin wax, and bring out the lustre of this vintage countertop. 

HAARWOOD

Certainly. 

HAARWOOD

Oh my goodness. What a spanking button. 

GEORGE

(glances in mirror) Alright. Alright. 

GEORGE

(getting annoyed) Hang on, it's warming up! 

GEORGE

(angrily) Oh you mother... 

GEORGE

Hey! What is your problem? 

GEORGE

Oh, hello, it's you! (angry) Listen lady, I got six minutes left on that meter, and I'm not budging til you admit you stole my twenty dollars. (smug) Huh-hu-hur, you're not so tough when you're not on your horse, are you Ruthie? 

CASHIER

Your car's on fire. 

GEORGE

Aah! Fire! 

CASHIER

(after George) Merry Christmas! 

GEORGE

(shouting) Fire!! 

GEORGE

Your hose! Where's your hose?! 

FLORIST

Cop made me disconnect it. 

KRAMER

Jeez! What happened to your car, buddy? 

GEORGE

The Jon Voight car is no more. 

KRAMER

Wow. Well, don't you sweat it. You can use my car any time you want to. 

GEORGE

No kidding? 

KRAMER

No kidding. 

GEORGE

Hey, thanks. I owe you a big one. 

KRAMER

Yeah, merry Christmas. 

GEORGE

(staring at the wreck) Whatever. 

JERRY

Alright, I'm here. Where's Braun? 

KRAMER

What, he's not here yet? 

JERRY

Look, I'll go downtown to Chinatown with him, but that is it! 

KRAMER

Listen, I'm gonna need those glasses. 

JERRY

Why? 

KRAMER

They're Geoffrey Haarwood's. 

KRAMER

(proffering) Here, try this pair. 

JERRY

Aw, these are really strong glasses. 

LLOYD

Hey gum-buddy. Nice frames. You ready to go? 

JERRY

(lacking enthusiasm) Yeah, yeah. 

KRAMER

(clapping Jerry on the back) Oh yeah, he's all ready to go. 

LLOYD

Anybody see Elaine today? 

KRAMER

Oh yeah, she called a little earlier. She's coming over to check out lost and found. 

LLOYD

Maybe I'll stick around and see what she's wearing today. Or not wearing, if you know what I mean. 

JERRY

Absolutely. Let's just stick around. 

LLOYD

Ah, tell you what, they're expecting us though. Lemme just grab a hotdog here. 

KRAMER

Uh, yeah. 

LLOYD

I'd like a hotdog, please. 

ATTENDANT

Are you outta your mind? 

KRAMER

Wh...wh...wh... what's the problem here? 

ATTENDANT

This hotdog's been here since the silent era. You'd have to be insane to eat it. 

KRAMER

No, no, no, no, no. This man is not insane. Now there's nothing wrong with it or you. 

LLOYD

Kramer, maybe... 

KRAMER

No, no, no, no. I'll show you. (slams a bill down on the counter) One hotdog please. 

ATTENDANT

(on your head be it) Okay. 

KRAMER

Mmm, doesn't that smell good, huh? 

KRAMER

Yeah, here we go, yeah. (he takes a big bite) Mmm, oh. That's delicious. Mmm. It's a perfectly sane food to eat. (he takes another bite) 

KRAMER

Uhm, interesting texture. It's chewy. (he half-coughs, half-retches) I gotta get, some air. 

ELAINE

Excuse me. 'scuse me, weren't you told to stop using that hose? 

FLORIST

How would you happen to know that? 

ELAINE

Well, uhm... I... 

FLORIST

(accusing) You're that lady that was talking to the cops, aren't you? 

ELAINE

Uh... I... 

VOICE

Hey, Joe! 

ELAINE

No, wait! You're soaking me, you're soaking me! 

ELAINE

Hey. Hey everybody. 

LLOYD

Whoah, Elaine! Once again, you've managed to top yourself. C'mon Jerry, let's go. Car's out front. 

JERRY

Lloyd? 

JERRY

Lloyd? 

ELAINE

(exasperated) What is Lloyd's problem? 

KRAMER

Look, honey, I know you're trying to get Lloyd to notice you, but this is too much. Parading around in a wet T-shirt. 

ELAINE

Uhh, I got sprayed with a hose. 

KRAMER

Yeah, well, I'm sorry, but the Alex is a family theatre, not one of your swing joints. 

DEENA

So, you want my father to pay for this? 

GEORGE

You saw him. He was fiddling with the engine. God knows what he did there. 

DEENA

And I suppose Lloyd Braun had something to do with it too. 

GEORGE

No, not Lloyd Braun. But the cashier. 

DEENA

What cashier? 

GEORGE

You remember the woman on the horse? She wanted my spot. 

DEENA

To park her horse? 

GEORGE

No, she wasn't on the horse. 

DEENA

So, your car caught fire because of my father and the woman on the horse? 

GEORGE

That's right. 

GEORGE

(points) And him! 

DEENA

The man with the flowers? 

GEORGE

Yeah, yeah, the flower guy. Listen, I know this all sounds a little crazy, but... 

GEORGE

I can't believe it. Look, that's Jerry Seinfeld. 

DEENA

Who? 

GEORGE

Jerry Seinfeld. My best friend. He can explain all of this. (calls to Jerry) Jerry. 

GEORGE

Jerry! Over here Jerry. It's me! 

GEORGE

Jerry, where y'going? It's... what're... 

DEENA

(doubtful) That was your best friend? 

GEORGE

Yeah, yeah, but he doesn't wear glasses. 

DEENA

That man was wearing glasses. 

GEORGE

I know. Don't you see. (emphatic) He was doing it to fool Lloyd Braun! 

LLOYD

I'll run in and get the gum. 

JERRY

Alright. 

LLOYD

Got any money? 

JERRY

(handing it over) Here. 

LLOYD

(climbing out of the car) I'll be back. 

GEORGE

Look, Deena, I know you think I'm crazy, but I'm not. This is just a series of bad coincidences. 

DEENA

I don't know, George. I don't know what to believe. 

GEORGE

Believe me, I am not crazy. 

DEENA

Well, I guess it's possible. 

LLOYD

Here y'go. 

JERRY

(indistinct) Got all this? 

LLOYD

Yeah. A hundred dollar's worth. 

JERRY

(incredulous) I gave you a hundred dollars?! 

LLOYD

You sure did. Am I crazy, or is that a lotta gum? 

JERRY

It's a lotta gum! 

KRAMER

Mr Hararwood. Found your glasses. 

HAARWOOD

Oh, splendid. Welcome to the Institute for the Preservation of Motion Picture Costumes and Wardrobe. 

KRAMER

Ah, the I.P.M.P.C.W. 

HAARWOOD

Well eh, we prefer to call it the Institute. 

KRAMER

Is that from Henry the Eighth? 

HAARWOOD

Yes, yes, it is. 

KRAMER

Well, you know, we're screening that tonight at the Alex. Do you think that I could wear that to promote the theatre? 

HAARWOOD

Well, I... I'd love to lend it to you, but I doubt if it would fit a man of your impressive, Raymond Massey-like, physique. The only person who could really fit into this costume, would have to be a short, stocky, man of somewhat generous proportions. 

KRAMER

(an idea occurs) You don't say. 

KRAMER

You're really helping me out with this, buddy. Kids are gonna be so thrilled. 

GEORGE

Yeah, yeah. You really cashed in on that favor pretty quick. 

KRAMER

Remember, you're a king, you must project a Royal bearing. 

GEORGE

(angry undertone) Oh, I'm gonna give you a Royal bearing. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Lemme get a pack of gum here. 

GEORGE

(handing over a bill) Can I get a pack of gum, please? 

GUY

I beg your pardon, your majesty, but we don't accept bills with lipstick on the president. 

GEORGE

What? Huh, so I had it all along. How d'you like that? (snorts) I guess I owe that cashier an apology. 

DEENA

Oh my God! 

GEORGE

No, no. Deena, it's not what you think. 

GEORGE

Th... this isn't mine. 

GEORGE

I got it from the Institute. The Institute. 

GEORGE

(shouting) Dee... Deena! 

KRAMER

Ahh, Mr Haarwood. Well, you certainly know how to dress for a premiere. 

HAARWOOD

Well, thank you. Uh, where is your friend King Henry? 

KRAMER

Oh, he ran away. 

LLOYD

Hey Kramer. 

KRAMER

I need to talk to you. 

ELAINE

You know, that button looks very familiar. 

HAARWOOD

Yes, it, it, it's antique ivory. 

ELAINE

I, I think that's my button. (wanders over to Haarwood) You know, I've been looking all over for it. Did, did you find it here? 

HAARWOOD

Yes, it was in the lost and found. 

ELAINE

Shall I undo it? 

HAARWOOD

Oh yes, of course you can. 

ELAINE

Oh, thank you. 

HAARWOOD

I'm a little ticklish. 

ELAINE

Oh. (giggly) Tickle, tickle. 

LLOYD

We've really gotta get that Elaine a boyfriend. 

KRAMER

Oh, tell me about it. 

ELAINE

(thinking) I can't believe I'm going out with this guy. Wow! He's so cool. Maybe he'll write a song about me. That would be amazing. Oh, Elaine, you are so beautiful. So, so beautiful. Not so mention your personality which is so, so, interesting. If you want, you can quit your job and never work again. 

ELAINE

Jerry, you have got to come see him. He is so terrific. 

JERRY

Maybe he'll write a song about you. 

ELAINE

Yeah. Right. (laughing) Like that really matters. 

JERRY

So I take it he's spongeworthy? 

ELAINE

Oh, yeah. 

JERRY

Well, he's a musician. I guess they're supposed to be very, you know, uninhibited and free. 

ELAINE

Well, actually, he's - he's not that way at all. 

JERRY

Oh, no? 

ELAINE

Yeah. In fact, he....(moaning) 

JERRY

Come on. Come on. 

ELAINE

I don't wanna! 

JERRY

Elaine, you're among friends. 

ELAINE

(sighs) Well, actually, he, um, doesn't really like to do... everything. 

JERRY

Oh. 

ELAINE

Yeah. It's surprising. 

JERRY

Yes, it is. It is surprising. Does that bother you? 

ELAINE

No. No, it doesn't bother me. I mean, it would be nice. I'm not gonna lie to you and say it wouldn't be nice. 

JERRY

Sure. Why not? You're there. 

ELAINE

Exactly. 

JERRY

But you said he was just coming out of a very serious relationship. Maybe he's, you know, still....kind of...he...not gonna happen. 

KRAMER

Hey, Jerry! Listen, I need you to come downstairs, help me get my stuff outta the car. 

JERRY

What stuff? 

KRAMER

I just came from the price club. I'm loaded up, baby. 

JERRY

All right. What are you, outta your mind? Look at this. What did you buy here? You will never be able to finish all this stuff. 

KRAMER

Course I will. These are staples. 

JERRY

A four-pound can of black olives? That's a staple? 

KRAMER

Lindsay olives, Jerry. 

JERRY

A forty-eight pack of Eggo waffles? A gallon of barbecue sauce? Ten pounds of cocktail meatballs? 

KRAMER

$17.50. You can't beat that. 

JERRY

Look...look at this can of tuna! 

KRAMER

Yeah. Star Kist, Jerry. Most tuna don't make their cut. 

JERRY

This isn't for a person. This is for Biosphere 3. 

KRAMER

Hey, Clyde! 

CLYDE

Hey, Kramer! What's happening, dude? 

KRAMER

Yeah. Ahh. Hey, this is Jerry here. 

CLYDE

How ya doin'? 

JERRY

Hi. 

KRAMER

You know, Clyde, he plays backup with John Germaine. 

JERRY

John Germaine? That is amazing. I was just talking about him upstairs with Elaine. 

CLYDE

Oh yeah? 

JERRY

Oh, yeah. My friend Elaine and him are goin' out. They're pretty hot and heavy. 

CLYDE

Is that right? 

KRAMER

Hey, how 'bout giving me a hand? You know, bring some of this stuff upstairs. 

CLYDE

Oh, sorry Kramer, I got to watch the hands. My hands are my life. 

ESTELLE

Georgie, can you zip me up? 

GEORGE

Yeah. Yeah, one second. 

ESTELLE

Well, come on! 

GEORGE

All right. All right. Let's not get into panic mode! Let's not make a big deal outta this thing or we're never gonna get through this night. 

ESTELLE

Well, I'm meeting your in-laws, I think I should look nice. 

GEORGE

My in-laws. Oh, my.... 

FRANK

So, what do you think? Your old man can look pretty good when he wants to, huh? 

ESTELLE

I don't like that tie. 

FRANK

What's the matter with this tie? I've hardly worn it. 

ESTELLE

It's too thin. They're wearing wide now. 

FRANK

How do you know what kind of ties they wear? 

ESTELLE

Go to any office building on 7th Avenue and tell me if there's anyone there wearing a thin tie like that. Go ahead! 

FRANK

Oh, get the hell outta here. 7th Avenue. 

ESTELLE

George, do you think he should wear a tie like that? 

FRANK

Huh? 

GEORGE

I think he should wear whatever tie he wants. 

FRANK

We gotta stop off and pick up a marble rye from Schnitzer's. 

ESTELLE

It's out of our way. Why can't we pick up something at Lord's? It's right over here. 

FRANK

No! We have to go to Schnitzer's! I'll show these people something about taste! 

GEORGE

This is gonna be fun. 

JERRY

Hey, you'll never guess who I bumped into. This guy Clyde. He's in your friend John Germaine's band there. 

ELAINE

So what did he have to say? 

JERRY

Nothing. I told him you two were pretty hot and heavy. 

ELAINE

Hot and heavy? You said hot and heavy? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

ELAINE

What did you do that for? 

JERRY

What? 

ELAINE

What if he tells John? Then John's gonna think that I think that we're hot and heavy. I don't want John thinking that I'm hot and heavy if he's not hot and heavy. 

JERRY

Oh 

ELAINE

I'm trying to get a little squirrel to come over to me here. I don't wanna make any big, sudden movements. I'll frighten him away. 

JERRY

Well, Clyde might not tell him. 

ELAINE

How do you know that? 

JERRY

I should have helped Kramer with those packages. 

ELAINE

Ohh! 

DENNIS

Let me give you a hand. Hey, Kramer. I wonder, could you do me a favor? I'm taking the family to Disneyworld next week. I wonder... 

KRAMER

Uh-huh. 

DENNIS

I wonder, could you pick up my mail? 

KRAMER

Yeah. Sure. Sure. 

DENNIS

In fact, you know what, how would you like to take my hansom cab for the week? 

KRAMER

Drive the horse? 

DENNIS

It'll just be sitting there. You can really clean up. 500 bucks a day. I'll split it with ya. 

KRAMER

Oh, giddyup. Yeah. 

GEORGE

This is delicious, Mrs. Ross. 

ROSS

Oh. 

ROSS

What are you complimenting her for? She didn't make it Rowenna did. 

FRANK

What is this thing anyway? 

ROSS

It's Cornish gamehen. 

FRANK

What is that, like a little chicken? 

GEORGE

It's, uh, it's not a little chicken. (laughing) Little chicken. It's a gamebird. 

FRANK

Gamebird? 

GEORGE

Yeah. 

FRANK

What do you mean? Like, you - you hunt it? 

ROSS

Yes. 

FRANK

How hard could it be to kill this thing? 

ESTELLE

I couldn't help but notice that you have quite a library in there. 

ROSS

If I had a dime for every book he's actually read, (laughing) I'd be broke. 

SUSAN

More wine anyone? 

FRANK

Yeah. I'll take some. 

SUSAN

Hmmm? 

FRANK

Thank you. 

SUSAN

How do you like the Merlot? 

ESTELLE

Merlot? I never heard of it. Did they just invent it? 

ROSS

Oh, mother. 

GEORGE

She's, uh, she's heard of Merlot. 

FRANK

Let me understand, you got the hen, the chicken and the rooster. The rooster goes with the chicken. So, who's having sex with the hen? 

GEORGE

Why don't we talk about it another time. 

FRANK

But you see my point here? You only hear of a hen, a rooster and a chicken. Something's missing! 

ROSS

Something's missing all right. 

ROSS

They're all chickens. The rooster has sex with all of them. 

FRANK

That's perverse. 

GEORGE

Did anybody see Firestorm? 

ROSS

Firestorm, that's a hell of a picture. 

GEORGE

Yeah. 

ROSS

Remember when they had the helicopter land on top of that car -- 

FRANK

Hey! Hey! Come on! Come on! I haven't seen it yet. 

ROSS

It doesn't have anything to do with the plot! 

FRANK

Still! Still! I like to go in fresh! 

GEORGE

Oh mother of God. 

KRAMER

Of course, uh, this is Central Park. Uh, this was designed in 1850 by Joe Peppitone. Um, built during the Civil War so the northern armies could practice fighting on...on grass. Oh, yeah. Giddyup. On Rusty! 

JOHN

Thank you. Now, I'd like to play something th -- well, actually, it's my latest so it's nice and fresh. It's called ' Hot And Heavy.' 

GEORGE

Thank God that's over. 

ESTELLE

The mother seems to hit the sauce pretty hard. I didn't like that. 

FRANK

And who doesn't serve cake after a meal? What kind of people? Would it kill them to put out a pound cake? Something! 

GEORGE

So, they didn't give you a piece of cake? Big deal. 

ESTELLE

It is a big deal. You're supposed to serve cake after a meal. I'm sorry. It's impolite. 

FRANK

Not impolite...it's stupid, that's what it is. You gotta be stupid to do something like that! 

ESTELLE

Your father's absolutely right. We're sitting there like idiots drinking coffee without a piece of cake! 

GEORGE

What is this? The marble rye? 

ROSS

Oh, dear. I forgot to put out that - that bread they brought. 

ESTELLE

We forgot to bring it in. 

FRANK

No, I brought it in. They never put it out. 

ROSS

Where is it? 

SUSAN

I don't know. Where'd you put it? 

ROSS

Right over there. 

SUSAN

Well, it's gone. 

GEORGE

You stole the bread? 

FRANK

What do you mean stole? It's my bread. They didn't eat it. Why should I leave it there? 

GEORGE

Because we brought it for them! 

FRANK

Apparently, it wasn't good enough for them to serve. 

ROSS

Is it possible they took it back? 

SUSAN

Who would bring a bread and take it back? 

ROSS

Those people, that's who. I think they're sick. 

ESTELLE

People take buses to get that rye. 

GEORGE

Maybe they forgot to put it out! 

FRANK

Aw, they didn't forget to put it out! It's deliberate! Deliberate, I tell ya! 

JERRY

He stole back the rye? 

GEORGE

Yeah. 

JERRY

Why? 

GEORGE

Why? Why? 'Cause he's off his rocker! That's why. 

JERRY

So, do the Ross's know? 

GEORGE

I don't know. They're all very suspicious. 

JERRY

Why wouldn't they be? A rye bread doesn't just disappear. 

GEORGE

Now, because of that stupid rye bread, I gotta keep them all separated for the rest of my life. 

JERRY

Bad situation. 

GEORGE

I'll tell you what I'd like to do. I'd like to replace that rye. 

JERRY

What do you mean replace it? 

GEORGE

You know, you go out, you get another rye. Of course, it would have to be the same one from Schnitzer's. You put it in the kitchen somewhere and you say Ohh! There it is. 

JERRY

Well, there ya go. What's so hard about that? 

GEORGE

What's so hard about that? How am I supposed to get it in there? I can't just walk in with it. I have to get the Rosses out of the apartment! 

JERRY

All right. All right. Don't panic. Let's just think about it. Get the Ross's out of the apartment. That can't be so hard. Wait a minute. Wait a second. Wait a second! You know, Kramer's been driving that hansom cab. 

GEORGE

So? 

JERRY

Well, Kramer'll take them around for a while. 

GEORGE

And it's their anniversary Friday night. I could send them for a hansom cab ride. Y -- you think they'd like that? 

JERRY

Are you kidding? People love it. There's something about the clip clop, clip clop. They're nuts for it. 

GEORGE

So, they go off for the ride, by the time they come back the bread is there. 

JERRY

What about Susan? 

GEORGE

She's working late that night. We're - were supposed to have dinner with everybody at eight o'clock so I'll set up the ride for seven o'clock. 

JERRY

Beautiful! 

GEORGE

You think Kramer'll do it? 

KRAMER

Of course I'll do it. I'd be happy to. So, all I gotta do is be there at seven? 

GEORGE

Yeah. Just take 'em out and ride 'em around for about..half an hour. 

KRAMER

Hey. 

JERRY

What the hell are you doing there? 

KRAMER

It's Beef-A-Reeno..and I got fifty cans. You want some? 

JERRY

No. No thanks. 

KRAMER

Jerry, I think I bought too much at that price club. I don't have any room for it all. 

GEORGE

Hold on. Hold on. Wait a minute. How am I gonna get the rye bread into the apartment? 

JERRY

Just put it under your shirt. 

GEORGE

Have you ever seen a Schnitzer's rye? It - it's huge! 

JERRY

I'll tell ya what, I'll bring it over. I'll stop by Schnitzer's, I'll come by five after seven right after they leave. 

GEORGE

Oh, this is all locking in now. It is all locking in! (laughing) 

ELAINE

Hey. Is that your horse outside? 

KRAMER

Yeah. That's Rusty. 

GEORGE

What? He's outside? 

KRAMER

Uh-huh. 

GEORGE

Aw, come on. I wanna go see him. 

KRAMER

You wanna go see him? 

GEORGE

Yeah. Hey! Hey! 

KRAMER

I'll show ya Rusty. 

GEORGE

Hey, Lainey, wanna see the horsey? 

ELAINE

Well, you really did me in this time, didn't ya? First guy I like in a really long time. I mean, we're getting along, everything is just great. I mean, all right, so he doesn't do... everything, and then you have to come along with your hot and your heavy. 

JERRY

So, you think Clyde told him? 

ELAINE

He wrote a song about it! 

JERRY

Well, maybe it's a good thing. 

ELAINE

No! It's not a good thing! It's a bad thing! Do you know what this is like? To have no control over a relationship? And - and you feel sick to your stomach all the time? Do you know what that's like? 

JERRY

No, but I've read articles and I must say it, doesn't sound very pleasant. 

ELAINE

You know, one of these days, something terrible is gonna happen to you. It has to! 

JERRY

No. I'm gonna be just fine, but as far as your situation, you're seeing him tonight so talk to him about it. 

ELAINE

I can't! He's got a big showcase for record producers at his late show tonight. I don't wanna upset him. Aw, what the hell, I'll upset him. 

ROSS

Yeah George, I gotta tell ya, this is a very nice gesture. We really appreciate it. 

GEORGE

Aw, well, you know, it's your anniversary. It's - it's the least I can do. I - I just want you guys to go out and have a good time. Ha ha. So, you think we should, uh, we should get downstairs? 

ROSS

Oh, we got about twenty minutes. You, uh, seem a little nervous George. Anything wrong? 

GEORGE

Oh, no. No. No. No. No. Nothing. I'm fine. Everything's fine. Fine. Just get a little nervous on the weekends, that's all. Could I, uh, could I get a glass of water? 

ROSS

We've got water. I don't think we have any bread, but we've got water. 

KRAMER

Yeah. There ya go. That's Beef-A-Reeno. (singing) I'm so keen-o On Beef-A-Reeno What a delicious cuisine-o Fit for a king and queen-o! Yeah. Eat up. I got thirty four more cans. 

ROSS

Nice night for a hansom cab ride, 'ay George? 

ROSS

You know, George we haven't done anything romantic like this in ....years. 

GEORGE

(thinking) Oh my God, it's 7:01. What have I done? My whole plan is depending on Kramer? Have I learned nothing? How could I make such a stupid mistake? He'll never show up! 

KRAMER

Ah ha! 

GEORGE

There he is. Right on time as usual. 

WOMAN

53. 

MABEL

53. I'd like a marble rye, no plastic, in a bag. 

WOMAN

Ah! You're lucky. It's our last one. 

JERRY

Wait a second, that's your last marble rye? 

WOMAN

That's right. 

JERRY

There's none left? 

WOMAN

That's what I said. Number 54. 

JERRY

Uh, excuse me. I know this is gonna sound crazy but I - I have to have that rye. It's a - it's a long story, but a person's whole future may depend on it. 

MABEL

Well, I'm sorry, but you should have got here earlier. 

JERRY

Yes. Well, be that as it may, if you could just find it in yourself to give it up. 

MABEL

You're not getting this rye -- 

JERRY

All right. All right. I'll tell ya what I'm gonna do, I will give you double what you paid for it. 

MABEL

You're in my way! 

KRAMER

Ahh! Mr. Ross. Mrs. Ross. My name is Cosmo and I'll be your driver for this evening. We have blankets for your comfort. I also have hot chocolate if the mood should strike you. 

ROSS

My favorite. 

KRAMER

Well, if we're all set to go, why don't you two hop aboard and let me show you a little taste of old New York...the way it once was. Oh, happy anniversary. On, Rusty! 

JERRY

All right. Look, I'll tell ya what, I'll give you $50. Now, be reasonable you cannot turn down $50 for a $6 rye. 

MABEL

No? Watch me. 

JERRY

Give me that rye! 

MABEL

Stop it! 

JERRY

I want that rye, lady! 

MABEL

Help! Someone help! 

JERRY

Shut up, you old bag! 

MABEL

Stop thief! Stop him! He's got my marble rye! 

ELAINE

I'm sorry to just show up unexpectedly like this. I know you've got your big showcase coming up later and I know how important it is, I know how hard you work for this night, but I just had to tell you that I never told Jerry hot and heavy. I didn't think we were hot and heavy. I mean - I mean, who's hot and who's heavy? 

JOHN

Whoa. Hold on, Elaine I.....I'm kinda disappointed. 

ELAINE

Disappointed? 

JOHN

Yeah. I mean, I was excited when Clyde told me that. 

ELAINE

You were? 

JOHN

Absolutely. 

ELAINE

Ohh! Whew! I am so relieved! 

JOHN

Listen, uh, I've still got a couple of hours to kill before the next show. My place is only a few blocks from here. 

ELAINE

Really? 

JOHN

And you know what? 

ELAINE

What? 

JOHN

I've been thinking about what we do and I'm thinking..of...adding a new number to my, you know, repertoire. 

ELAINE

Ohh! 

KRAMER

Y'aah! 

ROSS

(sniffing) What is that? 

ROSS

I think it's the horse. 

ROSS

Oh, God. 

KRAMER

Hey, how's everything? You..you need anything? 

ROSS

This is - this is...horrible. 

ROSS

Excuse me,...what do you feed this animal? 

KRAMER

Oh, you know, oats and hay. You know, they like that stuff. 

ROSS

I can't take this. Let me out of this thing! 

ROSS

Turn this thing around. We've had it. We can't breathe back here! And hurry it up! 

KRAMER

Rusty! Rusty! 

GEORGE

(whistling) 

KRAMER

Whoa! 

GEORGE

Wha - what happened? What are you doing back so soon? 

ROSS

Ask Rusty. 

KRAMER

I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Ross. One never knows how the gastrointestinal workings of the equine are going to function. 

ROSS

Thanks for nothing! Come on, George. Let's go upstairs. 

GEORGE

What the hell happened? 

KRAMER

The horse is gassy. Must have been the Beef-A-Reeno. 

GEORGE

Beef-A-Reeno? You fed the horse Beef-A-Reeno?! 

KRAMER

Well, I overbought! 

ROSS

George. 

GEORGE

(muttering) 

GUY

What's going on? Where is he? 

MANAGER

Uh...he'll be here soon. 

GUY

I'll give him ten more minutes. I'm not gonna stay here all night. 

JERRY

How much did you give him? 

KRAMER

Just a can. But he really liked it, though. 

GEORGE

Jerry! Up here! 

JERRY

Yeah. Hey, what do you want me to do with this? 

GEORGE

I can't come out. They're standing right by the door. Throw it up! 

JERRY

Really? 

GEORGE

Yeah. Yeah. It's the only way. Come on. What are you, kidding me? 

JERRY

Will you get this horse outta here. He's killing me. I can't get any oxygen. 

KRAMER

I don't wanna go back on there! 

GEORGE

Come on! 

JERRY

(grunting as he throws bread into the air) 

GEORGE

(grunting) Hey! Hey, wait a second. I got an idea. 

ELAINE

No. No. Don't be silly, John, you were very good. You just don't have to try so hard. Good luck, honey. 

GEORGE

Come on! Come on! 

JERRY

Wait a second! I never baited a hook with a rye before. Your hook is too small. This is for, like, a muffin. All right. Take it away. 

GEORGE

Come on. Come on. Come on. Yeah. Yeah. (grunting) 

MANAGER

Ladies and gentlemen, John Germaine. 

JERRY

How did you lock your keys in the car? 

GEORGE

How? Cause I'm an Idiot. 

GEORGE

I was going to, but then I found out that the auto club has this free locksmith service, so I signed up. &nbsp;Just waiting for the membership to kick in. 

JERRY

How long has your car been sitting in the Yankee parking lot? 

GEORGE

I don't know, about three days. 

KRAMER

Hello boys. 

KRAMER

Yes, indeed. &nbsp;The calendar says winter, but he gods of spring are out. 

GEORGE

Are the courses open? 

GEORGE

Huh, No kidding? 

JERRY

Really, you're getting that good? 

KRAMER

Oh, I'm the real deal. 

KRAMER

Yeah, here, Stan, in here! 

KRAMER

There he is, yeah - Jerry, George, *this* is Stan the Caddy. 

GEORGE

How ya doin'? 

STAN

Nice to meet you. &nbsp;Ready to hit the links, Kramer? 

STAN

What are those, ah, cotton pants? 

KRAMER

Yeah, Yeah...Why, is it too cold out? 

STAN

Here's what you do: you bring a lightweight jacket, that way the sun comes out, you play the jacket off the sweater. 

GEORGE

Yeah. 

JERRY

(together -- with arms extended -- palms upwards) &nbsp;Stan The Caddy. 

ELAINE

&nbsp;Oh, great. &nbsp;It's the bra-less wonder. Who does she think she's kidding? &nbsp;Look at her, she's totally out of control. 

ELLEN

I was thinking that woman looks like Elaine Benes. &nbsp; 

ELAINE

Yeah, ha ha ha. &nbsp;What have you been up to? 

ELLEN

I've just been hanging out. 

ELAINE

I see. 

ELLEN

Hmm. Oh, listen! &nbsp;I'm having a birthday party tomorrow evening, I'd love it if you came by. 

ELLEN

Um-hm. 

ELLEN

Nooo? 

ELAINE

Yeah, I'm just really, really busy. 

ELLEN

Oh, that's too bad. 

ELAINE

Yeah, yeah. 

ELLEN

Well, I hope you can get me a gift anyway.........ha ha ha. 

ELAINE

Ah Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. 

WILHELM

George!? 

GEORGE

(he drops a paper airplane he was holding) Mr. Wilhelm! 

WILHELM

I'm sorry to interrupt you, but Mr. Steinbrenner and I really want you to know we appreciate all the hours you've been putting in... Oh, and, ah, confidentially, Sozonkel, our Assistant to the General Manger, hasn't really been working out. And the boss thinks you're the man for the job! &nbsp;So, keep it under your hat! 

GEORGE

Assistant to the General Manager!! &nbsp;Do you know what means?!? &nbsp;He'd could be askin' my advice on trades! &nbsp;Trades, Jerry, I'm a heartbeat away! 

GEORGE

And, it is all because of that car... 

GEORGE

...See, Steinbrenner is like the first guy in, at the crack of dawn. &nbsp;He sees my car, he figures I'm the first guy in... &nbsp; 

GEORGE

...Then, the last person to leave is Wilhelm. &nbsp;He sees my car, he figures I'm burning the midnight oil. &nbsp;Between the two of them, they think I'm working an 18 hour day! (he stands there with his hands on his hips, a wide grin - laughing.) 

JERRY

Locking your keys in your car is the best career move you ever made. 

ELAINE

Hey. 

JERRY

Hey. 

GEORGE

Hey, how ya doing?!? 

ELAINE

Better, now. 

JERRY

Yeah, what happened? 

ELAINE

You know Sue Ellen Mishke? 

JERRY

Sue Ellen Mishke? &nbsp; 

ELAINE

Yeah, the woman I grew up with in Maryland, she moved here last year... 

JERRY

Sounds familiar. 

ELAINE

The heiress to the O'Henry candy bar fortune-- 

ELAINE

Yes. Yes &nbsp;I ran into her today. &nbsp;This woman has never, not once, ever, as long as I have known her, worn a bra. 

GEORGE

Ah, that is disgusting-- 

JERRY

That is just shameless, I don't know, There's no-- 

GEORGE

She's a pig. The woman's a pig, what wrong with her-- 

JERRY

It's wrong, it's rude, and it's incorrect. 

GEORGE

It's disgusting-- 

ELAINE

&nbsp;Alright, there's no--- 

GEORGE

Come on! Come-on. 

JERRY

We're only kidding! 

ELAINE

You don't understand. &nbsp;See, she hasn't changed at all. &nbsp;She stole my boyfriend when I was in high school. (flashback sequence)&nbsp;I was at this party, and I was dating this *really* cute guy, his name was Tom Cosley, by the way, and she goes walking by, in this little floozy outfit, and he follows her, right out the door! 

JERRY

She's your Lex Luthor! 

ELAINE

Her birthday's comin' up, see, so I decided to get her a little present. 

JERRY

What are you going to get her? 

ELAINE

A very traditional, a very supportive, brazier. 

JERRY

What the hell are you doing here, aren't you supposed to be at work?!? 

GEORGE

Yeah, well I'm thinking about getting out of town with Susan for a few days....Her parents rebuilt the cabin! &nbsp; 

JERRY

So, you're just taking off from work? 

GEORGE

Yeah well, they won't know. &nbsp;I got the car there. 

GEORGE

My presence, in that office, can only hurt my chances. 

RECEPTIONIST

(on Intercom) &nbsp;Sue Ellen Mishke to see you. 

ELAINE

&nbsp;Sue Ellen Mishke? &nbsp;Ah, alright, send her in. 

ELLEN

I happened to be in the neighborhood, so I thought I'd stop in, and thank you for your lovely gift. 

ELLEN

Is anything wrong? 

GEORGE

This is the life! Isn't it, huh, kid? 

SUSAN

Oh, it was on the windshield of the car when we came out of that rest stop. 

JERRY

Yeah, so? 

JERRY

You know last time you had me throwin' a rye bread up three floors to you, now you want me to go up to the Bronx, take flyers off your car, where does it end?!? 

KRAMER

Oowe (Kramer noise -- he's eating something) 

KRAMER

Nothin'. 

KRAMER

yep. 

KRAMER

Wheehh 

KRAMER

Wait a second.... 

KRAMER

I'll just snag the lock with this. auhh... &nbsp;Here we go... 

KRAMER

Well, George has gotta be happy about this. 

JERRY

Yeah, yeah, yeah... 

KRAMER

&nbsp;Oh, mama. 

JERRY

I guess I have to bring his car back up to the stadium, if it can make it. 

JERRY

He was starin' at some woman! 

KRAMER

Well I couldn't help it, you saw what she was wearing. 

ELAINE

What woman? 

ELAINE

&nbsp;Oh...my God. 

KRAMER

Hey you know, my arm really hurts. &nbsp;I wonder if its gonna affect my golf swing. &nbsp; 

KRAMER

Oohh. 

STAN

Oh, no.&nbsp;Not the left arm! 

STAN

Let's go for the green! You know a good lawyer? 

KRAMER

Yeah.&nbsp;So I got distracted and I crashed the car. 

JACKIE

Susie, call Dr. Bison, set up an appointment for Mr. Kramer, tell him it's for me. 

STEINBRENNER

Find him, Wilhelm! 

JERRY

Yes, yes, I do. 

ELLEN

Do you happen to know if he'll be back anytime soon? 

ELLEN

Thanks. 

WILHELM

Right. Yessir. 

WILHELM

Yes Sir! (closes the door) 

WILHELM

(from behind the closed door in the hallway) Yes Sir! 

KRAMER

Goohhhhck. 

KRAMER

Oh I see....Yessss. Little Miss Candy Bar paid a visit, didn't she? 

KRAMER

You're just out for sex!! 

ESTELLE

Yesss? 

STEINBRENNER

My name is George Steinbrenner, I'm afraid I have some very sad new about your son. 

ESTELLE

(gasps) 

STEINBRENNER

Well, he'd been logging some pretty heavy hours, first one in in the morning, last one to leave at night. &nbsp;That kid was a human dynamo. 

FRANK

What the hell did you trade Jay Buener for?!? &nbsp;He had 30 home runs, and over 100 RBIs last year. He's got a rocket for an arm - - you don't know what the hell you're doin'!! 

MESSAGE

'I'm not here, leave a message.' 

FRANK

Jerry, it's Frank Costanza, Mr. Steinbrenner's here, George is dead, call me back! 

JERRY

Hello? 

GEORGE

Hey, it's George. &nbsp; 

JERRY

Where have you been?!? 

GEORGE

Dead? &nbsp; 

JERRY

Yeah, and we had an accident with your car, it's a, it's a little crumpled. 

GEORGE

My car's a little crumpled?!? 

JERRY

Yeah, yeah, I didn't know what to do so I put it back at the stadium. &nbsp;Oh, wait a second, wait a second, they saw the car, they saw the blood, they couldn't find ya, that's why Steinbrenner thinks you're dead! 

GEORGE

Allright, I gotta head back right away, I'll-I'll -- I gotta figure something out here. 

JERRY

Well you gotta call your parents. 

GEORGE

I can't, Steinbrenner might still be there! 

JERRY

Aren't you gonna tell your parents you're still alive? 

PETERMAN

Elaine, do you see this? &nbsp;Do you see what I'm holding in my hands? 

ELAINE

Yeah, it's a bra. 

PETERMAN

I saw a woman in our hallway wearing one of these as a top. (sits on the corner of the desk)&nbsp;What exquisite beauty, I ran down the hallway to talk to her, but the elevator door closed. It was not to be.&nbsp;Perhaps our paths will cross again some day. 

ELAINE

w-What is this all about? 

PETERMAN

I wanna market this item as a new direction in women's fashion. &nbsp; 

ELAINE

Oh-oh, but- 

PETERMAN

We're gonna sell this as a top. Here's the angle: Zelda Fitzgerald, aaaand, somebody in the 20s, wearing this at wild parties, driving all the men crazy (tosses the bra on Elaine's desk)... Have it on my desk by the end of the week. 

STEINBRENNER

Come in, come in. 

GEORGE

Yeah, it's me sir. &nbsp;It's been a harrowing few days. uuh,&nbsp;After the car accident, I-I crawled into a ditch, and managed to survive on, grubs and puddle water, until a kindly old gentleman picked me up. 

GEORGE

I didn't get the job? 

STEINBRENNER

Well, once you were dead, we couldn't just sit on our hands. &nbsp;We had to make a move... 

JACKIE

So it was the meeting on the street that prompted you to buy the bra for Miss Mishke, would you say that was correct? 

ELAINE

Yes...ummm, (leans into the microphone, pulling it closer it squeaks) yes, that's correct. 

JACKIE

And you have also brought with you, another bra, (goes over to the table and pulls a bra out of a bag) exactly like, the one that she so flagrantly exhibited herself in! 

ELAINE

Yes, that's correct. 

JACKIE

Uh, what was you golf score, the last round you played... uh, before you shoulder was injured? 

KRAMER

Three under par. 

JACKIE

Oooohhhh, three under par, Hmm...That's what the professionals shoot, isn't it? 

JACKIE

Well would you tell this jury exactly what you saw at the corner of 83rd Street and Columbus? 

JERRY

I...don't remember. 

JACKIE

Well, did you, or did you not, see the defendant, wearing the bra? 

JERRY

I don't know. &nbsp;Maybe. 

JACKIE

Mr. Seinfeld, I might remind you that you are under oath. &nbsp;Now I ask you again, did you or did you not, see this woman wearing a bra?!? 

JERRY

....Alright, alright, I saw her!... 

JERRY

And she was beautiful in that bra! &nbsp;I'm crazy about her! &nbsp;I love her whole free swinging, free wheeling attitude! 

JUDGE

This court will come to order! 

JACKIE

No further questions, your honor. 

JUDGE

You may step down. 

JACKIE

Well Kramer, I think we got this wrapped up. 

KRAMER

Yeah, yeah...What's your read, Stan? 

STAN

You're close, you're on the green. You just have to go for the cup. 

STAN

Have her try on the bra, see if it fits. 

JACKIE

No, no, no, no! &nbsp; 

KRAMER

Do it, Jackie. Stan's the man. 

JACKIE

Stan? Who the hell is Stan? &nbsp; 

JACKIE

You're caddy?!? &nbsp;This is a big mistake! &nbsp; 

KRAMER

Gu-gu- cada- 

JACKIE

Your honor, we request at this time, that Miss Mishke...try on the bra. 

JUDGE

(bangs the gavel twice)&nbsp;This court will come to order! &nbsp;Go ahead Miss Mishke, try it on. 

ELLEN

Uhhh-Ah, it doesn't fit...I, I-I can't put it on. 

JACKIE

&nbsp;Damn fools! &nbsp;Look at that! &nbsp;We got nothin' now, nothin'! I've been practicing law for 25 years, you're listenin' to a caddy! &nbsp; 

KRAMER

OK, OK- 

ELAINE

Oh, no, I-I don't think so. 

ELAINE

Yeah, yeah, thanks. 

ELAINE

Oh, I don't think you'll have any trouble gettin' a table. 

ELAINE

(awed) Oh, look at this! 

JERRY

Boy, I miss the days they made toys that could kill a kid. 

ELAINE

(excited) Oh, cool! Look at that! 

JERRY

(admiring Christie) Yeah, I'm right there with ya. 

ELAINE

(excited) That is a Schwinn Stingray! And it's the girl's model! Oh, I always wanted one of these when I was little. 

ELAINE

What d'you think Jerry? Jerry? 

JERRY

(tearing himself away from Christie) Huh? 

ELAINE

What d'you think? 

JERRY

Oh yeah, be great for your paper route. 

ELAINE

(laughs) I love it. I'm getting it. 

ELAINE

Can you help me get it down, Jer? Jerry. 

CHRISTIE

I think your friend needs some help over there. 

JERRY

You know, the only way to really help her is to just let her be. 

ELAINE

Hey! 

SUSAN

A little baby girl? 

KEN

Doctor says it could be any day now. 

GEORGE

(through mouthful of food) So, Carrie, you and Susan are cousins. So your baby daughter is gonna be Susan's second cousin, right? So what does that make me? 

CARRIE

Doesn't make you anything. 

GEORGE

(jokingly) Well, so, legally, I could marry your daughter. 

SUSAN

So, have you picked out a name yet? 

CARRIE

Well, we've narrowed it down to a few. We like Kimberley. 

SUSAN

Aww. 

GEORGE

(negative) Hu-ho, boy. 

KEN

You don't like Kimberley? 

GEORGE

Ech. What else you got? 

KEN

How about Joan? 

GEORGE

Aw c'mon, I'm eating here. 

SUSAN

(warning) George! 

CARRIE

Pamela? 

GEORGE

Pamela?! Awright, I tell you what. You look like nice people, I'm gonna help you out. You want a beautiful name? Soda. 

KEN

What? 

GEORGE

Soda. S-O-D-A. Soda. 

CARRIE

I don't know, it sounds a little strange. 

GEORGE

All names sound strange the first time you hear 'em. What, you telling me people loved the name Blanche the first time they heard it? 

KEN

Yeah, but uh... Soda? 

GEORGE

Yeah, that's right. It's working. 

CARRIE

We'll put it on the list. 

GEORGE

I solve problems. That's just what I do. 

KRAMER

(sniffing a slice of meat) Yeah, oh boy. Mmm, that's good. 

JERRY

You're really going to town with that turkey there. 

KRAMER

Oh yeah, I got a big appetite. 

KRAMER

Uhh, Jerry, you got no mustard, huh. 

JERRY

It's on the door. 

KRAMER

(examining a yellow squeeze bottle) What, this yellow stuff? No, I said mustard, Jerry. Dijon. 

KRAMER

Ah, 's no good. 

KRAMER

No. That's bush league. 

JERRY

Hey, hey. Wha... wait... what, you're gonna leave it there? That's like half a pound of turkey! 

KRAMER

No, no, I can't eat that. You can't eat a sandwich without Dijon. 

JERRY

(sarcasm) Yeah, you're right. I really should keep more of your favourites on hand. 

KRAMER

Hey, hey, hey. I'm getting a vibe here. What, are you unhappy with our arrangement? 

JERRY

What arrangement? 

KRAMER

Well, I was under the impression that I could take anything I wanted from your fridge, and you could take whatever you want from mine. 

JERRY

(sarcasm) Yeah, well, lemme know when you get something in there and I will. 

KRAMER

Oh, hey. 

ELAINE

Hey. 

JERRY

Hey. What's with your neck? 

ELAINE

Still killing me from having to get that bike off the wall. (pointedly) By myself. 

JERRY

Well, if it's any consolation, I did get her number. 

ELAINE

(sitting) Ah, I think I really strained it. Ow. 

JERRY

Aw, I doubt you strained it. Maybe you pulled it. 

ELAINE

Ach, maybe. 

JERRY

Did you twist it? You coulda twisted it. 

ELAINE

I don't know. 

JERRY

Did you wrench it? Did you jam it? Maybe you squeezed it. Turned it... 

ELAINE

(patience exhausted) You know what, why don't you just shut the hell up? 

JERRY

Awright. 

ELAINE

God. Man, this is killing me. Right now, I would give that bike to the first person who could make this pain go away. 

KRAMER

Aw, you really hurting, huh? 

ELAINE

Oh, Kramer, it's just awful. 

KRAMER

Uh hmm. Well, your arterioles have constricted. 

KRAMER

Alright, lean forward, relax. 

ELAINE

(worried) What? What? 

KRAMER

Encounter shiatsu. 

ELAINE

Wait a minute. Kramer, you know what you're doing here? 

KRAMER

(continuing to work) Ohh yeah. A wise man once taught me the Healing power of the body's natural pressure points. 

ELAINE

Ah hah. 

KRAMER

(to Jerry) He sells tee-shirts outside the World Trade Centre. 

ELAINE

(seriously worried) Wha...? 

KRAMER

He's a genius. Here we go... 

KRAMER

From pain, will come pleasure. 

KRAMER

Uh? Voila. 

ELAINE

(pleasantly surprised) Oh my god! 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

ELAINE

Wow! That is unbelievable. The pain is totally gone! 

JERRY

What's even more amazing is his formal training is in pediatrics. 

KRAMER

Awright, my work is done here. 

ELAINE

(big smile) Oh man! Kramer, thank you! 

KRAMER

(closing the door) Yeah, you can send that bike over any time. 

ELAINE

(after Kramer) What? (to Jerry) What, what is he talking about? 

JERRY

I dunno. (realising) Oh, 'cos you said you'd give the bike to anyone who fixes your neck. 

ELAINE

You really think he wants the bike? 

JERRY

Oh yeah. 

ELAINE

It took him like ten seconds! 

JERRY

Well, that's the most he's worked in the last four months. 

GEORGE

I think they really went for that Soda. 

SUSAN

What, are you crazy? They hated it. They were just humouring you. 

GEORGE

Ah, alright. Believe me, that kid's gonna be called Soda. 

SUSAN

I can tell you, I would never name my child Soda. 

GEORGE

Oh, no no no. Course not. I got a great name for our kids. A real original. You wanna hear what it is? Huh, you ready? 

SUSAN

Yeah. 

SUSAN

What is that? Sign language? 

GEORGE

No, Seven. 

SUSAN

Seven Costanza? You're serious? 

GEORGE

Yeah. It's a beautiful name for a boy or a girl... 

GEORGE

...especially a girl. Or a boy. 

SUSAN

I don't think so. 

GEORGE

What, you don't like the name? 

SUSAN

It's not a name. It's a number. 

GEORGE

I know. It's Mickey Mantle's number. So not only is it an all around beautiful name, it is also a living tribute. 

SUSAN

It's awful. I hate it! 

GEORGE

(angry) Well, that's the name! 

SUSAN

(also angry) Oh no it is not! No child of mine is ever going to be named Seven! 

GEORGE

(yelling) Awright, let's just stay calm here! Don't get all crazy on me! 

JERRY

Seven? Yeah, I guess I could see it. Seven. Seven periods of school, seven beatings a day. Roughly seven stitches a beating, and eventually seven years to life. Yeah, you're doing that child quite a service. 

GEORGE

(adamant) Yes I am. I defy you to come up with a better name than Seven. 

JERRY

Awright, let's see. How about Mug? (picks up the mug) Mug Costanza, that's original. (he turns and sees another item) Or uh, Ketchup? Pretty name for a girl. 

GEORGE

Alright, you having a good time there? 

JERRY

I got fifty right here in the cupboard. How about Bisquik? Pimento. Gherkin. Sauce. Maxwell House. 

GEORGE

(shouts) Awright already!! This is a very key issue with me, Jerry. I had this name for a long time. 

JERRY

Oh, I forgot to call Christie. 

GEORGE

Christie? That's the one you met in the antique store? 

JERRY

Yeah, she had this great black and white dress, with a scoop neck. She looked like some kinda superhero. 

GEORGE

And you met her in an antique store! I don't know how you do it! 

JERRY

(smug) I'm not engaged. 

KRAMER

Ah, I got it. 

JERRY

Got what? 

KRAMER

(putting the items on the counter) Got the answer, Jerry. Refrigerator problem, is solved. 

JERRY

Oh, it's no problem. You can take whatever you want. 

KRAMER

Oh, I will. But now, I'm accountable. Alright, I take what I want. 

KRAMER

Here. I write it down. (he writes) 'One cupcake.' And then I put it in the bowl. (he tears off the sheet, crumples it and drops it into the bowl) There. Very simple. 

JERRY

Sort of a mooching inventory. 

KRAMER

No, no. Not mooching. 'Cos at the end of the week, you add 'em all up, and you give me the bill. 

JERRY

Alright. 

KRAMER

Alright, now look I gotta run some errands, so look. When Elaine comes by with that bike, you hang onto it for me, alright? 

JERRY

Kramer, I don't know if you're getting that bike. 

KRAMER

Yes I am. We had a verbal contract. If we can't take each other at our word, all is lost. 

KRAMER

(waving at the bowl) Oh yeah, yeah. Put that on my tab. 

JERRY

Well this is it. The food is atrocious, but the busboys are the best in the city. 

CHRISTIE

Yes, thank you. 

GEORGE

The same outfit? 

JERRY

The exact same outfit. 

GEORGE

How many days was it between encounters. 

JERRY

Three. 

GEORGE

Three days. Well, maybe you caught her on the cusp of a new wash cycle. You know, she did laundry the day after she met you, everything got clean and she started all over again. 

JERRY

Possibly, but then shouldn't the outfit only reappear again at the end of the cycle? 

GEORGE

Maybe she moved it up in the rotation. 

JERRY

Why? It's our first date, she's already in reruns? 

GEORGE

Very curious. 

JERRY

Indeed. 

GEORGE

You know, Einstein wore the exact same outfit every day. 

JERRY

Well, if she splits the atom, I'll let it slide. 

GEORGE

(picking up his coat) Awright, I'm heading home. 

JERRY

Hey, did Susan change her mind about the name? 

GEORGE

(standing) Not yet, but she's weakening. 

JERRY

You know, George, just because your life is destroyed, don't destroy someone else's. 

GEORGE

It's Mickey Mantle, Jerry. My idol. 

JERRY

How about 'Mickey'? 

GEORGE

'Mickey'? (incredulous) 'Mickey'! 

KRAMER

Hey buddy. 

JERRY

(holding up a can) Hey, is this your half a can of soda in the fridge? 

KRAMER

No, that's yours. My half is gone. 

JERRY

What? 

KRAMER

Yeah, I put my half a can here on the tab. Why, what's your beef? 

JERRY

You cannot buy half a can of soda. 

KRAMER

Well, why not. 

JERRY

Well, I don't wanna get into the whole physics of carbonation with you here, but you know the sound a can makes when you open it? 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

JERRY

That is the sound of you buying a whole can. And the same goes for this, okay... 

JERRY

...When you pierce the skin of a piece of fruit, you've bought the whole fruit. Not a third of an apple, not a half of a banana... 

KRAMER

Alright. 

JERRY

...You bite it, you bought it. 

KRAMER

Alright, alright. I'll make the necessary adjustments, alright. 

JERRY

Thank you. 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

ELAINE

Hey. 

KRAMER

Oh. (pointedly) So, how's the neck? Nice and loose? 

ELAINE

Lookit, Kramer, you are not getting this bike. I don't even know why you ant it. (laughingly) I mean, it's a girl's bike. 

KRAMER

(deadly serious) It's a verbal contract. We had a deal. 

ELAINE

No we didn't. You take these things too literally. It's like saying, you're hungry enough to eat a horse. 

KRAMER

Well, my friend Jay Reimenschneider eats horse all the time. He gets it from his butcher. 

ELAINE

This is not the point. (emphatic) The point is, you just can't have the bike. 

KRAMER

Boy, I am really surprised at you. (opening the door) You are the last person I figured would do something like this. I mean, George, yeah, I can see that. Even Jerry. But not you, Elaine... 

KRAMER

I always put you up here... 

KRAMER

...They're over here. Now you're... aww-whawww. 

ELAINE

(grudging) Alright. 

KRAMER

(points) Digidi. 

GEORGE

Aw c'mon. It's a fantastic name. It's a real original, nobody else is gonna have it and I absolutely love it. 

SUSAN

Well, I dunno how original it's gonna be any more. 

GEORGE

Why not? 

SUSAN

Well I was telling Carrie about our argument, and when I told them the name, they just loved it. 

GEORGE

So, what're you saying? 

SUSAN

They're gonna name their baby Seven. 

GEORGE

(disbelief) What?! They're stealing the name?! That's my name, I made it up! 

SUSAN

I can't believe that they're using it. 

GEORGE

(anger) Well now it's not gonna be original! It's gonna lose all its cachet! 

SUSAN

I dunno how much cachet it had to begin with. 

GEORGE

(rage) Oh, it's got cachet, baby! It's got cachet up the yin-yang! 

ELAINE

(in pain) Oh god! Oh, god. (bitter) Kramer! 

MAN

Watch your step. 

ELAINE

(pain) Oh, ah. (bitter) Stupid Kramer. 

CHRISTIE

Excuse me. Elaine? 

ELAINE

Huh? 

CHRISTIE

Over here. I thought that was you. You're Jerry's friend, right? 

ELAINE

Yeah, yeah. Uh, Christie? 

CHRISTIE

Yes. How y'doing? 

ELAINE

(bearing up) I'm fine. 

CHRISTIE

Well, I gotta run. It was good to see you. 

ELAINE

(after Christie) Okay, oh, it was good to, good to see you. 

KRAMER

You got that right! 

KID

(scorn) Hey, you're riding a girl's bike. 

ELAINE

(shouting) Kramer! Kramer! 

KEN

Hello. 

GEORGE

Hello, Ken. It's George Costanza. I think we need to talk. 

ELAINE

(angry shout) Kramer! 

ELAINE

Kramer!! 

JERRY

Hey 

ELAINE

Ow! God! Is Kramer back from his little joyride yet? 

JERRY

Haven't seen him. How's the neck? 

ELAINE

His chiropractic job was a crock. It's even worse than it was before. 

JERRY

Boy, I'm surprised. (sarcasm) I would think Kramer would have a knack for moving pieces of a person's spine around. 

ELAINE

Hey, you know what, I think I ran into that girl from the antique store. What's her name, Christie? 

JERRY

You saw her? What was she wearing? 

ELAINE

I don't know. I couldn't see. I couldn't look down because of my neck. 

JERRY

Didn't you get a glimpse? An impression? 

ELAINE

What d'you care? 

JERRY

Both times I've seen her she's worn the same dress. 

ELAINE

Did you have a nice ride? 

KRAMER

Oh, great ride. 

ELAINE

Oh, that's good. 'Cos it was your last! 

KRAMER

What're you talking about?! We had a deal! 

ELAINE

(anger) You better give me back that bike! (indicating neck) Look at this! Look! Ow. I couldn't even crawl out of bed this morning. 

KRAMER

Bed? You should be sleeping on a wooden board for at least a week. 

ELAINE

What? You never told me that. 

KRAMER

Well, it's common sense. 

ELAINE

Jerry, what is he talking about? He's being ridiculous. 

KRAMER

Alright, look. Jerry, you know the whole story, you should settle this. 

ELAINE

Yeah Jerry. 

JERRY

Well, I'm flattered that you would both appeal to my wisdom, but unfortunately, my friendship to each of you precludes my getting involved. What you need is an impartial mediator. 

ELAINE

Yeah, I'd go for that. Would you go for that? 

KRAMER

Alright, I'm down. 

JERRY

Course, it would have to be someone who hasn't heard the story before. Someone who is unencumbered by any emotional attachment. Someone whose heart is so dark, it cannot be swayed by pity, compassion, or human emotion of any kind. 

ELAINE

So, that's the situation. 

NEWMAN

Mmm. You present an interesting dilemma. Each of you seemingly has a legitimate claim to the bicycle, and yet the bicycle can have only one rightful owner. Quite the conundrum. As a federal employee, I believe the law is all we have. (getting worked up) It's all that separates us from the savages who don't deserve even the privilege of the daily mail. (angry) Stuffing parcels into mailboxes where they don't belong!!... 

KRAMER

Newman! 

NEWMAN

...But, you must promise That you will abide by my decision, no matter how unjust it may seem to either of you. Do I have your word? 

KRAMER

Uh, yeah. 

ELAINE

Yeah. 

NEWMAN

Alright, let's begin. 

NEWMAN

(excited) Ooh, my cocoa! 

KEN

Why can't we use Seven? 

GEORGE

It's my name. I made it up. You can't just steal it. 

CARRIE

Well, it's not as if Susan's pregnant. You've already postponed The wedding. Who knows if you'll ever get married. 

GEORGE

Hey, hey hey. Don't worry about me. I'm not a waffler. I don't waffle! 

KEN

Right, we're both big Mickey Mantle fans, and we love the name. It's very unusual. 

GEORGE

(shouting) What happened to Soda?! I thought we all agreed on Soda. 

KEN

(emphatic) Well, we don't care for Soda. 

GEORGE

You don't care for Soda?! 

CARRIE

(worked up) No, no. We don't like Soda at all! 

GEORGE

(shouting) How d'you not like Soda?! It's bubbly, it's refreshing! 

CARRIE

Oh! 

KEN

What is it? 

CARRIE

I felt something. 

KEN

Are you okay, honey? 

CARRIE

I think I'm going into labour. 

KEN

Oh god, oh god. Okay, let's not panic. Let's just get to the hospital... 

CARRIE

Okay. 

KEN

...Alright? I got the suitcase packed, right here. 

GEORGE

What about Six? 

GEORGE

Nine. Thirt... thirteen's no good. 

GEORGE

Fourteen. (shouting after Ken) Fourteen! 

CHRISTIE

Are you okay, Jerry? You seem quiet. 

JERRY

No, I'm just a little uh, worn out. 

CHRISTIE

I know exactly what you mean. 

JERRY

Oh, I'm sure you do. 

JERRY

What in god's name is going on here? Is she wearing the same thing over and over again? Or does she have a closet full of these, like Superman? I've got to unlock this mystery. 

CHRISTIE

(horrified) Oh my god! 

JERRY

Oh. 

CHRISTIE

Ahh. I can't go to the movies like this. Do you mind if we go back to my apartment, so I can change? 

JERRY

Change? (thoughtful) Yes, I think that's a super idea. 

CARRIE

Are we almost there? 

KEN

Just keep breathing, okay. 

CARRIE

(deep breaths) Okay, okay. 

KEN

Okay. 

GEORGE

(to Carrie) You know, the thing is, I kinda promised the widow Mantle that I would name my baby Seven. 

KEN

Now's not the best time, George! 

GEORGE

(to Carrie) It's just that, I know her, and boy... 

KEN

(firm) George! She's in labour! 

GEORGE

(angry shout) So am I! 

NEWMAN

Well, you've both presented very convincing arguments. On the one hand, Elaine, your promise was given in haste. But was it not still a promise? Hmm? 

NEWMAN

And, Kramer, you did provide a service in exchange for compensation. But, does the fee, once paid, not entitle the buyer to some assurance Of reliability? Hmm? Huh? Ahh. These were not easy questions to answer. Not for any man... 

NEWMAN

...But I have made a decision. (revelatory) We will cut the bike down the middle, and give half to each of you. 

ELAINE

(shout) What?! This is your solution?! To ruin the bike?! 

ELAINE

Alright, fine. Fine. Go ahead. (standing) Cut the stupid thing in half. 

KRAMER

No, no, no. Give it to her. I'd rather it belonged to another than see it destroyed. Newman, give it to her, I beg you. 

ELAINE

Yeah, yeah, y-yeah. 

NEWMAN

Not so fast, Elaine! Only the bike's true owner would rather give it away than see it come to harm. Kramer, the bike is yours! 

ELAINE

What?! 

KRAMER

Sweet justice. Newman, you are wise. 

ELAINE

(frustration) But this isn't fair! Lookit, my neck is still hurting me, and now you have the bike?! 

KRAMER

Well, tell it to the judge, honey. I'm going for a ride. 

CHRISTIE

Here we are. 

JERRY

(looking around) Ah, so this is the Fortress of Solitude. 

CHRISTIE

Well, I guess I'll go change. 

JERRY

Yes, change. By all means, change. 

JERRY

August seventeen, nineteen-ninety-two. The same dress! She never changes! Oh my god. (looking around) She's gotta have hundreds of these dresses. 

JERRY

There must be a secret stash around here somewhere. 

CHRISTIE

Ahem! Are you looking for something? 

JERRY

What're you doing? I thought you were changing. 

CHRISTIE

No, I, I'm thinking we should just call it a night. 

JERRY

No, no. C'mon, put something else on. It's early, let's go out. 

CHRISTIE

If it's all the same to you, I think I'm just gonna go to bed. 

JERRY

You know, I'm kinda tired myself. Maybe I'll just sleep here on The couch. Then in the morning, you'll get dressed, we'll walk out together. Both dressed, different clothes. Well, I'll be in the same clothes. You'll of course be in different clothes, because it's your apartment. But we'll go downstairs, me in my same clothes, you in your different clothes. 

CHRISTIE

(unequivocal) Jerry. I don't think so. 

JERRY

You wanna throw something on and walk me to a cab? 

CHRISTIE

(gesturing) Get out. 

JERRY

(pleading) Tell me what you're wearing tomorrow. I'll help you lay it out on the bed. 

KEN

Okay, breathe, honey. Breathe. 

GEORGE

(to Carrie) You know, you're really being very selfish. It would be nice if you would think of someone other than yourself every now and then! 

CARRIE

(shouts) I'm having a baby!! 

KEN

George, you're not getting Seven! Now get outta here!! 

GEORGE

(desperate) Please! I have so little! 

ORDERLY

Sorry sir, it's family only. 

GEORGE

I'm family. I'm having sex with the cousin! 

GEORGE

Seven!! 

JERRY

Hello, Christie? I was wondering if we could get together again? (listens) Oh really? Well you can't break up with me over the phone. C'mon, you gotta do this in person. It doesn't even have to be one on one, you can bring a group of friends. I just wanna see you. Wait, don't hang up on me. (hurriedly) Why d'you wear the same dress all the time? Hello. 

KRAMER

(indicating the cereal) Hey, Jerry, if you're gonna be snacking on these, you can't expect me to pay for the whole box. 

JERRY

Alright, hobo Joe. I didn't wanna put a damper on your little Smorgasbord here, but it's the end of the week, so I added up your tab. 

KRAMER

(does a double take) Yikes. 

JERRY

I know. Pretty steep. 

KRAMER

Well, I don't have this kind of cash. 

JERRY

Few do. 

KRAMER

I'm good for it. 

JERRY

Yeah, well, until this bill is paid... 

JERRY

...the food court is closed. 

KRAMER

(opening the door) Alright. I'll get that money for you in five minutes. And, don't eat any more. 

ELAINE

Hey, that's my bike! Along the sidewalk comes a happy-looking Newman, pedalling the Schwinn for all he's worth. He rings the bell. 

NEWMAN

Gangway! 

ELAINE

This is my bike! 

NEWMAN

Oh no. No no no no. I bought it from Kramer. He was hard up for cash. Fifty bucks! (he laughs) Can you believe it? Of course, I had to make some minor modifications, you know. Solid tires, reinforced seatpost, heavy duty shocks. But, baby, this is one sweet ride. 

ELAINE

(chasing Newman) No, you better gimme back that bike. Newman, gimme... 

NEWMAN

Hey!! Help me! 

NOTE

Originally broadcast as part of a 60 min episode, with The Cadillac (2) 

KRAMER

Hey! You're back! 

JERRY

Oh, I'm back, baby. 

KRAMER

Yeah, how was it? 

JERRY

Great. One of the best jobs I ever had. 

KRAMER

Good for you. 

JERRY

I killed. 

KRAMER

You killed. 

JERRY

(taking off his jacket) Slaughtered. Wiped the floor with 'em and (hanging up jacket) not only that, the money was unbelievable. 

KRAMER

Unbelievable. 

JERRY

Yeah. Highest paying job I ever had. 

KRAMER

How much? 

JERRY

(reluctant) Nah, nah. I'd rather... 

KRAMER

Aw, c'mon. 

JERRY

Nah. It's not good for friends to talk about money, it can affect the friendship. 

KRAMER

I tell you how much I make. 

JERRY

And I'm always impressed. 

KRAMER

Just show me the cheque, c'mon. 

JERRY

Awright, fine. You wanna see it? 

KRAMER

I wanna see it. 

JERRY

Okay. 

JERRY

Here, check that out. 

KRAMER

(stunned) Whuf! This is unbelievable. 

JERRY

I told you. 

KRAMER

My god, you're rich. 

JERRY

(taking back the check) Oh yeah. 

KRAMER

I didn't know you made that kinda money. (subdued) Jeez. 

JERRY

What? 

KRAMER

I don't think I can talk to you any more. I feel inferior. 

JERRY

I never shoulda told you. 

KRAMER

You know, Jerry, I think this changes the relationship. I mean, I feel it. Do you feel it? 

JERRY

No, I can't feel anything. 

KRAMER

Well, what're you gonna do with all that money? 

JERRY

Actually, I was thinking of donating a large portion of it to charity. 

KRAMER

(pleased) Really? 

JERRY

(deadpan) No. 

KRAMER

Well, you should, Jerry. 

JERRY

No, to tell you the truth, I was thinking of buying my father a new car. 

KRAMER

Now, you see, that's nice. 

JERRY

Maybe a Cadillac. 

KRAMER

(smiles) Cadillac. Ooh-la-la. 

JERRY

Yeah. (thinking) That would really blow his mind. He's always wanted one, his whole life, he's never been able to afford it. (decisive) I'm gonna do it. 

KRAMER

You're gonna score some big points with the man upstairs on this one. 

JERRY

Oh, isn't that what it's all about? 

ELAINE

Who was Pippi Longstocking? 

KATY

Pippi Longstocking? (thoughtful) Hmm, I don't don't know. 

ELAINE

Did she have anything to do with Hitler? 

KATY

Hitler? (thinks) Maybe. 

GEORGE

Hey. 

ELAINE

Hey George. 

GEORGE

Have you seen Jerry? (sitting beside Elaine) I told him two o'clock. 

ELAINE

(indicating) You remember Katy? 

GEORGE

(distracted) Mm? (acknowledges Katy) Oh, hi. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. We met uh, skiing that time. You're uh, married to the eye guy. 

KATY

Also ear, nose and throat. 

GEORGE

Nose. (chuckles) What's the worst that can happen to a nose? What does it get? Stuffed? (chuckles) 

KATY

(amused) He's funny. 

ELAINE

Ah, you don't have to tell me. 

GEORGE

Ahh, ladies, please, please. (chuckles) 

ELAINE

Oh, you know what? He got engaged. 

KATY

Oh, you did? (disappointed) Oh. 

GEORGE

What? Is that bad? 

KATY

I actually would've set you up with a friend of mine. 

GEORGE

Oh-ho, yeah? 

KATY

You'd be perfect for her. She loves quirky, funny guys. 

GEORGE

(curious) Bald? Uh? 

KATY

Loves bald. 

GEORGE

Loves bald? (laughs) Wow. Who uh, who is she? 

KATY

Marisa Tomei. 

GEORGE

(taken aback) The actress? 

KATY

Yeah. 

GEORGE

You're friends with Marisa Tomei? 

KATY

That's right. 

GEORGE

(getting excited) That's, that's incredible. My Cousin Vinnie, I love her, she was fantastic! 

KATY

Yeah, I know. 

GEORGE

(more excitement) You were gonna fix me up with her? 

KATY

Yeah, she's just been sitting home. 

GEORGE

(fever pitch) Marisa Tomei's sitting home, Elaine! Wh..why didn't you tell me that Katy was friends with Marisa Tomei?! 

ELAINE

(deadpan) Oh, I don't know what I was thinking. 

JERRY

I want this baby fully loaded. (listens) Well, how soon can you get it there? (listens) Oh, that's terrific. (listens) Okay, thanks, bye. 

JERRY

Hey, guess what. I just bought my father a Cadillac 

GEORGE

Really? Wow, you're quite the good son. 

JERRY

Yeah, I'm a very good boy. I'm flying down there and surprising him. 

GEORGE

You gonna sleep on the fold-out? 

JERRY

(joyless) Yeah, yes. 

GEORGE

Uh, let me ask you something. You uh, you ever hear of Marisa Tomei? 

JERRY

The actress? 

GEORGE

Yeah. She's uh, she's something, isn't she? 

JERRY

Oh yeah. 

GEORGE

Well, you know Katy, Elaine's friend? 

JERRY

Yeah? 

GEORGE

She happens to be very good friends with her. 

JERRY

Marisa Tomei? 

GEORGE

Uh-hmm. 

JERRY

How does she know Marisa Tomei? 

GEORGE

I don't know, I didn't ask. 

JERRY

You didn't ask how she knows Marisa Tomei? 

GEORGE

Not the point! 

JERRY

Alright. 

GEORGE

Can I finish? 

JERRY

Go ahead. Seems like a reasonable question, is all I'm saying. I would've asked her. 

GEORGE

Alright! So, she said, that she could've fixed me up with her. 

JERRY

What d'you mean, could've? 

GEORGE

Well, you know, if I uh, wasn't engaged. 

JERRY

Ohh! 

GEORGE

Coulda fixed me up with Marisa Tomei. She said I was just her type! 

JERRY

Really? 

GEORGE

(getting animated) Yeah. Yeah. You know the odds of me being anyone's type?! I have never been anyone's type, but apparently, this Marisa Tomei loves funny, quirky, bald men. 

JERRY

You know, she won an academy award? 

GEORGE

(sarcasm) Hu-hu, like I don't know that? (excitement) My Cousin Vinnie, I love that! I, George Costanza, could be on a date with an Oscar winner! An Oscar winner, Jerry! You know what that's like? It's like if fifty years ago, someone fixed me up with Katherine Hepburn? Same thing! 

JERRY

Now there's a match. You and Katherine Hepburn. 

GEORGE

I mean, you've seen her, right? 

JERRY

Katherine Hepburn? Oh yeah. 

GEORGE

(shout) Marisa Tomei! 

JERRY

Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

GEORGE

I mean, she's beautiful, right? She's just my type. The dark hair, the full lips. 

JERRY

You like full lips. 

GEORGE

Oh, I love full lips. Something you can really put the lipstick on. 

JERRY

Mmm-mmm. Too bad you're engaged. 

GEORGE

(downcast) Yeah, too bad. Too bad. 

JERRY

(about the pie) This is no good. 

JERRY

Hi. 

NICK

Hi, uh, excuse me. I'm uh, I'm with Plaza Cable. I'm sorry to bother you. I...I'm looking for the guy who lives over here. Been waiting about uh, heh, two hours. You uh, happen to know where he is? 

JERRY

No. 

NICK

If you see him, Could you just tell him the cable company was here? 

JERRY

Sure. 

NICK

Thanks. 

JERRY

(about the cable guy) Nice people. 

GEORGE

Listen, lemme ask you a question. What if I got a cup of coffee with her? 

JERRY

Well, what about Susan? 

GEORGE

(worked up) I can't have a cup of coffee with a person?! I'm not allowed to have coffee?! 

JERRY

Would you tell Susan about it? 

GEORGE

(frustrated) Not necessarily. 

JERRY

Well, if you can't tell Susan about it, then there's something wrong. 

GEORGE

(shouts) Of course there's something wrong! (points at Jerry) We had a pact! 

JERRY

Hey, cable guy's looking for you. 

KRAMER

Oh, yeah? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

KRAMER

Oh. Yeah, I been getting HBO and Showtime for free. See, they just found out about it, so now they wanna come and take it out. 

JERRY

Well, said he was waiting about two hours. Seemed a little put out. 

KRAMER

Oh, was he? Was he? I guess the cable man doesn't like to be kept waiting. 

JERRY

You don't seem too bothered by it. 

KRAMER

You remember what they did to me ten years ago? 'Oh, we'll be there in the morning between nine and one', or 'We'll be there between two and six'! (quiet anger) And I sat there, hour after hour, without so much as a phone call. Finally, they show up, no apology, tracking mud all over my nice clean floors. (malice) Now, they want me to accommodate them. Well, looks like the shoe's on the other foot, doesn't it? 

JERRY

Boy, I've never seen you like this. 

KRAMER

Oh, you don't wanna get on my bad side. 

MARISA

...positrack, which was not available on the sixty-four Buick Skylark. 

SUSAN

Hey. (glances at TV) Hey what're you watching? What is that? My Cousin Vinnie? 

GEORGE

Yeah. 

SUSAN

I thought you saw that before. How come you're watching that again? 

GEORGE

I..I..I dunno. 

SUSAN

Did you know Marisa Tomei won an Oscar for that? Boy, she's beautiful, don't you think? I wish I looked like that. 

SUSAN

Turn it off. You're making me jealous. I'm gonna think you like her more than you like me. 

GEORGE

(forcing a laugh) Hu, ha. 

ELAINE

Hello. 

GEORGE

(whispering) Elaine, it's me, George. 

ELAINE

George. How come you're whispering? 

GEORGE

(still quiet) Never mind, never mind. I need you to do me a favour. Uhm, remember what we were talking about at the coffee shop earlier? 

ELAINE

No. 

GEORGE

(still quiet) Think, a second. You know, your friend was talking about me and, you know... 

ELAINE

Ech, George, I have no idea what you're talking about. 

GEORGE

(still quiet) The actress. 

ELAINE

What? 

GEORGE

(shouts) Marisa Tomei! 

SUSAN

What? 

GEORGE

(calling to Susan) Uh, ah, nothing. Nothing. 

ELAINE

Oh, yeah. Yeah, what about her? 

GEORGE

Well, uhm, I think I'd like to do it. 

ELAINE

What? (shocked) What?! George, no way. You're engaged! 

GEORGE

A cup of coffee. That, that doesn't mean anything. 

ELAINE

Uhh. No George! 

GEORGE

Elaine. 

ELAINE

Forget it! 

GEORGE

Elaine! (shouts) ELAINE!! 

GEORGE

D'oh...Oh, oh, the judge! I hate this guy! 

ELAINE

I can't believe you're buying your father a car. 

JERRY

And, best of all, it's a Cadillac. 

ELAINE

(sharp intake of breath) Hoh. A Cadillac! (impressed) Wow. 

ELAINE

I had no idea you had this kind of money. 

JERRY

Ahh, I uh, I don't like to talk about it. 

ELAINE

Yeah, I thought you were doing okay. I just didn't think you were in this kind of, you know, uh... position. 

JERRY

Ah, it's just money. 

ELAINE

(smiling) So, when're you getting back from Florida? 

JERRY

Oh, I don't know, play it by ear. Why? 

ELAINE

I don't know. (big smile) Just, things seem a little more exciting when you're around. That's all. 

JERRY

Are you okay? 

ELAINE

(squeaky) Sure, sure. 

JERRY

What was that? 

KRAMER

Quiet, quiet. 

NICK

Hey, uh, you know the guy who lives here? 

GEORGE

Yeah. 

NICK

(quietly angry) All morning I been waiting here. All morning. 

NICK

(still angry) The guy says he's gonna be home. I show up and all I do is wait. I'm getting pretty sick and tired of it. I'm not gonna put up with it much longer. 

KRAMER

I'm loving this. 

GEORGE

Kramer, there's a guy out here that... 

KRAMER

Yeah, yeah. I know, I know. 

GEORGE

(pointedly to Elaine) Oh. Thanks very much for yesterday, by the way. 

ELAINE

Jerry, he want me to fix him up with Marisa Tomei. I am not gonna be a part of this! 

GEORGE

(animated) Fixed up? A cup of coffee! A cup of coffee is not a fix up! 

ELAINE

You wanna meet her. You wanna see if she likes you? 

GEORGE

(defensive) So what? So what if I do? 

ELAINE

(shrill) You're engaged! 

GEORGE

(worked up) I'm aware! I'm aware!! But this is Marisa Tomei, Elaine. An Oscar winner! How can I live the rest of my life, knowing I coulda been with Marisa Tomei? She said I was just her type! She loves short, stocky, balding funny men! 

JERRY

I notice you threw 'stocky' in there. 

GEORGE

Yeah, what the hell?! 

ELAINE

George! It's cheating. 

GEORGE

(adamant) It's not cheating if there's no sex! 

ELAINE

Yes it is! 

GEORGE

(frustrated) Ahh! 

ELAINE

(looking for support) Jerry! 

JERRY

Uhm, hold, hold on a second. (pauses counting) I'm, I'm sorry, I didn't hear what you said. 

GEORGE

(pleading) Elaine, c'mon. Would you just make the call? (indicates the phone) Please, make the call. 

ELAINE

(distractedly) Yeah, yeah, fine, I'll make... 

GEORGE

(triumph) Alright. 

ELAINE

Eight-fifty. 

JERRY

Oh, right. 

ELAINE

So uh, how are you getting to the airport? D'you need a ride, or... 

JERRY

No, don't be silly, I've arranged a car. 

ELAINE

You sure? You sure? 'Cos, you know... 

JERRY

Maybe I'll let you pick me up. 

ELAINE

(big smile) Okay. 

ELAINE

Oh, hi. Uhm, is Katy there? (listens) Wh...? Uhm, what? (listens) Oh, really? 

ELAINE

Well, could you tell her Elaine called? Yeah, thanks. 

ELAINE

Huh, she's in the hospital. (concerned) She has an arrhythmia. 

GEORGE

(impatient) What about Marisa Tomei?! 

HELEN

Morty, what d'you have to open this box for? (waving at another box) There's already a box of cookies open. 

MORTY

I wanted a Chip Ahoy. 

HELEN

I don't like all these open boxes. 

MORTY

Look, I got a few good years left. If I want a Chip Ahoy, I'm having it. 

JERRY

Surprise! 

MORTY

(shout) Jerry! 

HELEN

(shock) Oh, my god! 

MORTY

What the hell are you doing here? 

JERRY

I'm a good son. 

HELEN

Just like that? No calls? 

JERRY

Just like that. 

MORTY

Boy, you are really something. 

HELEN

To what do we owe this great honour? 

JERRY

You wanna know? Come on outside. 

MORTY

Outside? What's going on? 

HELEN

Whenever Jerry comes, something exciting happens. 

MORTY

(laughs) Heh hah! 

JERRY

C'mon, c'mon. 

JERRY

Well, what d'you think? 

MORTY

Look at this! Look at this! (excited) You bought a Cadillac?! 

JERRY

I bought it for you. It's yours. 

MORTY

You what? You bought me a Cadillac? 

JERRY

I bought you a Cadillac. (hands over the keys) Here you go. 

HELEN

(sharply, to Jerry) Are you out of your mind? 

JERRY

What? 

MORTY

(to Helen) You don't want it? Are you kidding? 

HELEN

He's not buying us a Cadillac. 

MORTY

What are you, nuts? 

HELEN

It's a very nice gesture Jerry, but take it back. 

MORTY

(to Jerry) Can you believe this?! 

HELEN

I'm not letting him buy us a Cadillac. He hasn't got that kind of money. 

JERRY

How d'you know? 

HELEN

Oh, get out of here Mister Big Shot. 

JERRY

Why can't I buy my father a car? 

HELEN

Your father doesn't need a car. 

MORTY

Yes, I do! 

HELEN

Oh, Morty. 

MORTY

We're keeping it. 

HELEN

Over my dead body. 

JERRY

(under his breath) Well, this worked out just as I had hoped. 

MACHINE

Giddyup. 

NICK

Yeah, this is Nick Stevens, from Plaza Cable. 

NICK

Well, I waited all morning again. You said you were gonna be there from nine to one. 

NICK

I was there. Where were you? You think I got nothing better to do than stand outside all morning, waiting for you to show up?! 

NICK

You're not gonna get away with this! 

MORTY

Hey Jerry, look at this. My seat's got a memory, in case somebody moves it. I could be in prison for five years. I come out, my seat goes right back to where I like it. 

JERRY

That's what I was thinking. 

JACK

(pointing) Hello, Jerry. 

JERRY

Hiya, Jack. 

MORTY

(indicating) So, how d'you like this? 

JACK

Who's car? 

MORTY

It's mine. 

JACK

Yours? 

MORTY

That's right. My son bought it for me. 

JACK

He what? 

MORTY

My son bought me the car. It's a present. 

JACK

(disbelief) You bought it? 

JERRY

That's right. I bought it. 

MORTY

You ever see one so nice? 

JACK

Some car. 

MORTY

You wanna take a ride? 

JACK

No, thank you. 

MORTY

C'mon, take a ride. 

JACK

I don't wanna take a ride. 

MORTY

Why not? 

JACK

I don't feel like taking a ride. Do I have to take a ride?! 

JERRY

He doesn't wanna take a ride. 

MORTY

Uh huh. 

JACK

(worked up) What d'you think? I've never ridden in a Cadillac before? Believe me, I've ridden in a Cadillac hundreds of times. Thousands. 

MORTY

(skeptical) Thousands?! 

JACK

What? D'you think you're such a big shot now, because you got a Cadillac? 

MORTY

(dismissive) Ahh! 

JACK

(dismissive) Yaah! 

MORTY

Could you believe that guy? 

JERRY

Aahh! 

GEORGE

Anyway, I was thinking about what you said. About uh, me and Marisa. 

GEORGE

You know, about the uh, two of us getting together. And I know that I said I was engaged, but (laughs) uh, you know, it's really just something you say. It's like, going steady. You know uh, going steady, engaged, it's, it's all just stuff you say. (chuckles) Anyway, I was watching uh, My Cousin Vinnie, on the uh, on the tape the other day, and I was thinking that uh, you know, the two of us might take a meeting, as they say. (chuckles) So, what d'you, what d'you think? 

GEORGE

(urgent) Move a pinkie, if it's yes. Can you move a pinkie? 

KRAMER

Y'hello. 

NICK

(inexpertly disguising his voice) Hi, uh ah, Mister Kramer, ah, this is McNab down at the phone company. We've got a report about some trouble on your line. 

KRAMER

Hmm. Well, I haven't had any trouble. 

NICK

Uh, the thing is, we happen to have a man right in your neighbourhood. 

KRAMER

(playing along) Ohh, is that right? Well, I have been having a little trouble with my call-waiting. 

NICK

We can fix that. We can fix that. 

KRAMER

(sitting back on the couch) Oh, can you? That's funny, because, as it happens, I don't have call-waiting. Seems to me that the phone company would know that. 

NICK

Oh, right. (laughing it off) I'm sorry, I was looking at the wrong work order. 

KRAMER

Yeah. Could you hold on for a second? I've got something on the stove. 

KRAMER

Hey, McNab! 

KRAMER

Chunnel's on HBO tonight. Why don't you stop by? 

MORTY

Alright. Next thing on the agenda, the restoration of the fence at the Briarwood gate. At the present time, we are still accepting bids. 

HERB

C'mon Morty, it's been broken for six months already. What the hell are you doing? 

MORTY

Well, I, as your president, have to find the best price, and right now, I for one, do not think it's cost-feasible. 

JACK

(half to himself) I'll bet you don't. 

MORTY

What was that? 

JACK

C'mon Morty, the jig is up! 

MORTY

What're you talking about? 

JACK

I'm sorry. I'm sitting here, the whole meeting, holding my tongue. I've known you a long time, Morty, but I cannot hold it in any longer. 

HERB

What's going on, Jack? 

JACK

I'll tell you what's going on. Morty Seinfeld has been stealing funds from the treasury. 

MORTY

Stealing?! 

RALPH

What proof do you have? 

JACK

Proof? You want proof? He's driving around in a brand new Cadillac. Now what more proof do you want? 

MORTY

My son bought me that car! 

JACK

Your son? 

MORTY

Yeah. 

JACK

Your son could never afford that car. We all saw his act, last year, at the playhouse. He's lucky he can pay his rent! 

HERB

Jack's right! He stinks! 

RALPH

It's his material. 

MORTY

I tell you, he bought it for me! 

HERB

(bangs table with his fist) I move for a full investigation! 

RALPH

I second. 

MARISA

...go introduce myself. 

SUSAN

Hey! What're you watching? (looks at TV) Only You? That's another Marisa Tomei movie, and you've seen that one too. (jokingly) What, d'you have a thing for her? 

GEORGE

(laughing it off and trying too hard) Yeah, yeah. I have a thing for Marisa Tomei. Like she would ever go out with a short, stocky, bald man. (forced laughter) Hu hu, ha ha. Like that's her type. Huh. She's an Oscar winner. (nervous laughter) He heh. Besides, I don't even know her. It's not like anyone's trying to fix us up. Who, who would try and fix me up with Marisa Tomei? 

SUSAN

What are you talking about? 

MARISA

Have I told you how much I love you today? 

GEORGE

Not in the last fifteen minutes. 

MARISA

Well, I do love you very much. 

GEORGE

And I love you, Marisa. 

MARISA

Well then, c'mon, get dressed. We're going to be late for the premiere. 

HELEN

Impeachment? 

MORTY

That's right. Have you ever heard of anything like that? 

HELEN

Can they do that? 

MORTY

If they get the votes. 

HELEN

I told you we shouldn't have let him give us the car. 

JERRY

Didn't you tell 'em I got the bill of sale? That proves I paid for it. 

MORTY

It doesn't make a difference. They think we're in cahoots. 

JERRY

You know, you could put a fence around these condos, and call it an insane asylum. Nobody would know the difference! 

MORTY

No-one's ever been impeached before. I couldn't live here. We'd have to move to Boca. 

EVELYN

Hello? 

JERRY

Oh, hi Evelyn. 

EVELYN

Hello, Jerry. (to the senior Seinfelds) I just got off the phone with Saul Brandus. 

HELEN

What'd he say? 

EVELYN

He's voting to impeach. 

EVELYN

Not because he think you stole the money, but mainly because you never thanked him for giving you his aisle seat at Freddy Roman's show. 

MORTY

I did so thank him! 

HELEN

(admonishing) No, he never heard you. (prods Morty's back) I told you he didn't hear you. 

MORTY

Ah, he's deaf anyway. 

EVELYN

Now, my sources tell me, there's three votes for impeachment, three votes against impeachment, and one undecided. 

MORTY

Who's that? 

EVELYN

Mrs Choate. 

JERRY

Who's she? 

MORTY

Oh, that one. She's been a member of the board longer than anybody. She's very tough to deal with. 

HELEN

Maybe we should have her over for coffee, and explain our side of it? 

MORTY

That's a good idea. 

EVELYN

Okay. I'll see you at the Lichtenberg's, tonight. 

HELEN

(surprise) The Lichtenberg's? 

EVELYN

Yes, they're having a party. 

HELEN

We weren't invited. 

EVELYN

Oh. Probably they think you're too good for them. You know, because of the car. 

NOTE

Originally broadcast as part of a 60 min episode, with The Cadillac (1) 

JERRY

Last week, on Seinfeld. 

JERRY

Ow. Stupid fold-out! Why'd they put the bar in the middle of the bed? 

JERRY

Hello? 

ELAINE

(flirtatious) Hi Jerry. 

JERRY

Elaine? Wh..what's going on? 

ELAINE

(clears throat) I was thinking, I mean, I'm not really doing that much this weekend, and I thought, well, huh, what the hell, maybe I'll come down there and hang out a little. 

JERRY

(a little confused) You wanna hang out here, at phase two of the Pines of Mar Gables? 

ELAINE

Well, it's just two hours by plane... 

JERRY

Gee, I dunno what to tell you. 

ELAINE

Dammit! I got another call. Uh, hang on, don't hang up Jerry. 

ELAINE

Yeah? 

GEORGE

(urgent whisper) Elaine! You have got to get me Marisa Tomei's phone number! 

ELAINE

(impatient) Okay, George, I am on the other line. I promise you, I'll get you her number. 

GEORGE

Yeahhh. 

ELAINE

Goodbye. 

ELAINE

(smiling and flirty) Hi. 

JERRY

Hi. 

ELAINE

So, what d'you think? 

JERRY

Uh, I don't think so. 

ELAINE

(disappointed) Oh. 

JERRY

I'll be back on Monday. 

ELAINE

Well, if you need that ride, just uhm, gimme a call. (little laugh) Heh. I can meet you at the gate, Jer. 

JERRY

Yeah, yeah. Whatever. Alright, I'll see you. 

ELAINE

(urgent) Jerry? Jerry? 

JERRY

(putting the phone back to his ear) Yeah. 

ELAINE

(breathy) Bye. 

JERRY

Bye. 

KRAMER

Hello. 

JOHN

Hello, Mister Kramer? This is John Hanaran, from Con Ed. 

KRAMER

Ohh, it's Hanaran now, is it? 

JOHN

Yeah. We've had some reports of power surges in your building. It seems some jokers were up on the roof, and they must've damaged some of the wires. 

KRAMER

Oh, you don't say. 

JOHN

(a little confused by Kramer) Yeah. Either way, we need to get into your apartment and do a safety check. 

KRAMER

(impressed) Ohh, you're good. You are really good. 

JOHN

(confused) What're you talking about? 

GEORGE

Marisa Tomei! I, just spoke to Marisa Tomei! (sitting opposite Elaine) And I wasn't even that nervous. 

GEORGE

You know, I can't remember the last time I called a woman without being nervous. I, usually, I'm pacing all over the room, I'm... 

ELAINE

(looking at her watch) Okay, well that's all the time we have for today. Why don't we pick up with this next week? 

GEORGE

Hey, where you going? 

ELAINE

I got stuff to do. 

GEORGE

What? You can't leave yet. 

ELAINE

Why not? 

GEORGE

We have to discuss my alibi. 

ELAINE

Alibi? What does that have to do with me? 

GEORGE

I usually spend Saturday afternoons with Susan. She's gonna want to know what I'm doing. I can't use Jerry, he's in Florida. 

ELAINE

Oh, so you wanna say you were with me? 

GEORGE

Yes. 

ELAINE

(pulls a face) Puh. Okay, fine. You were with me. 

GEORGE

Wait a second, wait. Why are we together? 

ELAINE

What is the difference? 

GEORGE

Because, if you ever see her and it comes up, we have to be in sync. Hmm? 

GEORGE

Okay. Now, why do I have to see (points) you? 

ELAINE

Ah! Because, I'm going to the dentist, and I'm afraid, and I want you to go with me. 

GEORGE

(dismissive) It's no good. 

ELAINE

(pointedly) Okay. Fine. 

GEORGE

What? 

ELAINE

I don't like the way you just rejected my suggestion. 

GEORGE

Hey, hey, let's not get so defensive here. This is a give and take process. 

ELAINE

I thought that my suggestion was good. And, I think you could've been a little more tactful. 

GEORGE

(explaining, with lots of hand gestures) Okay, look. We've never worked together on a lie. Now, you don't understand how I work. I have a certain way of working. Jerry and I have worked together a few times. He knows how I work. It's not a personal thing, y'know? We're just trying to come up with the best possible lie. That's what this is all about. 

ELAINE

(weary) Okay. 

GEORGE

Alright? 

ELAINE

Okay. 

GEORGE

Okay. 

ELAINE

Fine. 

GEORGE

Good. 

ELAINE

Fine, fine, fine. 

GEORGE

Okay. How about this? 

ELAINE

What? 

GEORGE

(pleased with himself) You are having problems with your boyfriend and I am meeting you to discuss the situation. 

ELAINE

I don't have a boyfriend. 

GEORGE

(still pleased) She doesn't know that. We say that you do. 

ELAINE

(not convinced) Ech. 

GEORGE

It's good. Believe me. 

ELAINE

I thought my idea was just as good. 

GEORGE

The dentist thing? 

ELAINE

(pointed) Yeah, right. The dentist thing. 

GEORGE

Alright, the dentist thing was not good. 

ELAINE

Okay, alright. What's his name? Who is he? 

GEORGE

(after a moment's thought) Art Vandelay. 

ELAINE

(incredulity) Art Vandelay? This is my boyfriend? 

GEORGE

That's your boyfriend. 

ELAINE

What does he do? 

GEORGE

He's an importer. 

ELAINE

Just imports? No exports? 

GEORGE

(getting irritated) He's an importer-exporter. Okay? 

ELAINE

Okay. So, I'm dating Art Vandelay. What is the problem we're discussing? 

GEORGE

(thoughtful) Yes. Yes. 

ELAINE

(sighs) Yi-yi-yi. 

ELAINE

Ah! (explaining, with hand gestures) How 'bout this? How about, he's thinking of quitting the exporting, and just focussing in on the importing. And this is causing a problem, because, why not do both? 

ELAINE

(irked) Oh, what? You don't like that suggestion either? 

GEORGE

It's very complicated. 

ELAINE

(definitely irritated) You know, it seems to me that it's all you, and none of my ideas are getting in. You know, I mean, you just know it all and I am Miss Stupid. Right? 

MORTY

What're you doing? Are you making coffee? 

HELEN

Yeah. 

MORTY

Well, maybe you better make a pot of tea, too. 

HELEN

Morty, you're driving me crazy. 

MORTY

Look, I don't want anything to go wrong. If this woman votes to impeach me, I'll be a laughing stock. 

HELEN

You wanna drive a Cadillac? Expect to pay the consequences. 

MORTY

There she is. 

MORTY

Hello. Hello, Mrs Choate. 

HELEN

Oh, come in, come in. May I take your coat. 

CHOATE

No, no. I prefer to wear it. Nobody's taking my coat. 

HELEN

Ah, how 'bout a cup of coffee or something? 

CHOATE

Coffee? Ach. I'll take hot water with lemon, if you have it. 

HELEN

I'll see. (indicating the couch) Have a seat. That's a lovely scarf you're wearing. Where did you get it? 

CHOATE

Ahh, they're a dime a dozen. 

HELEN

Oh, hi Jerry. Mrs Choate, (indicating) this is my son, Jerry. 

JERRY

Gimme that rye!) 

CHOATE

Stop it. Let go. Help! Someone, help! 

JERRY

Shut up, you old bag! 

CHOATE

(shouting after him) Thief! Stop him! Stop him, he's got my rye! 

JERRY

Nice to meet you. 

CHOATE

Hello. 

MORTY

(holding Jerry's shoulders) Jerry lives in New York. You just came from New York, didn't you? 

CHOATE

Yeah. I was visiting my daughter, and I'll never go back. The crime there is just terrible. Do you know I got mugged for a marble rye, right on the street? 

HELEN

(sympathy) Oh, that's terrible. They stole a rye? Why would they steal a rye? 

MORTY

That's what the city's turning into. They'll steal anything. 

CHOATE

They're like savages. 

JERRY

Yeah, there's some sickos out there. 

CHOATE

(peering at Jerry) You look very familiar. Have we ever met? 

JERRY

You ever go to Camp Tiyoga? 

HELEN

Maybe you've seen him on television. 

MORTY

Jerry's a comedian. 

CHOATE

Naw, I don't watch TV. 

JERRY

(opening the door) Well, it was nice meeting you. 

MORTY

Jerry, don't go. 

JERRY

Ah, I think I'll go. 

CHOATE

So, Morty, what's this all about? What d'you want? 

SUSAN

Hey, where're you going? 

GEORGE

Wha..? I didn't tell you? I gotta go meet Elaine. 

SUSAN

Elaine? What for? 

GEORGE

I don't know. She..She's having some problems with this guy she's seeing. 

SUSAN

I didn't even know she was dating anyone. 

GEORGE

Yeah, yeah. She's seeing this guy, Art Vandelay. 

SUSAN

So what does he do? 

GEORGE

He's an importer-exporter. 

SUSAN

What kind of problems are they having? 

GEORGE

(not happy delivering Elaine's lie) Well, he uh, he wants to uh, quit the exporting and uh, focus just on the importing. And it's a problem, because she thinks the exporting is as important as the importing. 

SUSAN

Are you having an affair with Elaine? 

GEORGE

(trying to laugh it off) Right. C'mon! I'm having an affair with Elaine?! If I was having an affair with Elaine, I wouldn't tell you I'm going to see Elaine. I would make up some other person to tell you I was gonna go see, and then I would go see Ela..Elaine. 

SUSAN

Huh? 

NICK

(yelling after the fleeing Kramer) I'll get you! I'll get you Kramer! You won't get away with this! 

MORTY

Alright, are you ready to eat? 

HELEN

(glancing at her watch) Oh, right, let's go. Jerry, let's go, it's time to eat. We're going to dinner. 

JERRY

(confused) Dinner? W..What time is it? 

HELEN

(pulling on a coat) It's four-thirty. 

JERRY

(bewildered) Four-thirty? Who eats dinner at four-thirty? 

MORTY

By the time we sit down, it'll be quarter to five. 

JERRY

I don't understand why we have to eat now. 

HELEN

We gotta catch the early-bird. It's only between four-thirty and six. 

MORTY

Yeah. They give you a tenderloin, a salad and a baked potato, for four-ninety-five. You know what that cost you after six? 

JERRY

Can't we eat at a decent hour? I'll treat, okay? 

HELEN

You're not buying us dinner. 

JERRY

(emphatic) I'm not force-feeding myself a steak at four-thirty to save a coupla bucks, I'll tell you that! 

HELEN

Alright, (sitting on the couch) we'll wait. (pointedly) But it's unheard of. 

GEORGE

...So, anyway, if you think about it, manure is not really that bad a word. I mean, it's 'newer', which is good, and a 'ma' in front of it, which is also good. Ma-newer , right? 

MARISA

(laughing) You're so right. I never thought of it like that. Manure. 'Ma' and the 'newer'. 

MARISA

Did you just make that up? 

GEORGE

What, you think I'm doing material here? 

MARISA

(laughs) No, no. It's hard to believe anyone could be so spontaneously funny. 

GEORGE

(modest) And I'm a little tired. 

MARISA

So, tell me, how is it that a man like you, so bald, and so quirky and funny, how is it you're not taken? 

GEORGE

Well, Marisa. See, the thing is... I'm sort of engaged. 

MARISA

What? 

GEORGE

I'm, you know, engaged. 

JERRY

Hey look, there's a spot right in front. 

DORIS

Was that delicious or what? 

JACK

Where you gonna get a better meal than that? 

DORIS

Better than Danny's. 

JACK

Danny's? (scoffs) C'mon! 

MORTY

Hello Jack. 

HELEN

Doris. 

DORIS

Hello, hello. 

JERRY

Jack. 

DORIS

Hello, Jerry. 

JERRY

Hi Doris. 

JACK

Hello Morty. (looking at watch) Well, missed the early bird. 

MORTY

Yeah, so? 

JACK

(pointed) Must be nice to have that kind of money. 

JACK

Bernie, look who's eating at six o'clock. (pointed) Your suddenly well-to-do president. But, you enjoy your last meal in office. Tomorrow, they kick you out, you'll have plenty of time to drive around in your Cadillac. 

MORTY

They're not kicking me out. You don't have the votes. 

JACK

That's what you think. 

MORTY

We'll see. 

JACK

Yes, we will. 

JERRY

Awright, let's eat already. 

ELAINE

Hi, Susan. 

SUSAN

Hi. 

ELAINE

Hi. Come in, come in. Have a seat. 

SUSAN

(standing) Uh, Elaine, I have to ask you a question. 

ELAINE

Oh, sure. 

SUSAN

(dead serious) Are you having an affair with George? 

ELAINE

(disbelief) Wha...?! (uncontrolled laughter) Ha ha ha. Ha, no. 

ELAINE

(laughter) Don't be ridiculous! (laughter) I mean, why would anyone wanna sleep... 

ELAINE

...Well, obviously... You know... (disbelief) Ap..ap, Chu... Why would you think I was having an affair with George? 

SUSAN

Ohh, because he said that he had to talk with you earlier about some problem that you were having. 

ELAINE

(recalling the arranged lie) Yeah, yeah, I did have to talk with him. I definitely had to talk with him. Having a problem with my boyfriend. 

SUSAN

Art Vandelay? 

ELAINE

Yeah, Art Vandelay. 

SUSAN

I'm sorry. (laughing it off) I feel like an idiot. 

ELAINE

(smiling) No, no. (laughing) Huh-hu-hu. It's okay. 

SUSAN

Oh, just forget that we ever talked. Okay? 

ELAINE

It is so forgotten. 

SUSAN

Alright. 

ELAINE

Okay. (relieved) Okay, no problem. 

SUSAN

So, was George helpful at all? 

ELAINE

(unconvincing) Yeah. Oh, yes, yes, he was very helpful. (hesitant) Uhm, because, you know, Art and I were getting into this whole thing about his business. Uhm, you know he's an importer-exporter. 

SUSAN

(not convinced) Yeah. 

ELAINE

(explaining, with gestures) Uhm, George felt that I was too adamant in my stand that Art should focus on the exporting and forget about the importing. 

SUSAN

(spotting an inconsistency) Wait a minute. I thought that Art wanted to give up the exporting. 

ELAINE

What'd I say? 

SUSAN

The importing. 

ELAINE

(caught out) I did. Uh... 

SUSAN

So, what does he uh, import? 

ELAINE

(extemporising) Uh... chips. 

SUSAN

Oh. What kinda chips? 

ELAINE

Potato. 

SUSAN

Ah. 

ELAINE

(embroidering) Some corn. 

SUSAN

And what does he export? 

ELAINE

Diapers. 

SUSAN

(fake smile) I'm sorry for bothering you. 

ELAINE

Oh, no, it's okay. 

ELAINE

Okay. 

ELAINE

(to herself) C'mon, George, pick up. Oh, pick up. Oh, pick up. 

GEORGE

Hi. 

SUSAN

Hi. (pointedly) So, George, what does Art Vandelay import? 

GEORGE

Matches? Long matches. 

HERB

...There she is. Okay, if I can have your attention for a minute here. We're calling this emergency meeting of the board of phase two, to consider a motion of impeachment of our president, (indicating) Morty Seinfeld. 

MORTY

Nervous, Jack? 

JACK

What for? 

MORTY

Because I have the votes. 

MORTY

Nice to see you, Mrs Choate. 

CHOATE

Hello, Morty. 

HERB

Building A. Are you for, or against, the motion to impeach? 

RALPH

What does that mean? 

HERB

It means, if you're for the motion, you're against Morty. 

RALPH

So why don't you say that? 

HERB

Hey, I'm running the meeting. 

RALPH

If you think so. 

HERB

Building A? 

A

For impeachment. 

HERB

Building B? 

B

Against impeachment. 

HERB

Building C? 

C

For impeachment. 

HERB

Building D? 

CHOATE

Against impeachment. 

JACK

(a whisper to Morty) I can't believe you got that old bag. 

CHOATE

Help! Someone help! 

JERRY

Shut up, you old bag! 

CHOATE

(after Jerry) Oh, thief! Thief! 

CHOATE

It's him. (pointing at Morty) It's your son. Now I know where I saw him. He stole my marble rye. 

MORTY

My son never stole anything. He's a good boy. 

RALPH

They should lock him up. 

CHOATE

(pointing at Morty) Like father, like son. (thumps table) I change my vote. I vote to impeach! 

B

Me too. I change my vote. 

HERB

All those in favour, say aye. 

ALL

Aye. 

HERB

All opposed. 

HERB

The ayes have it. The motion passes. 

HERB

Morty Seinfeld, you are officially dismissed as condo president. As vice-president, Jack Klompus, in accordance with the phase two constitution, is hereby installed as president. 

HERB

Hear, hear, Jack. 

NICK

(weary) Alright, I know you're in there. I know you can hear me. You win, okay? You win. I can't do it any more. What d'you want from me? Apology? Alright, I'm sorry. There, I said it, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I see now how we made you feel when we made you sit home waiting. I dunno why we do it. (upset) I guess maybe we just kind of enjoy taking advantage of people. (reasonable) Well, that's gonna change. From now on, no more 'nine to twelve', no more 'one to five'. We're gonna have appointments. Eleven o'clock is gonna mean eleven o'clock. And, if we can't make it, we're gonna call you, tell you why. (worked up) For god's sakes, if a doctor can do it, why can't we? (almost sobbing) Anyway, that's it. 

JERRY

The bags are in the car, I guess we better go. 

ELAINE

Mr. Peterman sent me over here for a physical because as you may or may not know, he and I are going on a trip to Kenya. Africa. My first such mission for the company. The Massai bushmen wear these great sandals and we're gonna knock them off. Not the Massai, the sandals. 

DOCTOR

I'll need a urine sample. 

ELAINE

Right. 

GEORGE

You know how hot it gets there? Like 150 degrees. Your skin is gonna be simmering with boils. 

ELAINE

Oh, Come on. 

JERRY

Hey George, you coming to the Tonight Show on Thursday? 

GEORGE

Hey, yeah. My parents want to come too, is that ok? 

JERRY

Yeah, sure. My parents will be there. 

ELAINE

The Tonight Show? 

JERRY

Yeah, they're in town this week, you wanna go? 

ELAINE

Are you doing new material? 

JERRY

No. 

ELAINE

I don't think so. 

KRAMER

Hey. Super's in my bathroom changing my shower head. Have they changed your shower head? 

JERRY

No, he's doing mine next. They're low flow you know. 

KRAMER

Low flow? Well I don't like the sound of that. 

ELAINE

So what are your parents doing here in new York? 

JERRY

Well, they were humiliated. I mean after the impeachment, my father left office in disgrace. 

ELAINE

So what are their plans? 

JERRY

Well, this is the problem. They're moving into this new development. Here's the pamphlet. Del Boca Vista. But they're not quite ready to go back so they're in seclusion here for a while at Uncle Leo's. 

ELAINE

You mean the three of them in that tiny apartment? 

JERRY

No, Leo's not there. He's got a girlfriend, Lydia. In fact, he moved in with her. 

GEORGE

Uncle Leo's having regular sex? 

JERRY

Yeah, I know. It devalues the whole thing. 

JERRY

(answering phone) Hello? 

MORTY

Jerry, what time do we have to be at the the Tonight Show on Thursday. 

JERRY

You gotta be there at 4:30. 

MORTY

But it comes on 11:30. 

JERRY

Yeah, well they tape it in the afternoon and then they air it at 11:30. 

MORTY

How long they been doing this? 

JERRY

30 years. 

MORTY

Helen, did you know that they tape this thing in the afternoon? 

JERRY

All right, I'll see you later. 

ELAINE

Georgie, how come your parents never moved to Florida? 

GEORGE

Yeah, that is odd, isn't it? 

JERRY

Yeah, it is. 

GEORGE

I mean, they're retired. 

JERRY

No economic reason for them to be here. 

GEORGE

They have no friends. 

JERRY

No social reason for them to be here. 

ELAINE

You're all grown up. 

GEORGE

Yeah, they're all through ruining my life. What the hell are they still doing here? Lemme see this pamphlet. Hm. All right, so I'll, uh, get back to you. 

HELEN

Where can I buy some ice? Your father likes a lot of ice. 

JERRY

I don't know, maybe get an ice tray? 

HELEN

I can do that. 

JERRY

You know Dad just called me. 

HELEN

Yeah, I know. His phlebitis is acting up. 

JERRY

Yeah, all right, well I got some people here. 

HELEN

Ok. 

JERRY

All right, bye. (to Elaine): You see this? Any thought pops into their head they're calling me because it's a local call now. 

ELAINE

Ahh. 

JERRY

I'm used to a 1200 mile buffer zone. I can't handle this. Plus I got the dinners, I got the pop ins. They pop in! It's brutal! 

ELAINE

They have no idea when they're going back to Florida? 

JERRY

The only way out of this is if Leo breaks up with his girlfriend and has to move back into the apartment and then they would have to go back to Florida. 

ELAINE

How's that gonna happen? 

LEO

It's about time you called your uncle. We've got to do this once a week. 

JERRY

(to himself) Once a week? (to Uncle Leo) So how's Lydia? 

LEO

Ah, she's a real tiger. 

JERRY

I don't know how you do it. 

LEO

What? 

JERRY

A man like you, limiting yourself to one woman, I don't know. But it's none of my business. 

LEO

What are you talking about? 

JERRY

Well... 

LEO

Look at this, I told them medium rare, it's medium. 

JERRY

Hey, it happens. 

LEO

I bet that cook is an anti-Semite. 

JERRY

He has no idea who you are. 

LEO

They don't just overcook a hamburger, Jerry. 

JERRY

All right. Anyway, the point I was making before Goerbbles made your hamburger is a man like you could be dating women twenty years younger. C'mon Uncle Leo, I've seen the way women look at you. When's the last time you looked in a mirror? You're an Adonis! You've got beautiful features, lovely skin, you're in the prime of your life here, you should be swinging. If I were you I'd tell this Lydia character, 'It's been real,' move back into that bachelor pad and put out a sign; Open for business. 

LEO

Believe me, I thought about it. But she is so perfect in every way, I can't see a flaw. 

JERRY

Well, keep looking. 

PETERMAN

I'm afraid I have some bad news, Elaine. It appears you will not be accompanying me to Africa. 

ELAINE

What? Why not? 

PETERMAN

I'm afraid it's your urine, Elaine. You tested positive for opium. 

ELAINE

Opium? 

PETERMAN

That's right, Elaine. White lotus. Yam-yam. Shanghai Sally. 

ELAINE

Ihat's impossible, I've never done a drug in my life. Dr. Strugatz must have made a mistake. 

PETERMAN

Not a chance. I'm afraid I'll just have to find someone else to accompany me on my journey. The dark continent is no place for an addict, Elaine. 

ELAINE

Obviously, Mr. Peterman, there's something wrong with this test. I don't take opium. Let me take another one, please? I'll call the doctor right now, I'll take a pop urine test. 

PETERMAN

All right, Elaine. 

ELAINE

Oh, thank you Mr. Peterman. (Drinks a glass of water) I'll be ready in three minutes. 

GEORGE

Whew! Boy, it's cold outside, huh? Oh, these New York winters, huh. Bitter cold, bitter. 

FRANK

I was out for five minutes before, I couldn't feel my extremities. 

ESTELLE

What extremities? 

GEORGE

You know what the temperature in Florida is today? Eh? Seventy-nine. That's almost eighty. Yeah, I read someplace the life expectancy in Florida is eighty-one and in Queens, seventy-three. 

ESTELLE

So George, why are you here? 

GEORGE

What, I can't stop by and visit my parents? (Drops pamphlet on coffee table) 

ESTELLE

What's this. 

GEORGE

That's where the Seinfeld's are moving. They got a great deal. Yep. You know what they got in Florida? Jai-Alai! You bet on the games, you clean up. 

ESTELLE

I don't bet. 

GEORGE

What about the dolphins? You could swim with the dolphins down there. 

ESTELLE

I don't swim. 

GEORGE

You could pet them. They come right out of the water onto the sidewalks. 

ESTELLE

Are you trying to get rid of us? 

GEORGE

Rid? Nah, c'mon, the word is 'care'. Care. I care about your comfort, be it here in Queens or twelve-hundred miles away. 

ELAINE

No? 

KRAMER

Jerry? Jerry! 

KRAMER

Wha, you too? 

JERRY

Yeah! 

KRAMER

These showers are horrible. There's no pressure, I can't get the shampoo out of my hair. 

JERRY

Me either. 

KRAMER

If I don't have a good shower I am not myself. I feel weak and ineffectual. I'm not Kramer. 

JERRY

You? What about me? I got the Tonight Show tonight. I'm gonna have to shower in the dressing room. 

KRAMER

(leaving) Aw. 

JERRY

Where are you going? 

KRAMER

I gotta find another shower. 

KRAMER

They got you too? 

NEWMAN

This stuff is awful! I'm not Newman! 

KRAMER

Oh, Elaine. Yeah. 

ELAINE

Kramer, you look terrible. 

KRAMER

Look, I need the keys to your apartment, I gotta take a shower. 

ELAINE

What's wrong with your shower? 

KRAMER

There's no water pressure. 

ELAINE

Why don't you just go see Jerry? 

KRAMER

Jerry's got nothing. Newman's got nothing. You're the only one I know who's got the good stuff, and I need it bad, baby, cause I feel like I got bugs crawling up my skin. Now you gotta help me out. 

PETERMAN

(busting in) Not on my watch! (Grabs Kramer by the collar) I won't have you turning my office into a den of iniquity! Get your fix somewhere else! 

ELAINE

Mr Peterman! What are you doing? 

PETERMAN

Elaine, you're out of control. You need help. 

ELAINE

Huh? 

PETERMAN

I know what you're going through. I too once fell under the spell of opium. It was 1979. I was travelling the Yangtzee in search of a Mongolian horsehair vest. I had got to the market after sundown, all of the clothing traders had gone, but a different sort of trader still lurked about. 'Just a taste,' he said. That was all it took. 

ELAINE

Mr. Peterman, I don't know what's going on here. I am not addicted to anything. 

PETERMAN

Oh, Elaine. The toll road of denial is a long and dangerous one. The price? Your soul. Oh, and by the way, you have til' 5:00 to clear out your desk. You're fired. 

HELEN

All they serve is chicken? 

JERRY

There's more food down the hall. 

MORTY

Wrap it up, we'll take it home. 

JERRY

Oh, hi. 

ESTELLE

Hello Seinfelds. 

MORTY

Hello. 

HELEN

Hi. 

FRANK

This is your dressing room? They treat you like Toscanini. 

ESTELLE

Oh, Jerry. I don't know how you could do this. I'm so nervous for you. 

JERRY

Actually, I'm drunk. 

GEORGE

Hey, hey, how was Florida? 

MORTY

Well, we just bought a new place down there. 

ESTELLE

I know, we were looking at the brochure. 

MORTY

What? 

HELEN

Why, you thinking of moving? 

FRANK

Not really. 

MORTY

Because if you are, you shouldn't. There's nothing available in that development. 

FRANK

Are you telling me there's not one condo available in all of Del Boca Vista? 

MORTY

That's right. They went like hotcakes. 

FRANK

How'd you get yours? 

MORTY

Got lucky. 

FRANK

Are you trying to keep us out of Del Boca Vista?! 

JERRY

I know this doesn't seem like work to any of you, if you could perhaps conduct your psychopath convention down the hall, I could just get a little personal space. 

ELAINE

How could I have tested positive twice? Once I could understand, that's a mistake. But twice? 

WAITRESS

Yeah, it's hard to figure. 

ELAINE

I mean I lost my job, I can't go to Africa. I was gonna meet the bush-men of the Kalahari. 

WAITRESS

Ah, the bush-men? 

ELAINE

And the bush-women. 

MAN

(also seated at the counter) Excuse me. I couldn't help overhearing. I notice you're eating a poppy seed muffin. 

ELAINE

Yeah, I eat these muffins all the time. 

MAN

Well, you know what opium is made from... 

ELAINE

(as though receiving a revelation) Poppies! 

LENO

Welcome back. Talking with Jerry Seinfeld. Jerry, lemme ask you, I saw some people back there, they look like.. family? Is that family? 

JERRY

Yeah, I got some family backstage. Course my family's nuts; they're crazy. Yep. My uncle Leo, (quick take of Uncle Leo in bet with Lydia, watching Jerry on TV. Lydia is laughing, Leo is not) I had lunch with him the other day, he's one of these guys that anything goes wrong in life, he blames it on anti-Semitism. You know what I mean, the spaghetti's not al dente? Cook's an anti-Semite. Loses a bet on a horse. Secretariat? Anti-Semitic. Doesn't get a good seat at the temple. Rabbi? Anti-Semite. 

JERRY

Hey, listen to this, Uncle Leo broke up with his girlfriend because of the bit I did. She thought it was funny, so he accused *her* of being an anti-Semite. They had a huge fight and now he's moving back into his apartment. You know what this means, my parents are gonna go back to Florida... What? What number is this? Oh, I'm terribly sorry. 

JERRY

Hey Kramer, my parents are gonna have to move back to Florida, isn't that great? 

KRAMER

(halfheartedly) Yeah, well I'm really happy for ya. 

JERRY

Hey, you're not giving it to me, man. What's wrong? 

KRAMER

I just took a bath, Jerry. A bath? 

JERRY

No good? 

KRAMER

It's disgusting. I'm sitting there in a tepid pool of my own filth. All kinds of microscopic parasites and organisms having sex all around me. 

JERRY

Well, you used to sit in that hot tub? 

KRAMER

Jerry, that was superheated water, nothing could live in that. 

JERRY

(offering a plate) Chicken? 

KRAMER

Oh, yeah. 

ELAINE

Well, this you're not gonna believe. I found out why I was testing positive for opium. Poppy seeds! 

JERRY

Poppy seeds! 

KRAMER

Well, that makes sense. (Offers plate to Elaine) Want some chicken? 

ELAINE

Yeah. Thanks. So, I'm gonna get tested again later, hopefully I'll get my job back and I will be on my way to Africa. 

JERRY

Hello Newman. 

NEWMAN

Hello Jerry. Well, I may have a solution to our little problem. Elaine, would you excuse us? 

ELAINE

Oh c'mon, Newman. 

NEWMAN

I have a private matter to discuss with my fellow tenants. (Opens door) If you don't mind? 

ELAINE

Jerry? 

NEWMAN

Look, sister, go get yourself a cup of coffee, all right? Beat it! (Pushes Elaine out the door and closes it) All right, now here's the lowdown. From a certain connection, I've been able to locate some black market shower heads. They're all made in the former Yugoslavia, and from what I hear the Serbs are fanatic about their showers. 

JERRY

Not from the footage I've seen. 

NEWMAN

Nevertheless, sometime this afternoon, behind the Market Diner, an unmarked van will be waiting. I'm expecting the call at any time. Are you in? 

KRAMER

I'm down. 

NEWMAN

Jerry? 

ESTELLE

So, Georgie, we have some big news for you. 

GEORGE

Big news? 

ESTELLE

We're moving to Florida. 

GEORGE

(ecstatic) What? You're moving to Florida!?! That's wonderful! I'm so happy! (pause) For you! I'm so happy for you! Oh, what do you need this cold weather for? 

FRANK

Has nothing to do with the weather, it's because of the Seinfelds. 

GEORGE

What do you mean? 

FRANK

They don't want us there, so we're going. We're moving right into Del Boca Vista! 

GEORGE

So you're moving there for spite! 

FRANK

Absolutely. No one tells Frank Costanza what to do! 

GEORGE

That's right, who the hell are they? How dare they?! 

ESTELLE

So, Georgie, are you gonna come to visit us? 

GEORGE

Oh, every chance I get. 

ESTELLE

(warmly) Ohhh. 

GEORGE

Jerry? Jerry! I'm busting! I'm busting! 

JERRY

What's going on? 

GEORGE

My parents are moving to Florida! 

JERRY

Are you kidding? 

GEORGE

Can you believe it? It's happening! It's finally happening! I'm free!! 

JERRY

Where are they moving to? 

GEORGE

Del Boca Vista! 

JERRY

Del Boca Vista, that's where my parents are gonna live! 

GEORGE

I know! 

JERRY

We could visit together! 

GEORGE

Every five years! 

JERRY

That's incredible! 

GEORGE

I know, I know and you know *why* they're moving there? 

JERRY

Why? 

GEORGE

To spite your parents! 

JERRY

To spite my parents? 

GEORGE

Yeah! 

JERRY

Your parents are crazy! 

GEORGE

I know, they're out of their minds! It's fantastic! 

JERRY

My parents are moving back too! 

GEORGE

Beautiful! 

MORTY

I'm sorry Leo's moving back here. I'm not ready to go back to Florida. 

HELEN

He was getting along so well with that woman, what happened? 

MORTY

Hello? 

VOICE

This is Frank Costanza. 

MORTY

What do you want? 

FRANK

You think you could keep us out of Florida? We're moving in lock, stock and barrel. We're gonna be in the pool. We're gonna be in the clubhouse. We're gonna be all over that shuffleboard court! And I dare you to keep me out! 

MORTY

I'm sorry, we can't go back to Florida. 

GEORGE

I can't believe I didn't push for this sooner. 

JERRY

You have no idea how your life is gonna improve as a result of this. Food tastes better. The air seems fresher. You'll have more energy and self confidence than you ever dreamed of. 

JERRY

Hello. 

MORTY

Hello, Jerry? It's your father. 

JERRY

Oh, hi dad. 

MORTY

Listen, is it all right if we move in with you for a little while? Sounds of breaking glass, Jerry dropped his bottle. 

MORTY

What was that? 

JERRY

Nothing. A bottle broke. That's all. What do you mean, you're gonna move in here? 

MORTY

Because the Costanzas are moving into Del Boca Vista. 

JERRY

But it's a big complex. 

MORTY

You don't understand, you gotta have a buffer zone. 

JERRY

All right, fine. Come over here. (Hangs up phone) 

GEORGE

What? 

JERRY

They're not going back to Florida. They're moving here. 

GEORGE

What? Why? 

JERRY

Because your parents are going down there. My buffer zone just went from twelve hundred miles down to two feet! You gotta do something. 

GEORGE

Hey, I'm sorry, you had your buffer zone for many years. It's my turn to live, baby. 

JERRY

You know what you're doing, don't you? You're killing Independent Jerry! I gotta go see my Uncle Leo. I think he may have made a big mistake. 

LEO

Move back with Lydia? 

JERRY

C'mon, you're lucky to have anybody. 

LEO

Last week you told me I was in my prime, I should be swinging. 

JERRY

Swinging? What are you, out of your mind? Look at you, you're disgusting. You're bald, you're paunchy, all kinds of sounds are emanating from your body twenty-four hours a day. If there's a woman that can take your presence for more than ten consecutive seconds, you should hang on to her like grim death. Which is not far off, by the way. 

LEO

But she's an anti-Semite. 

JERRY

Can you blame her? 

HELEN

You don't think he minds us staying here, do you? 

MORTY

Why would he mind? We're his parents. 

ELAINE

Oh. 

HELEN

Hi Elaine. 

ELAINE

Hello. Jerry's not here? 

HELEN

No. 

ELAINE

Huh. (pause) Oh my god. 

HELEN

What? 

ELAINE

A poppy seed! It must have been in the chicken. Oh, I'm dead. I'm going to the doctor's in a half an hour. 

HELEN

Why? 

ELAINE

It's a long story. 

HELEN

Just a second, I have to go to the bathroom. 

ELAINE

What are you gonna do in there? 

HELEN

What am I gonna do in the bathroom? 

ELAINE

You gotta do me a favor. 

HELEN

Elaine, I really-- 

ELAINE

Hold on a second. Mrs. Seinfeld, I need your sample. 

HELEN

You want my urine? 

ELAINE

I need a clean urine sample from a woman. 

HELEN

I don't know. 

ELAINE

Oh please, Mrs. Seinfeld, please? 

HELEN

Well, what am I gonna do it in? 

ELAINE

Well, one of those glasses. 

HELEN

Jerry's glasses? 

ELAINE

Yeah, he won't mind. C'mon, you're his mom. 

HELEN

Oh, I could uh-- Should I use a coffee cup? 

ELAINE

Yeah, a coffee cup's fine. 

HELEN

Or maybe a juice glass. 

ELAINE

Yes, fine, fine, a juice glass is perfect. 

HELEN

This one is kind of scratched. 

ELAINE

It doesn't matter. 

HELEN

Howbout A milk glass. 

ELAINE

A milk glass, a juice glass, any glass, just pick a glass. 

HELEN

Jerry doesn't wash these very well. 

ELAINE

Mrs. Seinfeld, pick a glass! Pick a glass, Mrs. Seinfeld! 

SALESMAN

All right, I got everything here. I got the Cyclone F series, Hydra Jet Flow, Stockholm Superstream, you name it. 

JERRY

What do you recommend? 

SALESMAN

What are you looking for? 

KRAMER

Power, man. Power. 

NEWMAN

Like Silkwood. 

KRAMER

That's for radiation. 

NEWMAN

That's right. 

KRAMER

(pointing to the largest one) Now, what is this? 

SALESMAN

That's the Commando 450, I don't sell that one. What about thi- 

KRAMER

Well that's what we want, the Commando 450. 

SALESMAN

Nah, believe me. It's only used in the circus. For elephants. 

NEWMAN

We'll pay anything. We've got the (hands a wad of money to Kramer) What about Jerry? 

KRAMER

He couldn't handle that, he's delicate. 

HELEN

It's nice being back at Leo's Jerry's place was too small. 

MORTY

First Leo breaks up, then he goes back. What the hell's going on? 

MORTY

Who is it? 

SUPER

It's the super. We're installing new low-flow showerheads in all the bathrooms. 

MORTY

Low flow? I don't like the sound of that. 

PETERMAN

So as a result of your test being free of opium, I am reinstating you. 

ELAINE

Oh! Yes! What a load off. So when are we going to Africa? 

PETERMAN

I'm afraid I can't take you. 

ELAINE

What? Why not? 

PETERMAN

Elaine, according to your urine analysis, you're menopausal. you have the metabolism of a sixty-eight year old woman. 

ELAINE

But I wanted to see the bushmen. 

PETERMAN

Oh, and one more thing. You may have osteoporosis. 

JERRY

Well, it's been a great visit. 

MORTY

Jerry, I'll tell ya. The first thing I'm gonna do when I get back to Florida is take a shower. 

JERRY

Well, at least the Costanzas changed their mind and decided not to move. They couldn't bear being away from George. 

HELEN

George must be happy about that. 

JERRY

You have no idea. 

FRANK

Take my swim trunks. I won't need them. 

ESTELLE

What does he want with your swim trunks? 

FRANK

Why should they go to waste?!? 

JERRY

Thank you! Goodnight! (Walks off stage, sighing deeply. Instantly, a red-headed woman runs up and hugs him - taking Jerry by surprise) 

SALLY

Jerry! 

JERRY

(Trying to ward her off) Hey. Hey! 

SALLY

(Reminding him who she is) Sally Weaver! (Sees Jerry's expression - he still has no clue who she is) Susan Ross' roommate from college.. hello! (Laughs slightly) 

JERRY

Right.. Oh, I'm sorry. Uh, oh, so you saw the show? 

SALLY

Saw it? I loved it! And thank you for the free tickets. You are so funny. 

JERRY

(Modest) Oh, thanks. 

SALLY

(Serious) No, no, I mean it. You're very funny. 

JERRY

(Blunt) I believe you. 

SALLY

Oh, anyway, let me show you Memphis. I am taking you (Points to him) out to dinner. 

JERRY

(Grabbing his coat) Oh, I'm sorry, I can't - I'm going straight to the airport. 

SALLY

Ohh.. that's too bad.. Susan thought we'd really get along - I guess because we're both wacko! (Jerry laughs) You know what, um.. (Turns around, picking up a large gift from a table) You have to give this to them for me. Okay? Here. (Hands the box to Jerry, he struggles under the size of it) It's a wedding present. 

JERRY

Oh? 

SALLY

And Jerry? Be careful with it, okay? Be very careful. 

JERRY

Uh-huh. 

FRANK

George, as you may be aware, your mother and I are not moving to Del Boca Vista, Florida. 

GEORGE

(Resenting the fact. Nodding) I am aware. 

FRANK

So, I was wondering, would it be okay if I turned your room into a billiard parlor? 

GEORGE

A billiard parlor? 

FRANK

Regulation table, the hi-fi, maybe even a bar.. Give it real authenticity.. 

GEORGE

Well, that's.. Elaine! 

ELAINE

Oh, hi, Frank. 

GEORGE

(Sliding over to make room for her) Sit down. Join us, please. 

ELAINE

(Trying to come up with an excuse not to sit with them) Actually, I gotta get to the.. uh.. thing. 

GEORGE

(Somewhat stern) Oh, the thing's cancelled. Sit down. 

ELAINE

(Giving up) Okay.. (Sits, George laughs) So.. (Trying to think up something to talk about) Frank, did George ever show you that photo? 

GEORGE

(Confused) What photo? 

ELAINE

You know, the photo I took in Tuscany of the little man in front of the sign that said 'Costanza'? 

FRANK

(Interested) There's a Costanza in Tuscany? (Elaine nods) Did he look like me? Did you talk to him? 

ELAINE

I didn't talk to anyone - I was just walking by, and I saw the sign, and I thought George might get a kick out of it. 

FRANK

I gotta get that picture - it could be my cousin, Carlo. 

ELAINE

Who is that? 

GEORGE

(Muttering out, not really wanting to talk about his family) When the Costanzas came here, one brother stayed behind. 

FRANK

I played with him every day until the age of four - and then we separated. 

ELAINE

So, you weren't born here? 

FRANK

No. That's why I can never be president.. It always irked me. That's why, even at an early age, I had no interest in politics. I refuse to vote. (Yelling out) They don't want me, I don't want them! 

GEORGE

I don't know what you're getting all riled up about. There are probably a million Costanzas- 

FRANK

(Cutting him off) Don't bring me down. (To Elaine) Do you have another copy of that photo? 

ELAINE

No, I, I don't. But.. Well, the Maestro might. 

FRANK

The Maestro? What Maestro? 

ELAINE

He's this guy that I went to Tuscany with. He's a great guy, but I just wouldn't feel comfortable calling him. 

GEORGE

Really? Why? 

ELAINE

(Explaining) Because he hasn't called me since we got back.. I spilled wine on his 8 by 10 photo of one of his favorite Italian opera stars. 

GEORGE

Who? 

ELAINE

You know the Three Tenors? 

GEORGE

Yeah.. (Trying to remember) Poverotti.. Domingo.. and.. uh.. the other guy. 

ELAINE

(Nodding) The other guy. 

STEWARDESS

(Overly nice) Could I take that box for you? 

JERRY

Uh.. well, you better not. I'm supposed to be careful with it. 

STEWARDESS

Oh, then, I'll have to put your bag in the over-head. 

JERRY

Oh, okay.. 

STEWARDESS

There we go. 

JERRY

Ohh.. look at this.. 

KRAMER

What? 

JERRY

I bought a bottle of BBQ sauce in Memphis. I think the stewardess broke it when she tried to jam it into the overhead compartment because of this 

KRAMER

Well, don't press the panic button. I'm sure that we can still salvage some sauce.. 

JERRY

I don't care about the sauce. It came in this funny little bottle, and there was a guy on the label that looked exactly like Charles Grodin. 

KRAMER

(Taking some of Jerry's clothing over to the kitchen) I see.. 

JERRY

No, you don't see - because I'm going on the show this week, and this was going to be my bit on the show. 

KRAMER

Well, why don't you do your material? 

JERRY

I'm out. 

KRAMER

(Looking up, sighs) Well, you better get to work. 

JERRY

(Sarcastic) Thanks for the tip. 

GEORGE

Hey, buddies. 

JERRY

Hey. Hey, this is for you. (Taps the gift) It's from.. uh, Susan's roommate, Sally. 

GEORGE

Oh yeah.. (Starts to open it) Sally called Susan - said you guys really hit it off. 

JERRY

(Annoyed at the thought) Nobody hit anything off. She just gave me the box. (Looks over at Kramer. He is scraping the BBQ sauce off Jerry's clothes with a knife, then dipping some bread into it) What the hell are you doing? 

KRAMER

(Looks up) I'm salvaging the sauce. What's the matter with you? (Eats the bread) 

JERRY

(Pleading) Hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on. 

KRAMER

(Moving out into the living room) Jerry, why don't you do a bit on Styrofoam? 

JERRY

Like what? 

KRAMER

Well, uh.. (Starts to impersonate Jerry's act) 'What is this stuff? Why do we need this stuff?.. And why do they make it so small..?' 

JERRY

(Confused) Where's the punchline? 

KRAMER

It's all attitude.. (Makes a humorous face - mocking Jerry's) 

GOERGE

(Taking out a mat from the huge box) Well, this is certainly a crappy gift.. 

JERRY

A door mat? That's what she had me lug up from Memphis?! 

GEORGE

Pretty chintzy, huh? Considering the money she makes.. She's a big executive for Federal Express. 

JERRY

Federal Express?! Is she out of her mind? Why didn't she just ship it?! 

KRAMER

Look, it's personalized. (Holds it up, reading) 'The Costanzas' 

GEORGE

No, no. Forget it. I don't want it. Let's just get rid of it. 

KRAMER

Well, maybe your father would be interested in that. 

GEORGE

I doubt it. You know what he's doing now? He's putting a pool table in my old bedroom. 

KRAMER

(Interested) Oh yeah? Well, maybe I'll go out there and knock a few balls around with him. You know, show him a thing or two.. 

KRAMER

So, what's your game? What do you like to play? 

FRANK

Eight ball. 

KRAMER

No, nothing doing. Let's, you and me, play a game of straight pool.. hmm? 

FRANK

You like to gamble, Cosmo? 

KRAMER

Yeah, now and then - you know how it is.. 

FRANK

Five dollars a game, huh? 

KRAMER

I'll break. 

FRANK

Okay. 

GEORGE

What's all this? 

SUSAN

Oh, I'm just moving in some more of my stuff. 

GEORGE

(Muttering to himself as he walks to the bedroom) More stuff.. 

SUSAN

(Calling out) Oh, I put up my doll collection.. 

GEORGE

Oh my God! What is that?! 

SUSAN

(Rushing in) What? What is it? 

GEORGE

(Staring at the doll) This doll (Pointing) looks like my mother. 

SUSAN

George, it's a doll. 

GEORGE

I know it's a doll, but it looks like my mother! 

SUSAN

(Going back to the living room) Oh, get outta here.. 

ESTELLE

What's going on in here? (Kramer hits the cue ball, it jumps up from the table and flies off screen) Are you two still playing?! You've been up here three hours! 

FRANK

We still haven't finished the first game. 

ESTELLE

The first game?! 

KRAMER

(Explaining why they are doing so bad) Well, we're still, uh, learning the subtleties of the table. 

FRANK

(To Estelle) he knows the Maestro. He could have the picture.. 

ESTELLE

Oh, forget about it. It's not your cousin. 

FRANK

(Yelling out) You don't know that! (Estelle leaves, slamming the door) We're gonna go see him, huh? 

KRAMER

(Judging up his next move) As soon as the game is over.. 

FRANK

(Sensing the game is going to last a long time) Oh boy. 

KRAMER

Eleven, corner pocket. (Pulls back on his stick, accidentally crashing it into the window) 

GEORGE

What is this thing doing here? 

SUSAN

Oh, I used to love to sleep with my dolls when I was a little girl.. 

GEORGE

Uh, I'm sorry, I can't do this.. 

SUSAN

Why? 

GEORGE

I feel like I'm in bed with my mother. 

SUSAN

Oh, stop it. 

JERRY

Hey, Elaine, you have got to buy this new electric toothbrush I just got - the Ori-dent. 

ELAINE

(Just making conversation) Oh yeah? 

JERRY

Oh, it's unbelievable. Every time you use it you feel like you just came from the dentist! 

ELAINE

(Mock enthusiasm) Oh, that's dynamite. 

JERRY

Hey, what are you doing tomorrow? You want to come see me on the Charles Grodin show? 

ELAINE

Who else is on the show? 

JERRY

Uh.. one of the three tenors. 

ELAINE

(Interested) The Three Tenors? (Stands up) Which one?! 

JERRY

Uh.. It's not Poverotti.. It's not Domingo.. 

ELAINE

(Extremely excited) The other guy?! 

JERRY

(Nodding) Yeah, the other guy. 

ELAINE

(Screams out in joy) My God! I can't believe the other guy's going to be on the show! 

JERRY

Why? 

ELAINE

Because I ruined this autographed picture of him that belonged to the Maestro. You think I can go and get his autograph? 

JERRY

Why not? 

ELAINE

(Extremely giddy) Wow! The other guy! 

JERRY

Hey, you look awful. 

GEORGE

(Sitting on the sofa) I'm on no sleep, bro. 

JERRY

Problem in the bedroom? 

GEORGE

(Muttering) Susan has the doll collection.. one of the dolls looks exactly like my mother.. she likes to sleep with it. 

JERRY

Wow. You were in bed with your mother last night? 

GEORGE

(Long pause) ..Felt like it. I tell you, this doll is pretty spooky. (Takes off his glasses, rubbing his eye) It's freakin' me out man. And now I got to go back out there and pick up this doormat. 

JERRY

I thought you didn't want the doormat. 

GEORGE

I don't. Susan wants to have it out when Sally comes tomorrow. 

JERRY

Sally? (Getting upset) Wait, wait a minute - She's coming to New York? 

GEORGE

Yeah, (Smiling) Susan said you'd be excited. 

JERRY

Excited? I'm gonna kill her! She knew she was coming here and she made me carry that box?! 

ELAINE

Who's Sally? 

GEORGE

Susan's college roommate. 

JERRY

It's because of her that bottle got broke that I was going to give to Charles Grodin on his show. 

GEORGE

So call her up and tell her to bring you another one. She'll be delighted to talk to you. 

JERRY

(While opening a cereal box) I will - don't worry. (Plotting revenge) In fact, I'll have her bring up a whole case of the stuff. It'll be really heavy. Let's see if she likes sitting on a plane with a big box on her lap! 

ELAINE

That's sounds pretty juvenile. 

JERRY

(Pulling out the toy from the cereal box - he displays even more immaturity by holding it up, smiling) Hey! A dinosaur! 

FRANK

His name was Carlo Costanza. We played together everyday until I was four. If I could just look through your photographs, maybe I could recognize him. 

MAESTRO

Unfortunately those photographs are at home. 

KRAMER

Well, listen, if you bring 'em by, maybe we could interest you in a game of pool.. Yeah, Frank here - he's got his own billiard room. 

FRANK

(Trying to concentrate) Yes, It's, uh, it's.. uh, uh.. What do you call it, Kramer? 

KRAMER

A billiard room. 

FRANK

No, not billiard.. (Scolding) Not billiards.. it was.. Come on, already. Come on.. 

KRAMER

(Confused) What? 

FRANK

We call it.. the, uh.. 

KRAMER

(Snaps) The Place To Be! 

FRANK

The place to be! Yes! It's the place to be. 

MAESTRO

(Agreeing to a game) Ah, then I shall be there. And now, Gentlemen, (Making dramatic actions) if you will excuse me - I must prepare for the symphony. 

KRAMER

Oh, yeah? 

MAESTRO

(Noticing the expressions) Ohh, my pants. (Begins putting on a near-by pair of pants) It's an old conductor's trick I learned from Leonard Bernstein. 

KRAMER

Really? 

MAESTRO

You keep a perfect crease by not sitting in them before the performance. 

KRAMER

That's good thinking. 

GEORGE

You see?.. You see?! 

JERRY

Well, it doesn't look exactly like her. 

GEORGE

Jerry, come on. If my mother keeps shrinking, this is exactly what she's gonna look like in ten years! 

JERRY

Why don't you just get rid of it? 

GEORGE

I tried! I almost threw it down the incinerator, but I couldn't do it. The guilt was too overwhelming. (Grabs the doll, opening the door to leave) Susan's so attached to this thing. 

JERRY

Wait, where are you going? Don't take your dolly and go home. 

GEORGE

Hi, Elaine. 

ELAINE

Did you see that?! 

JERRY

I'm just glad it's outta here. (Elaine exhales deeply - getting over the scare of the doll. She moves into the apartment) What's that? (Pointing to a rolled up poster Elaine is carrying) 

ELAINE

Oh, it's a poster of the three tenors. 

JERRY

Oh. (Intercom buzzes, Jerry answers it) Yeah? 

SALLY

(Through the intercom) It's Sally. 

JERRY

Oh, did you bring the bar-b-que sauce? 

SALLY

A whole case. 

JERRY

(Letting her up) Excellent. (To Elaine) So, did you buy that electric toothbrush I was telling you about? 

ELAINE

(Blunt, to the point) No. 

JERRY

How come? I told you - It's fantastic. 

ELAINE

Eh, I like mine. 

JERRY

I've had yours, I'm telling you - this one is ten times better. Don't you believe me? 

ELAINE

I don't want it. 

JERRY

(Slightly confused by her behavior) I don't understand this. Why wouldn't you want to get something that's better if I'm telling you it's better? And it's not a little better - it's much better. 

ELAINE

(Not committing to the conversation) It doesn't matter to me. 

JERRY

Come in. 

SALLY

(Peppy) Well, here I am! 

JERRY

Oh, hi. Elaine, this is Sally. 

ELAINE

Hi. 

JERRY

How was your flight? (Wishful thinking) Pretty uncomfortable? 

SALLY

(Setting the box down on his table) Actually, the seat next to me was empty, so, there was no problem at all. 

JERRY

(Let down) Oh.. (Starts to open the box) Oh, wait.. (Holding up one of the BBQ jars) This isn't the sauce that I asked for! 

SALLY

That's right. It's a special gourmet sauce. 'The Pride of Memphis!' 

JERRY

(Complaining) No, no. I wanted the one in the little bottle with that guy on it that looks like Charles Grodin! 

SALLY

This is much better. And frankly, in Memphis, we think that other sauce as (Whispering) kind of a joke. 

JERRY

I know it's a joke. It's supposed to be a joke! Now I'm going on the Charles Grodin Show with nothing. (Sets the jar down angrily) Nothing! 

SALLY

You could just do your material. 

JERRY

(Peeved) I don't have any material! 

ELAINE

(Yelling out) He's got nothin'! 

DOLL

Georgie! Don't eat with your hands! (George starts eating faster) Why do you eat so fast?! You can't even taste it! 

GEORGE

(Losing it) Don't tell me how to eat! 

DOLL

You're wearing that shirt? You've had it for five years already! Why don't you get a new shirt?! 

GEORGE

(Trying to keep it down) Because I like this one! (Notices people staring at him, he quickly gets up, collecting the his coat and the tiny replica) C'mon, let's go. Let's go! (On his way out, he stops in front of a woman blocking his path) Oh, hi.. (Embarrassed about the doll, he sheepishly walks out) 

WOMAN

(To Ruthie, the cashier) That man should really be in a sanitarium. (Ruthie nods, agreeing) 

KRAMER

Now this is remarkable. I'm lounging, and yet, my pants remain perfectly creased. 

FRANK

It's him! (Standing up) It's Carlo Costanza! 

KRAMER

Come on. Are you sure? 

FRANK

I'd know him anywhere. 

MAESTRO

I've seen that man in Tuscany. Eccentric fellow. Reputation of being kind of a village idiot. 

FRANK

I still say we're related. 

MAESTRO

(Recognizing the currently playing song) Ohh, I love this piece. (Turns it up, then pantomimes that he is conducting the instruments) 

KRAMER

Alright, come on Frank. It's your shot. 

FRANK

(Complaining) I can't make anything.. 

KRAMER

(Like a professional) Well, that's because you don't know how to follow through correctly. 

FRANK

Follow through? What do you mean? 

KRAMER

Right here, come on, I'll show you.. (Gets behind Frank, holding the pool stick with him) Take hold of your stick.. alright, bring it back slowly.. 

FRANK

It's a little unnatural, but I think I'm getting the hang of it. 

ESTELLE

Oh, my God! 

JERRY

(Still ticked off) That woman is such an idiot! I was gonna do this whole bit on that bottle - and now I got nothing to talk about. 

ELAINE

Well, have you ever considered writing new material? 

JERRY

Well, maybe if I didn't have so many people in my apartment all the time I'd be able to get some work done. 

ELAINE

(Getting the hint) Me? Are you talking about me? 

JERRY

(Deeply sarcastic) No. You're never here. 

ELAINE

(Reflecting) Boy, that doll was really freaky, wasn't it? 

JERRY

Yeah. Really. (Forming and idea) Hey, you know what? Maybe I could talk about that on the show. 

ELAINE

What? 

JERRY

Show the doll - show the picture of George's mother.. it's pretty funny. (Moving toward the phone) I'm gonna call them. 

SALLY

Hello? 

JERRY

Hello, Susan? It's Jerry. 

SALLY

Hi Jerry, it's Sally! 

JERRY

(Disappointed) Oh. Is George there? 

SALLY

No, but he should be home soon. 

JERRY

Uh, listen, this is important. Tell him to meet me at the TV studio with a picture of his mother and that doll that looks like her. 

SALLY

Is this for your comedy routine? 

JERRY

(Obviously resents talking to her) Yes. 

SALLY

(Gasps) Don't worry. (Like a detective) I'm on the case. 

MAESTRO

(Sighs slightly) I, uh, think I'll get some air. (Slowly leaves) 

KRAMER

Yeah.. (Sizes up his next shot. His stick jams into the window as he draws back) See? This is no good.. (Looks around the room. His sights fall on the Maestro's baton) Hey, the baton. (Chalks it up) I got a hunch, fat man, I can't miss. (Measures up his shot) 13 in the side pocket. (Does just that) Giddy-up. (Moves around to the other side of the board, judging his next move) Six in the corner. (Hits it in) This table's mine. (A series of Kramer's plays are displayed, and, on the last ball of the game..) You know where it's going.. 

JERRY

Hey! 

ELAINE

Is George here? 

JERRY

Not yet. (Points over to a man sitting in one of the room's chairs. Whispers) The other guy. 

ELAINE

It's.. .. you! It's really you! Oh, I'm such a huge fan of yours. Would you mind signing this poster for me? 

CARRERAS

My pleasure. (Reaches for a pen as Elaine unravels her poster) 

ELAINE

(As he is signing) Oh, thank you so much. (He finishes. Elaine gives out a happy gasp) Thank you so much, Mr.. (Tries to read his signature) Camaro. (Carreras gives her a look as he is getting up) Mr. Casea? (He walks off as Elaine rolls the picture back up. Jerry gives his 'That's a shame' face) Well, whatever. (To Jerry) I'm gonna take this to the Maestro. He's, he's playing at the Queens Convalescent Center. 

JERRY

(Joking around) Well, that's one hell of a gig. (Turning around, he picks up a box labeled 'Ori-dent') Hey, look, I got something for you. The Ori-dent! 

ELAINE

(Mock joy) Ohh.. thank you. (Accepts the gift) Huh.. (Struggles under the size) Wha-- why does a toothbrush come in such a big box? 

JERRY

Well, it's a delicate mechanism - It, you know, needs lots of packaging. 

ELAINE

(Still trying to get a grasp on the package) How am I supposed to carry this thing? (She looks up to see Jerry taking his pants off) What are you doing? 

JERRY

Well, I want to sit down. 

ELAINE

So? 

JERRY

It's a trick I just learned from Kramer. It keeps a crease in the pants. (Folds his pants over the head of a chair, then sits down in another. When he sees Elaine's staring at him, he makes a 'Tada!' gesture with his hands. Elaine holds her hand up - as if to say 'I'll see ya.', and while she's slowly walking out Jerry gives her a salute) 

MAESTRO

(Making his exit, he lays the charm on Mrs. Costanza) Madame, you have been an extremely gracious hostess. (Kisses her hand) 

ESTELLE

(Coy) Ohh.. thank you, Maestro. (Giggles to herself as the Maestro leaves) 

FRANK

(Holding up a picture) Here, take a look at this. 

ESTELLE

(Looking at it) Yeah, what is it? 

FRANK

It's Carlo. I found him! 

ESTELLE

(Handing the picture back) You've been cooped up in this room too long. 

FRANK

(Yelling out) You never support me! Let's see what George says about this.. Where're my pants? (Takes his pair off a rack and leaves) 

KRAMER

(Taking his pair off, he inspects them) Aw, beautiful! 

SALLY

Hey there, Mr. Hairy legs! 

JERRY

(Surprised to see her, he gets up) Where's George? 

SALLY

Don't worry, I brought your doll.. (Pulls out an extremely different doll - this one resembles a baker) Tada! 

JERRY

(Complaining) No! That's the wrong doll! 

SALLY

Jerry, I saw the doll you were talking about - not funny! This doll's much funnier. Look, it has a little bowtie, and a cute little hat.. I think it's a riot! 

JERRY

(Slow whispering) This is a nightmare. 

SALLY

Oh well, I'll be watching. (Sets the doll down, then crosses her fingers) Don't screw up. (Leaves) 

JERRY

My pants! 

STAGEHAND

Mr. Seinfeld, you're on. 

MAESTRO

Elaine? What a surprise. 

ELAINE

I know you're very busy, but I just wanted to come by and give you this. 

MAESTRO

Ohh.. (Looking at the box) Ori-dent - that electric toothbrush I've heard so much about.. 

ELAINE

No, no, no. Not the toothbrush.. (Holds out the poster) this. 

MAESTRO

Ohh, what a sweet gesture. And autographed poster of my favorite tenor, with.. those two other guys. Oh, Elaine, this is magnifico! 

ELAINE

Oh, well, I just felt so bad about what happened in Tuscany.. 

STAGEHAND

(Yelling from off-camera) Maestro, you're on! 

MAESTRO

Oh, Elaine.. wait for me after the concert? We'll celebrate. 

ELAINE

Oh, ok! (Picking up the Ori-dent box, she knocks over a bottle of wine. It spills all over the poster) 

SUSAN

I want to know why you took my doll out of the house. 

GEORGE

I just wanted a second opinion. 

FRANK

(Holding up the picture) Take a look at this. Doesn't that look like my flesh and blood? Of course, your mother- (His attention is drawn over to Susan's doll. Like George did earlier, he starts to imagine that the doll is scolding him as his wife would) 

DOLL

Oh, stop bothering everybody with that picture. It's ridiculous! 

FRANK

(Walking toward the doll) Ridiculous?! I'll show you ridiculous! (Struggles with Susan for possession of the doll) Come here! 

SUSAN

(Pleading) No, Mr. Costanza! No, no! 

FRANK

(Holding out the head in his hand, he addresses it) There! Now what have you got to say for yourself?! 

GEORGE

(To Susan) I told you it looked like her.. 

FRANK

(Sets a gift he's brought down) Carlo! It's me, Frank! (Attempts to hug the guy, but he resists - pushing Frank away. He scolds Frank in another language) I'm your cousin, Frank! Aren't you Carlo? 

MAN

Carlo? No. Mi nome e Giuseppe. 

FRANK

(Realizing) What do you know.. Alright. (Picking up his present) I guess I was wrong. (Walks off) 

GEORGE

(joyful) June. It's June. 

GEORGE

(high-fiving) Hey! 

GEORGE

It's June.&nbsp;Mark's Michelle is a dog. 

GEORGE

June, June, June. 

GEORGE

(to passerby) Hey, he-hah. It's June, June. 

GEORGE

It's Juu-uu-une! Hey hay. Yes. 

GEORGE

I love Juu-uuu-uu-uune! 

GEORGE

June. Juune, baby! 

JERRY

What? 

GEORGE

The catering hall screwed up. The wedding is delayed until June. It's like a stay of execution. 

JERRY

Dead man walking. 

GEORGE

(pointing to Jerry in joyous agreement) Ha-ha-hah. This is my lucky day. 

JERRY

Well, one outta twenty thousand. That's not bad. 

GEORGE

Yeah. Hey, wait a second, you know, good news for you too. Susan's best friend, Hallie? Broke up with her boyfriend. 

JERRY

She did? 

GEORGE

Yeah. 

JERRY

So? Wheels? 

GEORGE

In motion. The wheels are in motion. 

JERRY

Beautiful. 

GEORGE

Aah, hey. (enthusiastic) If this works out, forget about it. Vacations together, movies together, dinner together. It..it's almost as good as if I didn't get married. 

JERRY

So, set it up. You know what, we could have dinner at the Friars Club. 

GEORGE

The Friars Club? 

JERRY

Yeah, I'm thinking of joining. Pat Cooper said he would put me up for membership. 

KRAMER

Hey everybody. (to Jerry) Listen, uh, do me a favour, will you? I got a hot date tonight with Connie. Knock on my door, wake me up in twenty minutes, alright? 

JERRY

Catnap? 

KRAMER

No, no, no, no. (comes in) This is evolutionary. I been reading this book, on Leonardo de Vinci. See, that means 'from Vinci', d'you know that? 

JERRY

(deadpan) That must be some book. 

KRAMER

Yeah, well, turns out that the master slept only twenty minutes every three hours. Now, that works out to two and a half extra days, that I'm awake per week, every week. Which means, if I live to be eighty, I will have lived the equivalent of a hundred and five years. 

JERRY

Just imagine how much more you'll accomplish. 

KRAMER

Oh, I got a lot of things in the hopper, buddy. 

JERRY

I didn't know you had a hopper. 

KRAMER

(smiling) Oh, I got a hopper. A big hopper. 

PETERMAN

Alright, people, I'd like to begin with a hearty hail and well-met good fellow, to Bob Grossberg, who's joining us from Business Affairs. 

BOB

Thanks. Hi everybody. 

PETERMAN

Bob, we have a little baptism by fire for you, so to speak. 

ELAINE

(whispers) Poor bastard. 

PETERMAN

(to Bob) I want you to handle all the fact-checking and the copy-editing for the new catalogue. 

BOB

Ah, could you repeat that? 

PETERMAN

(slower and louder) Why don't you handle all the copy-editing? 

BOB

(apologetic) I..I'm sorry. What? 

PETERMAN

(louder still) Copy-editing! 

PETERMAN

Eh, never mind. (turns to Elaine) Elaine, you do it. 

JERRY

Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld. Pat Cooper made a reservation for me. 

JERRY

(downcast) Oh, I'm sorry. 

HALLIE

(smiling) How embarrassing this must be for you. 

JERRY

(jocular) You just bought your own dinner. 

JERRY

(passing Hallie) 'Scuse me. 

GEORGE

(smiling) Ho ho. Funny. Isn't he funny? Funny guy. Ha ha ha. 

GEORGE

Friars. 

JERRY

Hey, not bad. (pointing to crest) I kinda like this little thing here. 

GEORGE

Hup, here we go. Here we go. 

GEORGE

(adamant) Ah, c'mon! I'm telling you, I can coach for the NFL. It's not that hard 

SUSAN

(to Hallie) Mmm, mm, mm. Hallie (points to her plate) taste this fish. It's really delicious. 

JERRY

(to George) That might be the stupidest thing you've ever said. 

GEORGE

(to Jerry) Oh, get outta here. 

JERRY

(to George) I mean, come on. (a thought occurs) No, the stupidest thing you ever said was when you said Steve Kroft from Sixty Minutes is the same guy from *Seals and Croft*. 

HALLIE

(to Susan) Mmm, it is good. 

SUSAN

(to Hallie) What do you think about having fish for the wedding? 

GEORGE

(to Jerry) You watch the old videos. (insistent) I'm telling you, look at him. 

HALLIE

(to Susan) Oh. Remember (indistinct) wedding? 

JERRY

Oh, come on. 

GEORGE

Look... 

JERRY

Alright. 

JERRY

(looking at Kramer) This is nice. 

KRAMER

Yeah, morning. 

JERRY

Morning? 

KRAMER

Yeah, what time is it? 

JERRY

(looks at watch) Ten-thirty. 

KRAMER

(pleased) Ah, see. (rubs his hands together) I got the whole night ahead of me. (looks at Jerry) Boy, that's a nice jacket, huh? 

JERRY

(realising) Ohh, I don't believe this. I forgot to give it back. It belongs to the Friars Club. 

KRAMER

Yeah, I like that crest. (he shakes cereal into the bowl) Alright, here we go. 

JERRY

Breakfast? 

KRAMER

(pouring cereal) Oh yeah. Most important meal of the day. 

JERRY

So this Da Vinci sleep is working out? 

KRAMER

(enthusiastic) Oh, I'm percolating, Jerry. I'm telling you, I have never felt so fertile. I'm mossy, Jerry. My brain is mossy. Listen to this idea. (fetches a spoon from the drawer) A restaurant that serves only peanut butter and jelly. (clicks tongue) 

JERRY

What d'you call it? 

KRAMER

P B and J's. What d'you think? 

JERRY

(deadpan) I think you need more sleep. 

KRAMER

(dismissive) Ahh. 

JERRY

So, how'd your date work out with the mysterious Connie? 

KRAMER

I am telling you, this woman is strange. She never wants to leave the apartment. It's almost like she doesn't wanna be seen with me. 

JERRY

Oh, now you're being ridiculous. 

KRAMER

(laughing) He he, yeah. 

JERRY

(indicates the bowl of cereal) No milk? 

KRAMER

Oh, I'll be back. 

KRAMER

(quietly) Jerry. 

KRAMER

(quietly) Hey Jerry. 

KRAMER

(prodding Jerry) C'mon buddy. 

JERRY

(startled) Kramer! 

KRAMER

You awake? 

JERRY

(confused) Wha..? What time is it? 

KRAMER

W...It's four. 

JERRY

(aghast) Four in the morning?! 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

JERRY

Well, what's wrong with you? 

KRAMER

I'm bored. I got all this free time on my hands, I dunno what to do. You wanna do something? 

JERRY

No. Would you just get out? 

KRAMER

You wanna rent a movie? 

JERRY

No! 

KRAMER

Well, what am I gonna do? 

JERRY

Ready for lunch? 

ELAINE

(irked) I'm stuck here, editing the stupid catalogue, because of stupid Bob Grossberg. 

ELAINE

Listen, there is something really suspicious about this guy. Every time Mr Peterman tries to assign him any work, he says he can't hear, and it all gets dumped on me. 

JERRY

You think he's faking? 

ELAINE

I don't know. But I'd like to try that earpiece on, see if it's real. 

BOB

Hey Elaine. (he spots Jerry) Oh, you have a friend. 

BOB

(to Elaine) Just wanted to say hi. 

ELAINE

Bob, you know what? I'm kinda swamped here. You think you could give me a hand with some of the catalogue? 

BOB

(cupping his hand behind his ear) I..I'm sorry. What? 

ELAINE

(slower and louder) I'm kind of swamped. 

BOB

Thank you. I'm having lunch with Mr P. I better get going. 

ELAINE

Did you see that? Did you see that, Jerry? 

JERRY

That was him? 

ELAINE

Yes. 

JERRY

Somehow I thought he'd be taller. 

ELAINE

Alright, listen, we'll have to do this again some other time, okay? I got a lotta work to do. 

JERRY

(standing) Alright, I'll see you later. 

ELAINE

Alright. 

JERRY

Hey, Bob. 

JERRY

Bob. 

JERRY

Hey, Bobby, over here. 

JERRY

Bob. Oh, Bob. 

JERRY

(louder) Bob! 

BOB

Hi. 

JERRY

(urgent whisper) Elaine. 

ELAINE

(makes an irked noise) 

JERRY

I was just in the bathroom. 

ELAINE

(really doesn't want to know) Okay, Jerry, please, please. I'm really busy here. 

JERRY

No, no, no. I was just in the bathroom with that Bob guy. 

ELAINE

So what? 

JERRY

No, I kinda tried to test his hearing. 

ELAINE

Get out! What'd you do? 

JERRY

Well, I kinda snuck up behind him at the urinal and tried to see if he could hear me. 

ELAINE

(hopeful) And? 

JERRY

Well, he flinched, sort of. 

ELAINE

What d'you mean, sort of? What'd he do? 

JERRY

Well, he kinda moved his head, you know. It mighta been on the zip up, I dunno. 

ELAINE

So you don't know anything? 

JERRY

Actually, no. 

ELAINE

(sarcasm) Alright, good job. 

JERRY

Right. 

JERRY

Come in. 

GEORGE

(entering) Last night, huh? Was that something, or was that something? 

JERRY

That was something. 

GEORGE

Ah. She's great, isn't she? 

JERRY

(positive) Fantastic. Fantastic woman. 

GEORGE

I told you. 

JERRY

I'm nuts about her. 

GEORGE

You think she could be an 'it'? Could she be an 'it'? 

JERRY

She could be an 'it'. 

GEORGE

(claps hands triumphantly) We might have an 'it'! 

JERRY

She's got 'it' written all over her. 

GEORGE

She's got everything, right? (counts on his fingers) She's intelligent, she's smart, she's got a great sense of humour. 

JERRY

Well, I dunno. I didn't really talk to her. 

GEORGE

Well, she's smart. You take my word for it. 

JERRY

Whatever. 

GEORGE

(gleeful) Hehee. W..we could be like the Gatsbys. Didn't they always like, you know, a bunch of people around, and they were all best friends? 

JERRY

That doesn't sound right. 

GEORGE

No. So, tonight she's got tickets for that show she's been working on. The Flying Sandos Brother. 

JERRY

Flying Sandos. Beautiful. 

GEORGE

Great. Seven-thirty, alright? 

JERRY

Walk me down to the Friars. 

GEORGE

Sure. So, uh, Jerry, there's an empty apartment in my building. If you and Hallie want, we could try and hold it, may... 

JERRY

It's not here. 

GEORGE

What? 

JERRY

Th..the jacket, it's not here. It's gotta be here somewhere. 

KRAMER

Oh, boy. 

JERRY

(to Kramer) Thanks for that four a.m. wakeup call last night. (frustrated) Where the hell is that jacket? 

KRAMER

Oh, the one with the crest. 

JERRY

Yeah. 

JERRY

Oh, well, that's at the cleaners. 

JERRY

The cleaners? How did it get there? 

KRAMER

Well, I, uh, I borrowed it last night and it got a little dirty. 

JERRY

(irritated) Great. 

KRAMER

(laughing to himself) Somehow I dozed off and woke up in a pile of garbage. 

JERRY

Somehow? You've had an hour and twenty minutes sleep in three days! 

KRAMER

Well, so, look, the cleaner said you could pick it up tonight at six. 

JERRY

Alright. I just hope I can get it to the Friars Club before the show. 

GEORGE

Won't be a problem...(mumbles) 

JERRY

(to Kramer) Hey. 

JERRY

(louder) Hey!! 

KRAMER

Watch out, boy. 

ELAINE

Can you give us a hand with some of these boxes, Bob? 

ELAINE

Bob! 

ELAINE

(sexily) I want you so bad, Bob. You turn me on... 

ELAINE

...so much. You're so damn...sexy. 

ELAINE

(sexy) Ohh. I'm starting to unbutton. 

ELAINE

(dropping the sexy voice) Anything getting through? Bob? 

HALLIE

Well, they perform all over. Europe mostly. 

GEORGE

A-ha, huh. (mumbles) tours. 

HALLIE

Yeah. 

JERRY

Sorry, sorry I'm late. 

SUSAN

Hey! 

SUSAN

Jerry. 

GEORGE

Isn't that the uh, Friars Club jacket? 

JERRY

Yeah, it wasn't ready on time. I have to return it after the show. 

GEORGE

Sure, sure, sure, sure. (patting Jerry on the shoulders) How about these seats? Are these fantastic, huh? Huh? I feel like Lincoln. 

JERRY

Yeah. Well, let's hope this evening turns out a little better. 

KRAMER

So, uhm, are you sure you don't wanna go to the movies? 

CONNIE

Mmm, no, Cosmo. I like just being here with you. 

KRAMER

Oh, it's uh, it's a bold adventure. 

KRAMER

Ooh. Well, this is uh, risky business, huh? I'm all a-twitter. 

JERRY

(smiling) I don't think so. 

JERRY

My jacket? 

HALLIE

C'mon. 

SUSAN

Do it. Come on, Jerry. 

GEORGE

Give him the jacket. 

JERRY

(giving in) Alright. 

CONNIE

(passionate) Oh Cosmo. Mm-mmm, Cosmo. Oh Cosmo. 

CONNIE

(uncomfortable) Uh, honey, can you move a little, this hurts. 

CONNIE

(worried) Cosmo? 

CONNIE

(panicky) Oh my god. Cosmo, wake up! 

CONNIE

Cosmo? 

CONNIE

(horrified) Oh my god! He's dead! He's dead. 

CONNIE

(into phone) Yeah, Tommy, this is Connie. You gotta help me. Some guy dropped dead on top of me. (listens) I can't call the cops, 'cos Joey might find out. (listens) I can't. I'm stuck. You gotta help me. 

GEORGE

This is very exciting. The inner sanctum. 

JERRY

Hi. I..I was in the audience earlier. You threw my jacket down. I just wanted to pick it up. 

JERRY

(explaining) I had a jacket with a crest on it. You came into the audience, you threw it away. Agrabah. 

JERRY

Well, it was either you or one of your brothers. 

JERRY

It doesn't even belong to me. It belongs to the Friars Club. 

HALLIE

Jerry, I'm sure it'll turn up. 

JERRY

(cynical) I'm sure it won't. 

HALLIE

Don't worry. I'll get the jacket back. 

GEORGE

(cheerful) Alright, there you go. She's gonna get the jacket back. (claps hands) So, let's go get some coffee, huh? 

JERRY

(downcast) No, I'm a little tired. I think I'll go home. 

SUSAN

Aww, that's too bad. 

GEORGE

Really? 

JERRY

Yeah, we'll do it another time. 

SUSAN

(bright) George, we'll go. 

GEORGE

I, uh, oh, broke a shoelace today. 

SUSAN

Oh, I can get you shoelaces tomorrow. 

GEORGE

Okay. 

SUSAN

So, what colour? 

GEORGE

Brown. 

GEORGE

Maybe a black. 

SUSAN

Mmm. 

WAITRESS

More coffee? 

GEORGE

(urgent) No! Check! (quieter) Please. 

JERRY

(looking after the guys) That nut is always up to something. 

KRAMER

HEY!! Sh..! Shii! MAMA!! 

KRAMER

AAH! AAGH! 

PETERMAN

Elaine. I think I've been working you a little too hard, lately. 

ELAINE

(shrugging it off) Oh. 

PETERMAN

So, I have two tickets for you (holds up the bits of card) to the Flying Sandos Brothers magic show. 

ELAINE

(pleased) Ah. 

PETERMAN

It is a real hoot. 

ELAINE

(delighted) Well, thank you Mr Peterman. 

PETERMAN

Ah, the tickets are for tonight. So you and Bob can knock off a little early, so you both can get ready. 

ELAINE

Mr Peterman, you... 

PETERMAN

(interrupting) There's no need to deny it, Elaine. I heard every word you said. 

PETERMAN

And I know you wouldn't be just having fun with his handicap. (staring away) That kind of cruelty would be grounds for dismissal. 

ELAINE

(resigned) Of course, Mr Peterman. 

JERRY

(into phone) Tell 'em I'll come down and talk to 'em. Okay, bye. (to George) Well, that was the Friars Club. D'you think they're gonna let a jacket-stealer join? I don't think so! They're gonna charge me eight hundred dollars for the jacket, and I gotta deal with Pat Cooper! 

JERRY

(worked up) Wh..what kinda show is that Sandos Brothers? They take your jacket, then they just throw it? I never heard of that! 

GEORGE

It's a little unusual. So, uh, Susan and I were thinking, uh, dinner at our house Saturday night. Just the four of us. 

JERRY

(unenthusiastic) Uhh, I don't think so. 

GEORGE

(worried) Why not? 

JERRY

(impassive) Ah, I'm a little turned off. 

GEORGE

(standing) C'mon, what're you talking about? 

JERRY

Ahh, I'm, I'm kinda soured. 

GEORGE

You're soured? 

JERRY

Yeah, I'm soured. 

GEORGE

Don't be soured. 

JERRY

I'm sorry. I'm soured. 

GEORGE

(animated) What're you kidding me? We were all getting along so well. Where is all this coming from? 

JERRY

Well, you know, frankly, I don't think she was too concerned about my jacket. 

GEORGE

(animated) What're you talking about?! She's very concerned! She said she was gonna get it back. 

JERRY

(indifferent) Yeah, we'll see. 

GEORGE

(worked up) Because if she gets it back, then you'll have no reason to be sour. You'll de-sour, right? 

JERRY

I'll try and de-sour. 

GEORGE

(aggravated) Oh, that's not good enough! You don't try and de-sour. You have to sweeten too! 

JERRY

(sharp) I'll try! I'll try and de-sour and sweeten. 

GEORGE

I wanna get it back when we were the Gatsbys. 

JERRY

I still don't know what that means. 

GEORGE

(neither does he) Yeah, well. 

KRAMER

God. 

JERRY

(astonished) Oh god! What happened to you?! 

KRAMER

(animated) She tried to kill me Jerry! 

JERRY

Who? 

KRAMER

(shouts) Connie! 

JERRY

What'd she do? 

KRAMER

I don't know! (building to a shout) But I woke up in the Hudson river in a SACK!! I think she drugged me, but she's a murderer and I'm calling the cops. 

JERRY

(bewildered) Why would she try and kill you? 

KRAMER

(animated) Well, isn't it obvious? She doesn't want anybody else to have me! 

KRAMER

(to door) Gah! 

JERRY

Hey, there's uncle Milty. 

GEORGE

(pleased) Yeah, it is. 

JERRY

(pointing) And there's David Steinberg. 

GEORGE

The comedian, or the manager? 

JERRY

The manager. 

JERRY

(to George) Hey, there's Pat. (calls) Hey, Pat. 

PAT

Hey, Jerry. What the hell went wrong? What's the matter with you? Are you a kleptomaniac, or what? 

JERRY

I forgot to take it off. 

PAT

(dubious) You forgot to take it off? Oh, you go into a department store, you put a suit on, and you walk right out. What are you some sort of an idiot? 

JERRY

I'm sorry. 

PAT

Where's the jacket? 

JERRY

Well, one of the gypsies took it. 

PAT

(skeptical) Aww, the gypsies took it! Of course, New York has a lot of gypsies! Oh, on every block there's a gypsy! 

GEORGE

(meekly) Well, it's true. I saw it. 

PAT

(probing) Excuse me, are you an entertainer? Are you in showbusiness? 

GEORGE

No, I uh... 

PAT

(interrupting) Then what am I talking to you for? (to Jerry) Jerry, bring the jacket back tomorrow. 

JERRY

Alright. 

GEORGE

Wait a minute, wait a minute. 

GEORGE

Look at that guy. Right there. Isn't that the guy from the show? He's..he's wearing the jacket. 

JERRY

God, you're right. 

GEORGE

(motioning Jerry to follow) C'mon. 

JERRY

Well, I'm a prospective member. 

JERRY

But that guy has my jacket. 

GEORGE

Excuse me, the guy is wearing a jacket that my friend is... 

JERRY

Come on. 

GEORGE

If I could talk to the guy for just a sec... 

BOB

These seats are fantastic. It was really nice of Mr Peterman to give us these tickets. 

ELAINE

(flat) Yeah, yeah. Was nice. 

BOB

(smiling) Yeah. Got our own little private box here, don't we? 

ELAINE

(pushing Bob away) Get offa me! Stop it. Stop it. 

ELAINE

Get offa me! 

ELAINE

Get a hold of yourself, Bob! (throwing Bob back between the seats) Get a hold of yourself! 

JERRY

I dunno how that guy gave us the slip at the Friars Club. 

GEORGE

I told you, he probably went out the back. 

JERRY

Ouf. 

JERRY

Hey. It's you! (pointing) Th..that's my Friars Club jacket! 

JERRY

(adamant) No, no, no. That's my jacket, give it back. 

JERRY

C'mon I need it. 

JERRY

(determined) I wanna join. I need it to become a member. 

GEORGE

Give 'im the jacket already! 

GEORGE

What's he yelling about? They're stealing jackets here! 

JERRY

Can you believe it?! 

JERRY

(examining) Hey George, you know what? I think this crest is different. It's got a moose on it. 

GEORGE

Moose? 

JERRY

Yeah. (subdued) I don't think this is the jacket. 

HALLIE

No, it's not. 

HALLIE

This is the jacket. 

JERRY

Ohh, you got the jacket back. 

GEORGE

Ohh, yeahh. 

JERRY

(taking the jacket) Thank you. 

HALLIE

It got a little dirty, so they wanted to clean it before they gave it back to you. 

JERRY

Oh. (smiling) Oh, that's nice of 'em. 

GEORGE

(smiling) That is really nice. 

HALLIE

Yeah. 

JERRY

Yeah. 

HALLIE

Yeah. 

JERRY

Yeah. 

GEORGE

This is nice. 

JERRY

Yeahh. 

HALLIE

Yeah. 

GEORGE

(forced buoyancy) Hey, you know, let's call Susan, we'll go have coffee. 

HALLIE

(flat) I'll see you at the wedding. 

GEORGE

(moody) Great! Now she's sour! 

JERRY

Maybe she'll sweeten. 

GEORGE

(angry) She won't sweeten, and I'm bitter! 

GEORGE

Here. (panicky) We'll leave it here for you! 

KRAMER

(pointing) That's her, officer. 

CONNIE

(shocked) Kramer! Oh my god, I thought you were... 

KRAMER

(animated) What? Sleeping with the fishes? I guess I woke up! 

DETECTIVE

You're under arrest for the attempted murder of Cosmo Kramer. 

CONNIE

(defensive) I didn't do anything. 

KRAMER

(sarcastic) Oh, yeah! Yeah! 

DETECTIVE

Get your coat, we gotta take you in. 

CONNIE

Can I call my lawyer? 

DETECTIVE

Okay, go ahead. 

CONNIE

(on phone) You gotta meet me at the police station. They're arresting me for attempted murder. 

JACKIE

Attempted murder? Of whom? 

CONNIE

This guy, Kramer. 

JACKIE

Oh. (hesitantly) Cosmo Kramer? 

CONNIE

(surprised) Yeah, that's right. 

JACKIE

(adamant) I don't want nothing to do with it. 

JERRY

I'm looking for a crested blazer 

CRAIG

A crested blazer.. 

JERRY

I've worn one once and I really think it did something for me. 

CRAIG

(turning around): Yes .I Think we may have something. (picks up a blazer) The Joseph Aboud crested blazer is the finest.... That's hand ticking around the crest and these are the world famous Corriso buttons made from the finest Andulo corn. 

JERRY

(softly) Hmm.. they'll match my sneakers. 

CRAIG

It looks fabulous on you... shall I wrap it up? 

JERRY

You know...I'm not sure. I'll tell you what. I'll come back later with someone and see what they think. 

CRAIG

(doubtful) A Hum! 

JERRY

Really I'll be back. 

CRAIG

Yeah! 

JERRY

So I didn't like the crest all that much., but the guy spent fifteen minutes with me so to get out of the store I told I wanted to see what someone else thought.... And then he makes a face like he doesn't believe me. 

ELAINE

Ah! So he knew that you were making it up.! 

JERRY

Yeah..... He caught me So here's what I want you to do. Come back with me to the store and we'll pretend to look at the coat. 

ELAINE

That's ridiculous. Why do do you want to go back there if you don't want the coat? 

JERRY

Because he thinks I was lying and I want to show him I wasn't. 

ELAINE

But you were!! 

JERRY

But if you go back with me , then I'm not. 

JERRY

(to George) Problems with the house guest? 

ELAINE

What house guest? 

GEORGE

This friend of Susan's is staying with us for two weeks...Now am I wrong or is that excessive? 

KRAMER

Well Bob Sacamano he stayed with me once for a year and a half. 

ELAINE

Who is he? 

GEORGE

He's a wig master 

ELAINE

What is a wig master? 

GEORGE

He's with the touring company of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. He's the guy in charge of the wigs. 

JERRY

Boy.. imagine.. liking wigs to the point it becomes a career choice. 

KRAMER

About some tickets George , you know I'd kill for a peek.. 

GEORGE

(leaving) Yeah, Sure, sure ,,, I got to drop my car off at the new lot. 

KRAMER

Euh what...What lot is that? 

GEORGE

Jiffy Park. It's incredible.. Seventy-five dollars a month. 

KRAMER

Seventy -five bucks a month! 

GEORGE

Yeah and you get this really cool T-shirt when you sign on.. 

KRAMER

Oh I'm down. 

JERRY

(proud of himself) Remember me? I said I 'd come back with someone and I did. Surprised?. 

CRAIG

No I believed you. 

JERRY

Yeah.... well Elaine. 

ELAINE

(looking up to the salesman) 

CRAIG

Oh!... hello I'm Craig. 

ELAINE

.....Hi. 

CRAIG

well (picks up the blazer again) here it is. 

ELAINE

Oh!!.....Joseph Aboud .. and look at this hand ticking around the crest. 

CRAIG

You know your coats? 

ELAINE

Well I'm in the biz .. I work for J. Peterman. 

CRAIG

I love J. Peterman. 

ELAINE

(giggling) Ohhh!!. 

CRAIG

I especially enjoy the catalogue, those fanciful narratives really take me away.. 

ELAINE

Ohhh!! really ..well you know what, I write those. 

CRAIG

No!!! 

ELAINE

Yeeeahh!!! 

JERRY

(impatiently cutting in) Hey Elaine What about the crest.? What d'you think of the crest here. 

JERRY

You what?? 

ELAINE

I think it's great. I think you should get it. 

CRAIG

Well .... Will it be check or credit card? 

JERRY

(giving up) Check. 

CRAIG

I'll need you to write down your phone number on the check for me. (turning to Elaine) Perhaps you could do the same. 

ELAINE

(laughs and giggles like a schoolgirl) 

JERRY

You weren't supposed to say that. 

ELAINE

But I really did like it 

JERRY

That's not the point. You put me in a position where I had no choice. 

ELAINE

uhn... Sorry! 

JERRY

And what about that guy asking you out right in front of me? 

ELAINE

What is the big deal!! 

JERRY

...'s very emasculating, he doesn't know the nature of our relationship. You're there approving new clothes.....That's a girlfriend job! How dare he!! 

ELAINE

He dared.... 

ETHAN

(sitting in the couch and combing his wigs)Hi George.. How was your day? 

GEORGE

Good....good day (not too convincing) You? 

ETHAN

I am getting so much work done..... See? 

GEORGE

Very nice 

SUSAN

(walks in) Hi sweety How was your day? 

ETHAN

I already ask him that. He said Good...Good day.... 

KRAMER

(frantically pulling at his doorknob) Thank god you're home. I'm wiped out. I drop my car at Jiffy Park and I forgot to take my apartment keys off the ring. So you got my spare? 

JERRY

ATTENDANT

SUSAN

GEORGE

Hi honey.. 

SUSAN

..So you're telling me the truth? 

GEORGE

Of Course I'm telling the truth. 

SUSAN

Because I have to be able to trust you... If I can't trust you then there's no way that this can work. 

GEORGE

Really! 

SUSAN

Yeah. 

GEORGE

Well then...then you really have something to think about because.....you know if there's any doubt in your mind ....and.. and,, it doesn't even have to be a big doubt, you know even a tiny doubt, a DOT of a doubt.. and..... 

SUSAN

There's no doubt. 

GEORGE

Because if there's any doubt at all I...I feel we should cultivate it. 

SUSAN

Cultivate it? 

GEORGE

Yes, you know. Deal with it .We have to deal with the doubt, Susan The DOUBT!! Must be dealt with. 

SUSAN

I have no doubt George. Do you? 

GEORGE

(hesitates) ...Nooooooooooo... 

ELAINE

You know... I can't wait to get that dress.. 

CRAIG

CRAIG

Yes! From Milan.

CRAIG

(Interrupts) Eeen!!! 

IAN

Hey Craig. 

CRAIG

ELAINE

Hi E-an 

IAN

ELAINE

Bye Eeeen. 

ELAINE

So you're giving him a discount too? 

CRAIG

Hummm Why so surprised? 

ELAINE

Hem!! No reason. 

JERRY

You know that clothing salesman had a lot of nerve hitting on Elaine right in front of me. He stands to make a big commission too on that jacket with the crest that nobody seems to like. You know what I'm gonna do.? I'm gonna take that jacket back.. I'm putting this guy ....RIGHT OUT OF COMMISSION.... 

KRAMER

Heeeeeummmrph.... I'm gonna turn in 

JERRY

Turn in? 

KRAMER

Yeah,I had a tough day 

JERRY

It's only nine o clock. 

KRAMER

Well ..I don't argue with the body Jerry. It's an argument you can't win. 

JERRY

I can't go to sleep at nine o clock! 

KRAMER

Well you can go to your room and read. 

JERRY

Hey look ,you know, you're the one who's locked out. I'm letting you stay here. You're wearing my bathrobe. You should adapt to me. 

KRAMER

But I'm tired.. 

JERRY

Oh why don't you go sleep over at Newman's. 

KRAMER

Aah! He's got a girl up there. This quilt is too thin...I know I'm gonna get cold. I don't even fit on this couch. Don't even know if I'm gonna sleep.... 

JERRY

Well that's all I got. 

KRAMER

Can I sleep with you? 

JERRY

Huh? 

KRAMER

Well you got that big comfortable bed and that nice warm quilt. 

JERRY

Kramer , there's no way you're sleeping with me. 

KRAMER

Why? 

JERRY

Why? 

KRAMER

Yeah! 

JERRY

Do I really have to explain why? 

KRAMER

Well I......( Elaine pops in at that moment) 

ELAINE

Hi!. 

KRAMER

Hi...........What's that? 

ELAINE

Squire's walking stick. I had to write about it for the catalogue. 

KRAMER

Wow. 

ELAINE

You want it? 

KRAMER

Yeaaahmm.... 

ELAINE

You can have ,I don't need it anymore. 

KRAMER

Ooh Mama...( walks away) 

ELAINE

Ok so ..I am positive you are wrong about Craig. 

JERRY

Yeah Why? 

ELAINE

Because he told a man he'd give him a discount too... a man Jerry. 

JERRY

So ,Who is he? 

ELAINE

Some friend of his from England. 

JERRY

Don't you see?...........It's all a big scam. 

ELAINE

You're nuts! 

KRAMER

How do you know he's not wondering the same thing about you? 

ELAINE

What d'you mean? 

KRAMER

What do I mean?.. Well perhaps he thinks that you're working him for the discount. Shaking that little butt of yours into big, big savings.... And then when you get it,you know, you drop him like a hot potato. 

ELAINE

Aawwh Please..... 

KRAMER

Now see the two of you need to work on trust... and then and only then will there be a free exchange of sex and discounts.. Cornerstones of a healthy relationship....and now if you would (taps twice on the door) excuse us. We need to get to bed. 

KRAMER

(softly)hmmm....patio furniture's on sale. 

GEORGE

Excuse me...huh... I think I made a big mistake. I'd like my deposit back please. 

ATTENDANT

Whats the problem 

GEORGE

You got hookers turning tricks in my car. How's that for starters. 

ATTENDANT

Haaan! That is all hearsay. 

GEORGE

Allright, very good I'd like my car and my deposit back please 

ATTENDANT

Can't do it' 

GEORGE

Whadday'mean.? 

ATTENDANT

If you read the agreement you signed the deposit is not refundable. 

GEORGE

Well does it say anywhere in the contract about my car being used as a whorehouse? 'Cause I don't remember reading that clause either.. 

ATTENDANT

What can I tell you buddy. Take it up with Consumer Affairs. 

ATTENDANT

Well that's going to be a problem 

GEORGE

Why? 

ATTENDANT

It's all the way in the back. Can't get it out for a couple of days. 

GEORGE

What are you talking about.. I WANT MY CAR!! 

ATTENDANT

We ask that you please bear with us. 

GEORGE

Bear with you! This is a parking lot PEOPLE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO GET 

ATTENDANT

Ideally.. 

JERRY

Excuse me I'd like to return this jacket. 

TELLER

Certainly. May I ask why? 

JERRY

........For spite... 

TELLER

Spite? 

JERRY

That's right. I don't care for the salesman that sold it to me. 

TELLER

I don't think you can return an item for spite. 

JERRY

What do you mean? 

TELLER

Well if there was some problem with the garment. If it were unsatisfactory in some way, then we could do it for you, but I'm afraid spite doesn't fit into any of our conditions for a refund 

JERRY

That's ridiculous, I want to return it. What's the difference what the reason is. 

TELLER

Let me speak with the manager...excuse me .............Bob! 

TELLER

........spite.....(Manager walks over) 

BOB

What seems to be the problem? 

JERRY

Well I want to return this jacket and she asked me why and I said for spite and now she won't take it back. 

BOB

That's true. You can't return an item based purely on spite. 

BOB

Well you already said spite so...... 

JERRY

But I changed my mind.. 

BOB

No...you said spite...Too late. 

KRAMER

It's Halloween (not sure) 

CHARMAINE

Get a calendar honey! It's the 90's

ELAINE

Huh! 

CRAIG

ELAINE

Hummm.... so you've no idea when.. they'll arrive. 

CRAIG

ETHAN

How can she go with a guy like that , he's a mess... I just don't see them together at all

JERRY

(Interrupts) Excuse me...Excuse me... Are you asking him out ? 

JESSIE

Yeah...I guess you could say that.. 

JERRY

Right in front of me!. How do you know we're not together. Two guys, sittin' laughin' drinking Champagne Coolies. 

JESSIE

I dunno I just didn't think you were. 

JERRY

Well we're sitting here together. Why wouldn't you think that. 

JESSIE

I dont know. I just didn't. 

JERRY

Well it's very emasculating.. 

ELAINE

Hello. 

ELAINE

Uhmmm huh! Is it important.? 

BOB

Well..... 

ELAINE

Let me ask you something. ahemm..Do you know when the Nicole Millers are coming in from Milan?. 

BOB

Nicole Millers, We're not expecting any Nicole Millers, in fact we have too many as it is. 

ELAINE

Well do you have any in a... size four.? 

BOB

Yes several.. Just tell him he doesn't have to be in tomorrow before Eleven. 

ELAINE

(sarcastically) Oh! yeah I'll make sure he gets the message. (looks at the sleeping Craig and thinks) They make wigs out of human hair? (still thinking, Ethan's voice) And pay plenty for them. 

KRAMER

(looks inside the car and gasps) Ohhh Sweet Maria. Hey! lets go. 

KRAMER

Hey What are you doing in my car? Hey!Hey!Hey! Where you going. 

HOOKER

KRAMER

POLICE

Policer officer. Freeze right there. 

POLICE

OK Big Daddy. Take the hat off...... awright turn to your right...(Kramer hesitates) I SAID TURN PIMP. 

KRAMER

(cries) I'M NOT A PIMP.!!!. 

GEORGE

I believe the doors on the bathroom stalls, here at the stadium, don't offer much by way of privacy. But I was thinking if we extend the doors all the way to the floors...... 

STEINBRENNER

All the way to the floor! What are you crazy! You'd suffocate in there. Your lucky you have any doors at all. You know when I was in the army...... Hey Costanza. What's that your eating over there? It looks pretty tasty. 

GEORGE

It's a calzone, sir. 

STEINBRENNER

A calzone huh. Pass it down here. Let's have a look at at it. I want a little taste. Come on, come on. Pass it down here. That's a good boy. Okay. What's in this thing? 

GEORGE

Uh. Cheese, pepperoni, eggplant. 

STEINBRENNER

Eggplant. Yes. That's a hell of a thing. Okay let's get back to business. Okay here you go. Very good, very good. Excellent. excellent calzone you got there Costanza. Okay a little jealous now. Okay lets go. Ok last week....... You know that eggplant was very good. Everybody out. I got eggplant on my mind. Costanza get me couple of those calzones right now. Pronto. Move out. Pigstein what's an eggplant calzone. Must have one. Everybody out. Out. 

ELAINE

One of those fabric wholesalers. This guy Todd Gack. I won a bet from him. 

JERRY

What bet? 

ELAINE

He bet me Dustin Hoffman was in Star Wars. 

JERRY

Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars!?! Short Jewish guy against Darth Vader. I don't think so. 

ELAINE

That's what I said. 

JERRY

So the bet was that the loser has to buy dinner? 

ELAINE

Yeah. 

JERRY

Huh. 

ELAINE

What? 

JERRY

No. nothing. 

JERRY

What's with you? 

KRAMER

Feel this. 

JERRY

Wow.That's hot. 

KRAMER

Yeah. It's piquing hot. It's fresh out of the dryer. Hey Elaine you have to feel my pants. 

ELAINE

I'll see you later. 

KRAMER

Oh. All right. You don't know what your missing. I'm loving this Jerry. I am never putting on another piece of clothing unless it's straight out of the dryer. 

JERRY

So know every time you get dressed. You are going to go down to the basement and use the dryer. 

KRAMER

Oh yeah. It's a warm and wonderful feeling, Jerry. So what are you doing later? 

JERRY

I got a date with Nikki. 

KRAMER

Oh yeah she's a beauty. 

JERRY

She's also quite bold. 

KRAMER

Oh bold and beautiful. 

STEINBRENNER

I am loving this calzone. The pita pocket prevents it from dripping. The pita pocket. (phone rings)What is it Watson? A lost and found. No. I don't think we need that. If people keel over because they lost something that's there tough luck. You got a drip on your mouth by the way. 

GEORGE

You know a lost and found could be a good idea. 

STEINBRENNER

Hold on Watson. You like lost and found George? 

GEORGE

Definitely. 

STEINBRENNER

All right lost and found. But these got to be a time limit. We're not running a pawn shop here. 

JERRY

Hey, Elaine. 

ELAINE

Hi Jerry! 

JERRY

This is Nikki. 

NIKKI

Hi! 

ELAINE

Hello. This is Todd Gack. 

JERRY

Oh of course. Todd Gack. You did you bet was in Star Wars? Sammy Davis Jr. 

ELAINE

So what movie are you guys seeing? 

ELAINE

Oh. We were going to see that but it was sold out. So were going to see'Blame it on the Rain' 

JERRY

Why don't you see what you can do? 

NIKKI

Okay. 

ELAINE

What's she going to do? There's no more tickets. 

JERRY

We'll see. 

TODD

Hey Jerry. Do you like cigars? 

JERRY

Yeah. Why? 

TODD

I am going to Montreal tomorrow and they sell them dirt cheap. 

JERRY

Hey,that might be a nice idea for George's wedding. 

TODD

So do you want a box? 

JERRY

Sure. If there cheap Why not. 

TODD

All right I buy a box and give to Elaine. 

NIKKI

Okay two tickets'Means to an End' 

JERRY

Told you. 

ELAINE

How did you do that? 

NIKKI

I just talked to the manager. 

JERRY

All right. Enjoy'Blame it on the Rain' 

GEORGE

There putting in a lost and found because of me. There's a time limit but still. 

JERRY

There really building a Utopian society up there huh.And you tribute all this to the calzone. 

GEORGE

Yeah. I am like a drug dealer. I got the guy hooked. I am having lunch at his desk everyday this week. He doesn't make a move without me. It's very exciting. 

JERRY

With you two guys at the helm. The last piece of the puzzle is in place. 

GEORGE

So let me ask you a question about the tip jar. I had a little thing with the calzone guy this week. I go to drop a buck in the tip jar and just as I am about to drop it in he looks the other way. And then when I am leaving he gives me this look think thanks for nothing. I mean if they don't notice it what's the point. 

JERRY

So you don't make it a habit of giving to the blind. 

GEORGE

Not bills. 

JERRY

So George. Remember when I told you Nikki gets whatever she wants. We are at the movies last night. It's sold out. Nikki goes and talks to the manager. Right in. 

GEORGE

Beautiful women. You know they could get away with murder. You never she any of them lift anything over three pounds. They get whatever they want whenever they want it. You can't stop them. 

JERRY

She's like a beautiful Godzilla. 

GEORGE

Without thousands of fleeing Japanese. 

KRAMER

Hey buddy. 

JERRY

What the hell is all this? 

KRAMER

I am looking for quarters for the dryer. 

JERRY

Why can't you do this on your table? 

KRAMER

Because I don't have a table. 

ELAINE

Hey. 

JERRY

Hey. So how was'Blame it on the Rain?' 

ELAINE

Huh. Yeah thanks for getting us tickets too. 

JERRY

Oh!! Let me ask you a question. Was the movie part of the bet? 

ELAINE

No. We were both in the mood for one. 

JERRY

You know Elaine, It is not my way to intrude on the personal lives of close fiends.... 

ELAINE

Oh is that so. 

JERRY

Absolutely. But I feel I must inform you that what happened last night was more than a simple bet. 

ELAINE

What are you talking about? 

JERRY

Come on. Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars. He made a bet he knew he was going to lose just to take you to dinner 

ELAINE

If he wanted to ask me out why didn't he just ask me. 

JERRY

Because if he doesn't ask you out he doesn't get rejected. He has found a dating loop hole. 

ELAINE

I don't buy it. 

JERRY

So what happened after the movie? 

ELAINE

Nothing. He walked me home. 

JERRY

To the door? 

ELAINE

Yeah. 

JERRY

That's a date. 

ELAINE

No it's not. 

JERRY

But I never walk you home. 

ELAINE

That's just because your a jackass. 

KRAMER

Ah!! I found a quarter. Anybody want there clothes heated up? 

JERRY

No, no. 

ELAINE

No, no. 

JERRY

So how did you leave it with him? 

ELAINE

I am supposed to meet him to pick up your cigars. 

JERRY

That's another loop hole. That's two dates without asking you out. 

ELAINE

Your crazy! 

JERRY

Crazy like a man. 

WORKER

Number 49. 

GEORGE

You know my last name is Costanza. That's Italian. So you and I are like country men. Pisano's! 

WORKER

$ 6.50 your change. 

GEORGE

And I always take care of my Pisano's. So here is a little something. (drop in tip and worker looks the other way, so George decides to take it out and try again only to get caught) 

WORKER

Hey! You steal my money!! 

GEORGE

No no. That's not what I was trying to do. 

WORKER

I know what you try to do. Get out. Don't ever come back ever. 

GEORGE

I got your calzones Mr. Steinbrenner. 

STEINBRENNER

Beautiful. I am starving George. 

GEORGE

I thought tomorrow maybe we'd try a little corn beef. 

STEINBRENNER

Corn beef. I don't think so. It is a little fatty. 

GEORGE

How about Chinese? 

STEINBRENNER

Uhhhhh. No. Too many containers. Big mess, big mess. Too sloppy.I want to stick with the calzones from Pisano's. That's the ticket. 

GEORGE

I just thought it would be nice. A little variety. 

STEINBRENNER

No, no, no. George let me tell you something. When I find something I like I stick with it. From 1973 to 1982 I ate the exact same lunch everyday. Turkey chili in a bowl made out of bread. Bread bowl George. First you eat the chili then you eat the bowl. There's nothing more satisfying than looking down after lunch and seeing nothing but a table. 

ELAINE

Thanks for the dinner. 

TODD

Well I had to give these cigars and we were both hungry. 

ELAINE

Hey Todd. Let me ask you a question. Um. Was this whole date thing just a way of asking me out? 

TODD

What? 

ELAINE

I mean Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars? 

TODD

Elaine that was a legitimate bet and I lost so I bought you dinner. 

ELAINE

Oh all right. Okay well, goodnight. 

TODD

Hey, if your not doing anything Saturday do you want to meet somewhere? 

ELAINE

See what is that? Is that a date? 

TODD

Why can't two people go and do something without it being a date? 

ELAINE

All right. I am sorry it's not a date. 

TODD

No way. So I'll see you Saturday night? 

ELAINE

All right. 

TODD

Pick you up at 8:00 p.m. 

OFFICER

Do you know what the posted speed limit on this road is? 

JERRY

I was got to be 55. 

OFFICER

That's right it is. Do you know how fast you were going? 

JERRY

A lot faster than that! 

OFFICER

Step out of the car sir. 

JERRY

Okay dokey 

OFFICER

Can I have your license and registration please? 

JERRY

Absolutely. Nikki! 

NIKKI

Yes. 

JERRY

Would you mind bringing the officer the registration? 

NIKKI

Not at all. 

OFFICER

I got you on the radar at 93 miles per hour. 

JERRY

You must have gotten me when I slowed down to take that curve because for a while there I was doing well over 100. 

NIKKI

Officer. Hi. Do you really have to give us a ticket? 

JERRY

All right Nik. That's it. 

KRAMER

Hey buddy. I am waiting for my shirt. 

JERRY

You got your shirt in my oven!?! 

KRAMER

I didn't have any quarters for the dryer. Anyway this is better. And it's more convenient. 

JERRY

For both of us. 

KRAMER

And I have a lot more control. I have one shirt going for 10 minutes at 325 degrees. 

JERRY

What's wrong with your oven? 

KRAMER

I am baking a pie! 

JERRY

Yeah. 

GEORGE

Yeah. 

JERRY

Come on up. 

KRAMER

You got cigars, huh. 

JERRY

I got some Cubans for George's wedding. They were more than I wanted to pay for but what the hell! 

KRAMER

Oh yeah baby. spit, spit. What are these?'Perducto de Peru'Jerry, if you think these are Cubans you have another thing coming. 

JERRY

Peru! I paid $300 bucks for these. I could have bought a house in Peru for $300 bucks! 

KRAMER

You got ripped buddy. 

JERRY

I got to pay this Todd Gack guy $300 bucks just so he has some excuse to see Elaine again without asking her out. 

KRAMER

That's a nice name. Todd Gack. Is that Dutch? (Dingggggg) Oh baby. Here we go. Uh momma.(putting his fresh out of the oven shirt on) Hey George hey. 

GEORGE

Well this is bad. I am really in a bad situation now. 

JERRY

so what is Steinbrenner going to do if he doesn't get his calzones? 

GEORGE

What's he going to do? That's exactly the point. Nobody knows what this guy is capable of! He fires people like it is a bodily function. 

JERRY

Why don't you get someone else from the office to go get Pisano's for you? 

GEORGE

Because before you know it he'll be having lunch with him. You know how these interoffice politics work. 

JERRY

No. I never had a job. 

KRAMER

I decided to go with the brown one 's. (pants) 

GEORGE

What the hell is this? 

JERRY

Kramer's cooking up some corduroy. 

GEORGE

There has got to be some way to get back into Pisano's. 

KRAMER

Pisano's. That's the place by the stadium right? 

GEORGE

Yeah. You've heard of it? 

KRAMER

Yeah. Newman raves about it. It's on his mail route. He goes by there everyday. 

GEORGE

I'll see you guys later. 

JERRY

What kind of pie are you cooking? 

KRAMER

Huckleberry. 

NEWMAN

You certainly are in a bind. 

GEORGE

Yeah. And since you go buy there everyday. I was hoping that we could help each other out. 

NEWMAN

Oh well. Let me perfectly blunt. I don't care for you Costanza. You hang out at the west side of the building with Seinfeld all day and just it up wasting your lives. 

GEORGE

Are you going to help me or not? 

NEWMAN

All right, all right. I'll help you but I will except something in return. 

GEORGE

What? 

NEWMAN

Well for starters I want a calzone of my own..... 

GEORGE

All right. 

NEWMAN

And a slice of pepperoni pizza and a large soda and three times a week I will require a canolie. 

GEORGE

That's a little steep don't you think? 

NEWMAN

You know I hear Mr. Steinbrenner can be a bit erratic. I would hate to see him when he's hungry. 

GEORGE

All right, all right. 

NEWMAN

Do we have a deal? 

GEORGE

But I have to have them by one o'clock. He's very regiment about his meals. 

NEWMAN

I know exactly how he feels. Pleasure doing business with you. Do come again. Ha, ha, ha, ha. 

ELAINE

This is nice. 

TODD

Gack. Party of four. 

ELAINE

Party of four? Who are we meeting? 

TODD

Mom! Dad! This is Elaine. 

MOM

Hello. 

ELAINE

Hellllllooooo. 

MOM

Nice meeting you. 

TODD

Bye mom. 

MOM

She's wonderful. 

ELAINE

What the hell was that? 

TODD

What? 

ELAINE

Why did you introduce me to your parents? 

TODD

There nice people. I thought you would like them. 

ELAINE

Come on Todd. Admit it, this is a date. 

TODD

Why is this a date? 

ELAINE

Saturday night with your parents. Unless I'm your sister this is a date. 

TODD

Elaine. I don't understand why you can't meet someone else's parents without classifying it as a date. 

ELAINE

Well if it's not a date then what is it? 

TODD

It's a lovely evening together. 

ELAINE

I don't believe this. 

TODD

Well I am getting a cab want to join me? 

ELAINE

No. I'll just walk home. 

TODD

Okay goodnight. (goes to kiss her) 

ELAINE

Now what was that? 

NEWMAN

Hello. What 's this? 

GEORGE

Well I was dropping of the calzone money for the week.... Um shouldn't you be at work by now? 

NEWMAN

Work? It's raining. 

GEORGE

Soooooo 

NEWMAN

I called in sick. I don't work in the rain. 

GEORGE

You don't work in the rain? Your a mailman.'Neither rain nor sleet nor snow.....'It's the first one. 

NEWMAN

I was never that big on creeds. 

GEORGE

You were supposed to deliver my calzones. We had a deal! 

NEWMAN

I believe the deal was that I get the calzones on my mail route. Well today I won't be going on my mail route! Will I. Perhaps tomorrow. 

GEORGE

But I'm paying you! 

NEWMAN

Yes thank you. (slams door) 

GEORGE

Newman!! 

NIKKI

Peru? I thought you wanted cigars from Cuba? 

JERRY

I did. 

NIKKI

Well if these aren't what you wanted then why did you pay him? 

JERRY

Well what could I do? Unless you pay him a visit. 

NIKKI

Okay. 

GEORGE

Kramer! 

KRAMER

Hey you! 

GEORGE

Look I need you to do me a favor. I need you to get me lunch at Pisano's. 

KRAMER

What happened to Newman? 

GEORGE

He called in sick. 

KRAMER

Oh yeah right it's raining. 

GEORGE

Can you do it? 

KRAMER

What time do you need it at? 

GEORGE

1:00 p.m. Do you need any money? 

KRAMER

No. I got eight tons of change. I'm loaded. 

KRAMER

Hey hold that bus! 

KRAMER

Hey. It's really wet out there. 

WORKER

What can I get you? 

KRAMER

I here you make a pretty mean calzone. 

WORKER

Calzone! 

KRAMER

Yeah calzone. 

WORKER

The best! 

KRAMER

All right. Lay them on me. I'll take three. 

WORKER

Three calzones. 

KRAMER

Hey. That's a big oven. Huh. Listen. I was wondering if you could do me a favor. 

ELAINE

Hey Todd. 

TODD

Hi. You know Nikki. 

ELAINE

Yeah sure. 

NIKKI

Wait. Elaine will settle this. What's the'M'stand for in Richard M. Nixon? 

ELAINE

Milhouse. 

NIKKI

I told you so. He said it was Moe. You owe me a dinner. 

WORKER

Your order is ready. Three calzones and one shirt and jacket. 

KRAMER

Oh. This is all burned up. Look at this. 

WORKER

What the hell do I know about cooking a shirt? What the hell is this? Your paying in pennies? 

KRAMER

That's all I got. 

WORKER

No. You have to have bills. Paper money. You can't pay with this. 

KRAMER

I told you this is all I got. 

WORKER

Then no calzones. 

GEORGE

What happened? Where have you been? 

KRAMER

The guy wouldn't give them to me because I wanted to pay in change. 

GEORGE

What the hell happened to your shirt? 

KRAMER

He overcooked it. It's ruined. 

GEORGE

Your clothes smell just like Pisano's. There's another Italian place on Jerome. Maybe I can fool him. 

STEINBRENNER

(on phone) That's right. Do you want to say it again. I'll say it again. I hadn't had a pimple since I was eighteen and I don't care that you don't believe me or not. And how's this. Your fired. Okay your not. I am just a little hungry. Where's Costanza with my calzone. It's 1:15. He's late. That smell. I have to call you back. Costanza. He's in the building. Costanza is in the building and he's not in this office. Costanza! I'll get you. 

JERRY

Stupid cigars. You know if I didn't send Nikki over to talk to him they wouldn't be together. 

ELAINE

These are terrible. 

JERRY

It's like trying to smoke a chicken bone. 

ELAINE

What kind of a name is Todd Gack anyway. 

JERRY

I think it's Dutch. I got to get going. 

ELAINE

Where are you going? 

JERRY

I... uh....promised Nikki that I'd walk her dog for her. 

ELAINE

But she broke up with you. 

JERRY

I know, I know. But some how she explained it to me and I couldn't say no. 

ELAINE

It smells like a rubber fire. 

ELAINE

I said rubber fire. 

JERRY

Oh. 

ELAINE

Did you ever pay Todd for these things? 

JERRY

Actually it's being taken care of right now. 

KRAMER

You Gack? 

TODD

Yeah. 

KRAMER

Here's your money. 

STEINBRENNER

George. Why do these clothes smell like Pisano's? 

GEORGE

Because they were heated up there. 

STEINBRENNER

Heating up your clothes? That's not a bad idea. 

NOTE

Originally broadcast as part of a 60 min episode, with The Bottle Deposit (2) 

WILHELM

And you can tell the players that I reimburse the trainer for the cigarettes and the dive checks. 

GEORGE

Sorry, the players will be reimbursed? 

WILHELM

The trainer, George. Tell the players I'll reimburse the trainer. What's the matter with you? This is the third time I've had to repeat myself. 

GEORGE

Sorry, Mr Wilhelm. 

WILHELM

Look, sorry doesn't cut it. We're running a ball club here George. You've got to pay attention. 

GEORGE

I know, sir. It won't happen again. 

WILHELM

Lemme see, I uh, I had an assignment for you... uh. 

WILHELM

Lemme think here. 

PETERMAN

Elaine. 

ELAINE

Hi, Mr Peterman. 

PETERMAN

You know what a huge fan I am of John F Kennedy. 

ELAINE

I do. 

PETERMAN

It was the Peace Corps that gave me my start in this business. (nostalgic) Clothing the naked natives of Bantu Besh. 

ELAINE

The pygmy pullover. 

PETERMAN

Sotheby's is having an auction of JFK's memorabilia. One item in particular has caught my eye. The presidential golf clubs. To me, they capture that indefinable romance that was Camelot. 

ELAINE

Whatever. 

PETERMAN

But, unfortunately I will be out of town with my lady-friend and therefore unable to bid on the lot. I was hoping maybe you would go in my stead. 

ELAINE

Oh. (pleasant surprise) Oh yeah, I'd be happy to. Uhm, how much d'you want this thing? (smilingly) I mean, you know, how high are you willing to go? 

PETERMAN

I would see no trouble in spending up to, say, ten thousand dollars. Have my secretary give you a signed cheque. 

ELAINE

Wow. 

WILHELM

...when you're done George, and bring it directly to me. Mr Steinbrenner is very interested in this. 

GEORGE

Yes, sir. 

WILHELM

(drying his hands and heading for the door) Yes, George. I want you to make this project a top priority. 

GEORGE

I will, sir. Top priority. 

WILHELM

(exiting) Top priority. 

GEORGE

Top priority. 

GEORGE

So he walks out of the stall, he's been talking the whole time. 

JERRY

He pulled an LBJ on you. 

GEORGE

LBJ? 

JERRY

Lyndon Johnson, used to do that to his staffers. 

GEORGE

No kidding? 

JERRY

Oh yeah. He'd hold national security meetings in there. He planned the Hanoi bombing after a bad Thai meal. 

GEORGE

Well, I still don't know what I'm supposed to do. I don't even know what my assignment is. 

JERRY

Ask him to repeat it. Tell him there was an echo in there. 

GEORGE

I can't. He's been on my case about not paying attention. Besides, it's too late, I already told him I heard him. 

JERRY

You know what you do? Ask him a follow-up question. Tell him you're having trouble getting started, and you want his advice. 

GEORGE

Yeah, follow-up question, that'll work. 

KRAMER

Hey buddy. 

JERRY

Hey. 

GEORGE

Hey. 

JERRY

Can I have my keys... 

KRAMER

(tossing car keys to Jerry) Yeah. 

JERRY

(catching keys) ...back, please? 

KRAMER

You shoulda come, Jerry. 

NEWMAN

We made quite a haul. 

GEORGE

Where'd you go? 

KRAMER

Price club. 

GEORGE

Why didn't you take your car? 

KRAMER

Ah, the steering wheel fell off. I don't know where it is. 

KRAMER

What're you doing. (fetching the bottle from the trash) Don't throw that away. 

NEWMAN

Well, I'm not paying the five cents for that stupid recycling thing. 

KRAMER

You don't pay five cents, you get five cents back. Here, read the label here. (reads from bottle) Vermont, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York. Refund, (brings bottle up close to Newman's eyes) vrrup, five cents. 

NEWMAN

(taking bottle) Refund? 

KRAMER

Yes. 

JERRY

Well, what d'you think the hoboes are doing? 

NEWMAN

I don't know, they're deranged. 

GEORGE

Awright, listen, can you uh, gimme a lift back to my place? 

JERRY

No I can't. I gotta pick up Elaine. I'm taking her to this Kennedy auction. 

GEORGE

Awright, I'll see you later. 

NEWMAN

(peering at bottle label) What is this 'MI, ten cents'? 

KRAMER

That's Michigan. In Michigan you get ten cents. 

NEWMAN

Ten cents!? 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

NEWMAN

Wait a minute. You mean you get five cents here, and ten cents there. You could round up bottles here and run 'em out to Michigan for the difference. 

KRAMER

No, it doesn't work. 

NEWMAN

What d'you mean it doesn't work? You get enough bottles together... 

KRAMER

Yeah, you overload your inventory and you blow your margins on gasoline. Trust me, it doesn't work. 

JERRY

(re-entering) Hey, you're not talking that Michigan deposit bottle scam again, are you? 

KRAMER

No, no, I'm off that. 

NEWMAN

You tried it? 

KRAMER

Oh yeah. Every which way. Couldn't crunch the numbers. It drove me crazy. 

JERRY

(leaving) You two keep an eye on each other? 

KRAMER

(simultaneous) No problem. You bet. 

JERRY

Are you sure you didn't hear my car making a funny noise? I know those two idiots did something to it. 

ELAINE

No, I didn't hear anything. (she spots a familiar face) Oh, my God, look who's here. 

JERRY

Sue Ellen Mishke, the braless 'O Henry' candy bar heiress. 

ELLEN

Well. Hello Elaine. Jerry. 

ELAINE

Hi Sue Ellen. 

JERRY

Hi Sue Ellen. 

ELLEN

I'm surprised to see you here. Come to catch a glimpse of high society? 

ELAINE

(faked laughter) Oh, ho ha ha. No, no, I'm actually here to bid, Sue Ellen. I mean that is if anything is to my liking. 

JERRY

I'm here to catch a glimpse... of high society. 

ELLEN

Well, I hope you find something that fits your budget. 

ELAINE

(half under her breath and half to Jerry) I... hate that woman. 

NEWMAN

I don't understand. You fill an eighteen-wheeler? 

KRAMER

No, an eighteen-wheeler's no good. Too much overhead. You got permits, weigh-stations, tolls... Look, you're way outta your league. 

NEWMAN

I wanna learn. I want to know why. 

ELAINE

(loudly, for the benefit of Sue-Ellen) Oh. Those are handsome. Look at that set. Yeah, think I might bid on those. 

AUCTIONEER

Lot number seven forty-five. We have a full set of golf clubs, that were owned by President John F Kennedy, as seen in the famous photograph of the president chipping at Burning Tree on the morning of the Bay of Pigs invasion. The set in perfect condition, and we will start the bidding at four thousand dollars. Four thousand dollars? Do I have four thousand dollars? 

AUCTIONEER

I have four thousand dollars. Do I have five? (another person bids) Five thousand dollars. I have five thousand dollars. Do I have six? Six thousand dollars for this set of beautiful clubs. (another bid) Six. I have six thousand dollars. Can I have sixty-five hundred? 

AUCTIONEER

Sixty-five hundred to the dark-haired person on the right. We are at sixty-five hundred, do I hear sixty-six hundred? 

AUCTIONEER

The president's own golf clubs. Leisure life at Camelot. Sixty-five hundred going once... 

ELLEN

Eight thousand. 

AUCTIONEER

Eight thousand. We have eight thousand. The bid is now eight thousand dollars. 

ELAINE

(to Jerry) What is she doing? She's starting in on the bidding now? (to Auctioneer) Eighty-five hundred! 

AUCTIONEER

We have eighty-five... 

ELLEN

Nine thousand. 

AUCTIONEER

Nine thousand dollars. 

JERRY

Think she wants those clubs. 

AUCTIONEER

Do I hear ninety-five? Ninety-five hundred... 

ELAINE

Ninety-five hundred. 

ELLEN

Ten thousand. 

AUCTIONEER

Ten thousand, to the shapely woman on the left. Ten thousand going once... 

JERRY

Well, that's your ceiling. 

AUCTIONEER

Ten thousand going twice... 

ELAINE

(determined) Eleven thousand! 

ELLEN

Twelve thousand. 

ELAINE

(angrier) Thirteen thousand! 

ELLEN

Fourteen thousand. 

ELAINE

(vicious) Fifteen thousand!! 

ELAINE

Peterman is gonna kill me. 

JERRY

I really thought you had her there at seventeen thousand. 

ELAINE

Why didn't you stop me? 

JERRY

Do you hear this clunking? 

ELAINE

(listening) A little. 

ELAINE

Oh. You know what? (indicates clubs) I'm gonna grab these from you later. You'll take care of 'em, okay? Okay. See you tomorrow. 

JERRY

Okay. 

ELAINE

Alrighty, bye. 

JERRY

Bye. 

JERRY

What's going on here? 

JERRY

Oh God! 

JERRY

(angry) Oh, you idiots! 

NEWMAN

So we could put the bottles in a U-haul. You know, go lean and mean? 

KRAMER

Newman, it's a dead-end, c'mon. (Jerry enters) Hey, there he is. 

JERRY

Hey. You put your groceries under the hood of my car? 

KRAMER

(to Newman) Aw, that's right, we forgot about those. 

NEWMAN

(to Kramer) That's where my missing soda is. 

JERRY

And your crab legs, and a thing of cheese. The Triple-A guy said I was this close to sucking a muffin down the carburetor. What were you thinking? 

KRAMER

We ran outta space. 

JERRY

Now I gotta take the car down to Tony and get it checked out. 

KRAMER

Ah, Tony, he's good. 

JERRY

Yeah, he's real good. But he's so obsessive about the car. He makes me feel guilty about every little thing that's wrong with it. I gotta get it washed before I bring it down to him, or I'm afraid he'll yell at me. 

KRAMER

(offering the artichoke can) 'Choke?' 

JERRY

No, thank you. 

TONY

(lovingly) Oh, yeah. I remember this car. Beautiful car. 

JERRY

Yeah. So, anyway, the engine's been idling a little rough. I thought it might be time for a check up... 

JERRY

There's really nothing wrong on the inside. 

TONY

Well, the shift knob is loose. You know about that? 

JERRY

No, I hadn't noticed. 

TONY

(accusingly) Have you been picking at it? 

JERRY

Have I been picking at it? No. You know. It's just wear and tear. 

TONY

(disapprovingly) Wear and tear. I see. 

JERRY

The engine is really the only thing that needs checking. 

TONY

You been rotating the tires? 

JERRY

Try to. 

TONY

(sharp) You don't try to. You do it! Fifty-one percent of all turns are right turns. You know that? 'Try to.' 

PETERMAN

Twenty thousand dollars!?! Elaine, that's twice the amount I authorised you to spend. 

ELAINE

I know, Mr Peterman, but but but but once I saw them, I just couldn't stand to let anyone else have them. (warming to her subject) You know, certainly not some stuck-up candy bar heiress who shamelessly flaunts herself in public without any regard... 

PETERMAN

Well, where are they? 

ELAINE

(ingratiatingly) They should be here today. 

GEORGE

Uh, Mr Wilhelm. 

WILHELM

(entering the office) Yes George. 

GEORGE

Hi, I was just uh... I just had one little question about uh, my assignment. 

WILHELM

Yes, well I trust things are moving smoothly. Mr Steinbrenner's counting on you, you know. 

GEORGE

Yes, yes. Very smooth, super smooth. No, but I really wanna attack this thing, you know. Sink my teeth into it. So I was just wondering... what do you think would be the very best way to get started? 

WILHELM

(confusion) Get started? I don't understand, George. 

GEORGE

Well, I was wondering... 

WILHELM

You mean you haven't been to payroll? 

GEORGE

Payroll? No, no, I haven't done that. 

WILHELM

Well, what's the problem? Now come on George. I told the big man you were moving on this. Now, don't let him down! 

GEORGE

Payroll!! 

GEORGE

Hello there. I'm George Costanza. 

CLERK

Yes? 

GEORGE

Assistant to the travelling secretary. (fishing for a reaction) I'm uh, working on the project. 

CLERK

What project? 

GEORGE

Payroll project. Wilhelm? Big uh, big payroll project. 

CLERK

You're gonna have to fill me in. 

GEORGE

You know what, I'll just uh, I'll just look around for a little while. (moving to come round the counter) I'll just browse around. 

CLERK

(blocking George) Hey, wait, hey. Excuse me, uh, you can't come back here. 

GEORGE

Look, I am under direct orders from Mr Wilhelm. So if you have a problem with that, maybe you should just take it up with him. 

CLERK

Well, maybe I will. 

GEORGE

(spotting possible salvation) You know what, I urge you to take it up with him. Go ahead, give him a call, he'll tell you what I'm doing here. (half to himself) Then you can tell me. 

CLERK

(on phone) Mr Wilhelm, uh, this is Lafarge in payroll. Uh, there's a Costanza here, says he's working on some project? 

CLERK

(on phone) Oh. (he swaps the phone to his other ear) Oh, I see. (listens) Interesting. (listens) Well, that's quite a project. Alright, thank you. 

CLERK

(apologetically) Ah, I'm sorry uh, that I doubted you. Whatever you need, just uh, make yourself at home. 

GEORGE

So he explained it all to you? 

CLERK

Yes, he explained it all very clearly. 

GEORGE

What'd he tell you? 

CLERK

(upset) Look! You were right, I was wrong! You don't have to humiliate me about it, alright! 

NEWMAN

Damn! 

NEWMAN

Oh, Mother's Day. (inspiration strikes) Wait a second. Mother's Day?! 

NEWMAN

(triumphant) Yessss! 

NEWMAN

Ahaha! 

NEWMAN

Come on Kramer! 

KRAMER

Wha...? 

NEWMAN

It's the truck, Kramer. The truck! 

KRAMER

Look, Newman, I told you to let this thing go. 

NEWMAN

No, no, no, no no. Listen to me. Most days, the post office sends one truckload of mail to the second domestic regional sorting facility in Sagenaw, Michigan. 

KRAMER

(interested) Uh-huh. 

NEWMAN

But, on the week before holidays, we see a surge. On alentine's Day, we send two trucks. On Christmas, four, packed to the brim. And tomorrow, if history is any guide, will see some spillover into a fifth truck. 

KRAMER

(realisation) Mother's Day. 

NEWMAN

The mother of all mail days. And guess who signed up for the truck. 

KRAMER

A free truck? Oh boy, that completely changes our cost structure. Our G and A goes down fifty percent. 

NEWMAN

(excited) We carry a coupla bags of mail, and the rest is ours! 

KRAMER

Newman, you magnificent bastard, you did it! 

NEWMAN

(triumph) Let the collecting begin! 

WILHELM

So... 

WILHELM

...did you go down to payroll? 

GEORGE

(standing) Yes, payroll. Yes I did. Very productive. Payroll... Paid off. 

WILHELM

(pleased) Well then, I guess you'll be heading downtown then, huh? 

GEORGE

Oh, yeah. Downtown. Definitely. 

WILHELM

Well, I'm very interested to see how this thing turns out. 

GEORGE

(to himself) Yeah, you said it. (to Wilhelm) Uh, excuse me, Mr Wilhelm. Uh, do you really think... Well, is this downtown trip really necessary, you know, for the project? 

WILHELM

Oh no, you've got to go downtown, George. It's all downtown. Just like the song says. 

GEORGE

The song? 

WILHELM

There's your answer. Downtown. 

GEORGE

(thoughtful) Downtown. 

JERRY

The song Downtown? You mean the Petula Clark song? 

GEORGE

Yeah. 

JERRY

You sure he didn't just mention it because you happened to be going downtown? 

GEORGE

I think he was trying to tell me something, like it had some sort of a meaning. 

JERRY

Okay, so how does it go? 

GEORGE

'When you're alone, and life is making you lonely, you can always go...' 

JERRY

'... downtown.' 

GEORGE

'Maybe you know some little places to go, where they never close...' 

JERRY

'...downtown.' 

GEORGE

Wait a second. 'Little places to go, where they never close.' What's a little place that never closes? 

JERRY

Seven-eleven? 

GEORGE

'Just listen to the music of the traffic, in the city. Linger on the sidewalk, where the neon lights are pretty.' Where the neon lights are pretty. The Broadway area? 

JERRY

No, that's midtown. 

GEORGE

'The lights are much brighter there. You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares, just go...' 

JERRY

'...down town.' 

GEORGE

'Things'll be great, when you're...' 

JERRY

'...downtown.' 

GEORGE

I got nothing, Jerry. Nothing. 

JERRY

Well, 'don't hang around and let your troubles surround you. There are movie shows...' 

GEORGE

You think I should come clean? What d'you think, you think I Should confess? 

JERRY

How can you lose? 

TONY

Yeah, Jerry, it's Tony Abato at the shop. Look, we gotta talk. You better come down, any time after four. 

JERRY

Hello. 

ELAINE

Hi, it's me. 

JERRY

Oh, hi. 

ELAINE

Listen, I need to come over and pick up the clubs for Peterman. 

JERRY

Oh, you know what? 

ELAINE

(worry) Oh no. What? 

JERRY

Oh, no. It's no big deal. I left the clubs in the car. 

ELAINE

You left them in the car? How could you leave them in the car? 

JERRY

I forgot. 

ELAINE

Oh, go down and get them. 

JERRY

I can't. The car's at the mechanics. 

ELAINE

Ah, this is great. Alright, well, where is the mechanic? I'll just go and pick 'em up myself. 

JERRY

No, no, you can't. He's working on the car right now. You can not disturb him while he's working. But I'm going down there in like an hour, if you wanna meet me down there. You know the place, it's on fifty-sixth street? 

ELAINE

(resigned) Ugh, okay, alright, fine. 

JERRY

Hey, Tony. 

TONY

Thanks for coming in, Jerry. 

JERRY

Sure. 

TONY

I think I know what's goin' on here, and I just wanna hear it from you. But I want you to be straight with me. Don't lie to me, Jerry. You know that motor oil you're puttin' in there? (reproachful) From one of those quicky lube places, isn't it? 

JERRY

Well, I change it so often, I mean to come all the way down here... 

TONY

Jerry, motor oil is the lifeblood of a car. Okay, you put in a low-grade oil, you could damage vital engine parts. Okay. (holds up component) See this gasket? (throws it down) I have no confidence in that gasket. 

JERRY

I really wanna... 

TONY

Here's what I wanna do. I wanna overhaul the entire engine. But it's gonna take a major commitment from you. You're gonna have to keep it under sixty miles an hour for a while. You gotta come in, and you gotta get the oil changed every thousand miles. 

JERRY

How much money is this gonna cost me? 

TONY

(contempt) Huh. I don't understand you. It's your own car we're talking about. You know you wrote the wrong mileage down on the form? You barely know the car. You don't know the mileage, you don't know the tyre pressure. When was the last time you even checked the washer fluid? 

JERRY

The washer fluid is fine. 

TONY

(angry) The washer fluid is not fine! 

JERRY

Alright, you know what, uhm... I just wanna take my car, and I'm gonna bring it someplace else. 

TONY

What d'you mean? 

JERRY

Just, can I have my car? I wanna pay my bill, I'm gonna be on my way. 

TONY

Well, the car's on a lift. 

JERRY

Well, just get it down. 

TONY

(subdued) Alright. Okay. Well, uhm, wait here and I'll uh, I'll bring it around. 

JERRY

Okay. Thank you, very much. 

ELAINE

Hey. Where's the car? 

JERRY

He's bringing it. 

ELAINE

Good. 

NOTE

Originally broadcast as part of a 60 min episode, with The Bottle Deposit (1) 

JERRY

Last week on Seinfeld. 

JERRY

Okay, thank you. (hangs up the phone) 

ELAINE

So? What'd they say? 

JERRY

They're sending a detective to my apartment tomorrow. 

ELAINE

What the hell were you thinking leaving my clubs in that car?! 

JERRY

Well, I didn't count on my mechanic pulling a Mary-Beth Whitehead, did I? 

ELAINE

What kind of maniac is this guy? 

JERRY

He's a very special maniac. 

ELAINE

What am I supposed to tell Mr Peterman. 

JERRY

I don't know. 

ELAINE

Why couldn't you take better care of that car?! 

PETERMAN

Well, are they here? 

ELAINE

Mr Peterman, uh... There seems to be a bit of a snag. 

PETERMAN

Snag? 

ELAINE

It seems that a psychotic mechanic has absconded with my friend's car. 

PETERMAN

What does that have to do with my clubs? 

ELAINE

They happened to be in the back seat at the time. 

DETECTIVE

What was the suspect wearing at the time of the incident? 

JERRY

You know, like mechanic's pants, a shirt that said 'Tony'. Lemme ask you something, have you ever seen a case like this before? 

DETECTIVE

All the time. A mechanic forms an emotional attachment, thinks he'sgonna lose the car, he panics, he does something rash. I'm gonna ask you somepersonal questions. I'm sorry if I touch a nerve, but I think it'll help with the case. Had you been taking good care of the car? 

JERRY

Had I been taking...? 

DETECTIVE

Well, did you leave the A/C on? Do you zip over speed bumps? Do you ride the clutch? Things like that. 

JERRY

W-well, what does it matter? It's my car, I can do whatever I want with it. 

JERRY

Not that I would think of doing such things. 

DETECTIVE

(making a note) Alright Mr Seinfeld, we'll let you know if we find anything. I gotta be honest with you, these cases never end up well. 

JERRY

Well uh, whatever you can do. Thanks. 

GEORGE

(hesitant) Uh, Mr Wilhelm. Uh, about the project... 

WILHELM

That's what I came to talk to you about. Great job George. (shakes George's hand) You really nailed it. 

GEORGE

I did? 

WILHELM

Oh yes, I read through it this morning. I couldn't have done it better myself, and I turned it right over to Mr Steinbrenner. Good work George. 

JERRY

I don't get it. He assigns it to you, you don't do it. Somehow it gets done, and now he's telling you what a great job you did. 

GEORGE

Maybe somebody did it and didn't take credit for it. Maybe it was already done and didn't need doing in the first place. I have no idea who did it, what they did, or how they did it so well. And you know what? Jimmy crack corn and I don't care. 

WILHELM

The gardener did a nice job planting the rose bushes, didn't he dear? 

WILHELM

You planted the rose bushes, dear. 

WILHELM

I did? 

WILHELM

Yesterday. You remember. 

WILHELM

(thinks for a moment) That's right. (pause) What's for dinner? 

WILHELM

We just ate. Did you forget to take your medicine? 

GEORGE

The point is, however it got done, it's done. So, any luck with the car? 

JERRY

No. The police have no leads (sitting on the couch arm) and I just found out today my insurance doesn't cover it. 

GEORGE

Why not? 

JERRY

They don't consider it stolen, if you wilfully give the guy the keys. 

ELAINE

(to George) Hey. 

GEORGE

Hey. 

ELAINE

(to Jerry) Hey. What did the detective say? 

JERRY

They're looking. 

GEORGE

I gotta go. 

JERRY

Y'hello. 

DETECTIVE

Mr Seinfeld? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

DETECTIVE

It's Detective McMahon... 

DETECTIVE

...I'm at the warehouse on Pier 38. Ah, I think you'd better get down here. 

JERRY

Yeah, okay. (to Elaine) They may have found the car. 

ELAINE

(makes surprise noise) Are the clubs in it? Ask him. 

JERRY

Are there golf clubs in the back? 

DETECTIVE

We really can't tell. You better bring your service records. 

COP

Watch where you step. There's quite a bit of... grease. Detective, Jerry Seinfeld is here. 

DETECTIVE

How d'you do. Thanks for coming down. 

JERRY

(indicating) This is Elaine Benes. 

ELAINE

(explaining) We used to date, but now we're just friends. 

DETECTIVE

I see. 

JERRY

Yeah. 

DETECTIVE

I'm sorry to make you go through this, but we need to make sure. 

JERRY

Well, what's going on? What is this thing? 

DETECTIVE

One of our patrolmen stumbled over this. 

ELAINE

(horrified) Huuh! (she turns away and covers her mouth) 

JERRY

Oh my God! 

DETECTIVE

The block is nearly split apart. We found the overhead cams thirty feet away. We can only hope the body sold for scrap. 

ELAINE

Oh, my God. 

DETECTIVE

And we know it's a Saab. The angle on the Vee-6 is definitely ninety-two. The model is hard to determine because the drive train is all burnt out. 

JERRY

What is that smell? 

DETECTIVE

Look at the clutch. 

ELAINE

Uuh. 

COP

Excuse me. 

DETECTIVE

Whoever did this didn't just dismantle it. I mean, they took their time, they had fun. They were very systematic. They went out of their way to gouge the sides of every piston, and the turbo was separated from the housing and shoved right up the exhaust pipe. 

ELAINE

Uhh 

JERRY

Wait a second. Turbo? I didn't have a turbo. 

DETECTIVE

Your car's not a turbo? 

JERRY

No, it's a nine-hundred S. (happy) It's a turbo, Elaine, a turbo! 

ELAINE

(sobbing happiness) It's a tu-hur-bo. 

WOMAN

Excuse me, did you say turbo? Saab turbo nine-thousand? Is it... (voice breaking) midnight blue? 

DETECTIVE

(condolences) Yes ma'am. 

NEWMAN

(singing) Nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine bottle and cans in the trunk, nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine bottles and cans. At ten cents a bottle and ten cents a can, we're pulling in five hundred dollars a man. Nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight bottle and cans in the trunk, nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight bottles and cans. We fill up with gas, we count up our cash!!... 

JERRY

Hello. 

TONY

Hey Jerry, it's Tony. 

JERRY

Tony, where are you? 

TONY

Aw look, I just want you to know that the car is fine. I got her all fixed up. We're in a nice area, no potholes, no traffic. So there's nothing to worry about. Okay? In fact, here, somebody wants to talk to you. 

JERRY

Tony, y-you better bring that car back! 

TONY

(angry) Nobody's giving anything back! You tried to take it from me, I don't forget that. 

JERRY

Tony, it is my car, and I want it back! 

TONY

Oh, your car. You want your car back! 

JERRY

Tony. 

TONY

Listen, that registration may have your name on it, Jerry. But this engine's running on my sweat and my blood. 

JERRY

(exasperated) Where do I find these guys? 

NEWMAN

How much gas we got? 

KRAMER

Three quarters of a tank. 

KRAMER

That's better than we estimated. 

NEWMAN

(smugly) That is seven dollars and twenty-two cents better. 

NEWMAN

Maybe we could uh, stop for a snack. 

KRAMER

Ah, no, that's not in the budget. 

NEWMAN

Yeah well, the budget changed, you know. I mean, it might be a good investment. 

KRAMER

That's not a good investment, that's a loss. 

KRAMER

Hey, d'you see that car? Looks like Jerry's. I'm gonna check out that license plate. 

KRAMER

Yeah, those are New York plates. 

NEWMAN

Is that Jerry's number? 

KRAMER

I don't know, but that's New York and we're in Ohio. Those are pretty good odds. 

NEWMAN

What're you doing? 

KRAMER

I'm calling Jerry. 

NEWMAN

On what? 

KRAMER

Brought my phone. 

JERRY

(answering phone) Y'hello. 

KRAMER

Yeah, hey Jerry, what's your licence plate number? 

JERRY

Why, what's up? 

KRAMER

Yeah, well I think I spotted your car. 

JERRY

Oh my god, you're kidding. (dives for his wallet) Hang on a second. (reading from his registration) It's JVN 728. 

KRAMER

(checks the car ahead of him) Hey, that's it! That's it. Hey, uh look, we got him. We're driving right behind him in a truck. 

JERRY

Oh my god. Yeah, yeah, he said he brought it to the country. 

KRAMER

Well we're in the country and we're right on his tail. 

JERRY

Good work Kramer, this is incredible. 

KRAMER

Yeah, don't worry Jerry. We're right on this guy like stink on a monkey! I'll check back with you. 

ELAINE

Elaine Benes. 

JERRY

Yeah, it's me. Kramer found the car! 

ELAINE

Oh my god, where is it? 

JERRY

It's somewhere in the country, they're following 'em. 

ELAINE

Are the clubs there? 

JERRY

I don't know. They're tailing him. I'm waiting for them to call me back. 

ELAINE

Alright, I'm heading over right now. 

ELAINE

What's the status? 

JERRY

Last check-in, they were still on him. 

ELAINE

Well, have they called the police yet? 

JERRY

No, they won't call the police. 

ELAINE

What? Why not? 

JERRY

They're afraid they'll get in trouble for misusing a mail truck. Kramer doesn't want a record. 

ELAINE

Kramer has a record. 

JERRY

Not a Federal record. 

JERRY

Kramer? 

JERRY

What's going on? 

KRAMER

Yeah, nothing. We're still following him. 

KRAMER

Wait a second, he's getting off. Yeah, he's gonna be going south on the one-thirty-five. 

ELAINE

Keep following him. 

KRAMER

Alright, alright, I'll follow him. 

NEWMAN

Hey, we can't follow him, we're going north to Michigan. 

KRAMER

Yeah, hey listen, I can't. It's gonna be taking us out of our way. 

ELAINE

I need those clubs. 

JERRY

Kramer, I want my car. 

KRAMER

Well, I don't know what to do. 

NEWMAN

Hey, we got ten thousand deposit bottles here. I mean, this guy could be going to Arkansas. 

JERRY

Keep following him Kramer. don't let me down. 

NEWMAN

Hey, don't listen to him. I mean, we can't afford a detour. Our budget won't hold it. 

KRAMER

Well, I don't know what to do man! 

NEWMAN

Kramer! Stay left. Left, left, left. 

JERRY

Right. Go right!/South! 

KRAMER

Alright! Alright. I'm getting off! I'm gonna go on the ramp. 

NEWMAN

I hope you realise what you've done. You've destroyed our whole venture. 

KRAMER

This ramp is steep. 

NEWMAN

All my work, my planning, my genius. All for nought. 

KRAMER

Alright, look, we're pulling too much weight. He's getting away from us here. (indicating) Take the wheel. 

NEWMAN

What're you doing? 

KRAMER

(climbing though into the back of the truck) I'm gonna get something. 

NEWMAN

Are you crazy? 

KRAMER

Keep your foot on the gas. 

NEWMAN

Hey! You're not dumping those bottles back there, are you? 

NEWMAN

Hey Kramer, those have wholesale value! We could cut our losses. 

KRAMER

Look out below!! 

STEINBRENNER

(to himself) With this magnifying glass, I feel like a scientist. 

GEORGE

You wanted to see me, sir? 

STEINBRENNER

Ah, come in George, come in. 

STEINBRENNER

Uh, Wilhelm gave me this project you worked on. 

GEORGE

(smiling) Yes sir. 

STEINBRENNER

Let me ask you something, George. You having any personal problems at home? Girl trouble, love trouble of any kind? 

GEORGE

(wondering where this is leading) No sir. 

STEINBRENNER

What about drugs? You doing some of that crack cocaine? You on the pipe? 

GEORGE

(worried now) No sir. 

STEINBRENNER

Are you seeing a psychiatrist? Bcause I got a flash for you young man, you're non compos mentis! You got some bats in the belfry! 

GEORGE

What're.. What're you talking about? 

STEINBRENNER

George, I've read this report. It's very troubling, very troubling indeed. It's a sick mind at work here. 

STEINBRENNER

Okay, come on boys, come on in here. George, this is Herb and Dan. 

STEINBRENNER

They're gonna take you away to a nice place where you can get some help. They're very friendly people there. My brother-in-law was there for a couple of weeks. The man was obsessed with lactating women. They completely cured him, although he still eats a lot of cheese. 

GEORGE

Ah, see, Mister.. I didn't write that report. That, that's not mine. 

STEINBRENNER

Of course you didn't George. Of course you didn't write it. 

GEORGE

I didn't do it! It..It just got done. I don't know how it got done, but it did. 

STEINBRENNER

Of course. Of course it got done. Things get done all the time, I understand. (as George disappears) Don't worry, your job'll be waiting for you when you get back. (banging his fist on his desk) Get better George. Get better! 

KRAMER

(frustrated) Damn. I don't understand this. I've ditched every bottle and can, and we still can't gain. It's like we're... 

KRAMER

...sluggish. 

NEWMAN

I went through all those bottles and all those cans, for what? What a waste. And I'm really gonna catch hell for those missing mailbags. 

KRAMER

Heyy, wasn't that a pie stand back there? 

NEWMAN

(perks up) A pie stand? Where? 

KRAMER

Oh yeah. Home-made pies, two hundred yards back. 

NEWMAN

Aww, c'mon, pull over, pull over will ya. 

NEWMAN

Where? I..I..I don't see it. 

KRAMER

Well open the door, you get a better look. 

NEWMAN

I don't see any pie... 

NEWMAN

...Aargh! 

NEWMAN

Kramer!! 

KRAMER

I'm sorry Newman, you were holding us back. 

NEWMAN

(after speeding truck) Kramer!! 

KRAMER

(shouting) Jerry! We've lost the fat man, and we're running lean. We're back on track, buddy! 

NEWMAN

Federal employee. Federal employee. 

FARMER

Hello stranger. 

NEWMAN

(a touch desperate) Ah, look, I..I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm a US postal worker and my mail truck was just ambushed by a band of backwoods mail-hating survivalists. 

FARMER

Calm down, now. Calm down. Don't worry, we'll take care of you. This farm ain't much, but uh, you're welcome to what we have. Hot bath, hearty meal, clean bed. 

NEWMAN

Oh, thank you, sir. 

FARMER

Just have one rule. Keep your hands off my daughter. 

KRAMER

Jerry, we got 'im. I'm riding his tail. There's no escape. He's running scared, buddy. 

JERRY

How's the gas situation? 

KRAMER

(checks dial) I got enough to get to Memphis. 

KRAMER

He's reaching in back. He's grabbing at something. 

KRAMER

He's pulling out a gun! He's got a gun, Jerry!! 

JERRY

Duck, Kramer! Duck! 

KRAMER

It's a golf club! It's no gun. He threw a golf club at me! 

ELAINE

Those are JFK's golf clubs! 

KRAMER

Hey, I'm under fire here. (another club hits) I'm under heavy fire here, boy. (another hit) Jeez! That was a five-iron! 

ELAINE

Stop the truck, Kramer. Pick up the clubs! 

JERRY

No, don't stop, Kramer. Keep going, don't let him get away. 

KRAMER

Wait a minute, I think he's done. (peers at the Saab) Oh no, he's taking out the woods! 

KRAMER

(noise) 

KRAMER

(yelling at Tony) You'll have to do a lot better than that! 

JERRY

(hearing the noises) What's happening! 

KRAMER

This truck is dying. We're losing him. 

KRAMER

I think we lost him. 

JERRY

(disappointment) Dammit! 

ELAINE

(quietly) Can you stop and pick up those clubs Kramer? 

KRAMER

(subdued) Yeah, yeah, I'll get 'em. 

FARMER

Enjoy that mutton? 

NEWMAN

(mouth full) It's delicious mutton. This is uh, this is outta sight. I would, I would love to get the recipe. It's very good. 

FARMER

That cider too strong for you? 

NEWMAN

No, no. I love strong cider. (for the farmer's daughter's benefit) I'm a big, strong, cider guy. 

FARMER

Gonna be milking Holsteins in the morning, if you'd like to lend a hand. 

NEWMAN

(reluctant) You know, I don't really know that much about uh.. I don't have any.. I don't.. I don't think I know much about that. 

FARMER

Ahh, Susie here'll teach you. 

FARMER

Just gotta pull on the teat a little. 

SUSIE

(suggestive) Nice having a big, strong, man around. 

NEWMAN

You know, those mail bags, they get mighty heavy. I uh, I Nautilus, of course. (puffs out his chest) 

NEWMAN

(breaking from his pose) Can I have some gravy? 

GEORGE

(desperate) Steinbrenner had me committed! I'm in the nuthouse! 

DEENA

I'll be back same time next week, Pop. 

GEORGE

(quieter desperation) They took my belt, Jerry. I got nothing to hold my pants up. (listens) Well, you gotta come over here now! Just tell 'em what we talked about, how I, how I, I didn't do the project. 

DEENA

George? 

DEENA

I see you're finally getting some help. 

GEORGE

Aw, hoh, oh Deena, thank God. (he hugs Deena) Thank God you're here. Listen, you gotta help me. You gotta tell these people that I'm okay. You know that I don't belong in here. 

DEENA

George, this is the best thing for you. (she walks away) 

GEORGE

Yea... (sinks in) What? No, no! 

GEORGE

Deena! Deena, wait a... Deena, help! 

POP

Is that little Georgie C? How's the folks? You still got that nice little car? 

NEWMAN

(screaming in panic) Aaah!! Aaah! 

KRAMER

What you doing?! 

NEWMAN

(pushing past Kramer) Kramer, help me! Help me! 

KRAMER

(takes one look and sets off after Newman) Jeez! 

FARMER

(taking aim) I told you to keep away from my daughter! 

SUSIE

No daddy, you'll hurt him! I love him! (waving after Newman) Goodbye Norman, goodbye. 

PETERMAN

(excited) Elaine! You found the clubs. That's wonderful news. Where are they? 

ELAINE

(not the soul of happiness) Yep. Lemme get 'em for you, Mr Peterman. 

PETERMAN

Oh, I'll be inaugrating them this weekend, with none other than Ethel Kennedy. A woman whose triumph in the face of tragedy is exceeded only by her proclivity to procreate. 

ELAINE

The uh, the letter of, authenticity's in the side pocket there. 

PETERMAN

Elaine. I never knew Kennedy had such a temper. 

ELAINE

(spotting a chance to keep her job) Oh. Oh yeah. The only thing worse was his slice. (she laughs nervously) 

PETERMAN

See you on Monday. 

ELAINE

Have a good game. 

JERRY

Hairdo? 

ELAINE

(Looking up from a menu) Yeah. 

JERRY

You look like Brenda Starr. 

ELAINE

Is that good? 

JERRY

It's better than Dondi. 

ELAINE

Hey, my God, look at that. (Jerry looks over at the table. A man and a woman are dining) David and Beth Lookner. (Leaning in for confidentiality) You know, I heard a rumor their marriage was a little rocky. 

JERRY

(Interested, still looking at the couple) Really? 

ELAINE

Mm-hmm. 

JERRY

You know, I have a little thing for Beth Lookner. 

ELAINE

Well, I have to admit, I've always thought David was kind of sponge-worthy. (Winks, making a clicking sound with her tongue) 

JERRY

Yeah.. I've been waitin' out their marriage for three years. 

ELAINE

Yeah, me too. Well, I've been waiting out two or three marriages, but this is the one I really had my eye on. 

GEORGE

This car out there is taking up, like, three parking spaces. 

ELAINE

Oh, (Laughs at George's misfortune) that's mine. 

GEORGE

You have a car? 

ELAINE

Well, my friend, Elise, lent it to me for the week. She's out of town. 

JERRY

(Noting) You know, I've never seen you drive. 

GEORGE

Me either. 

BETH

(Unsure as to whether it's him or not) Jerry? Elaine, Hi! 

ELAINE

(Overly generous) Hi, David! 

JERRY

Hi, Beth! 

BETH

Oh, uh, George, (Introducing to two) this is my husband, David. 

GEORGE

Oh, hi.. (They shake hands) 

DAVID

Hello. So, George, uh, you're the one who works for the Yankees, right? 

GEORGE

Yeah. Why, what do you do? 

DAVID

Well, I sell insurance, but Beth used to be Don Mattingly's doctor. 

GEORGE

Really? 

BETH

Mm-hm. 

DAVID

Yeah. 

GEORGE

(Laughs slightly) A physician married to a salesman. (Chuckles) Well, I gotta tell you, Beth, you coulda done a lot better than him. 

KRAMER

Hey! 

JERRY

Hey. Hey, Mickey. What's going on? 

MICKEY

I'm very nervous. I'm auditioning to be in the Actor's Studio tonight. 

JERRY

Really? 

KRAMER

It's a method, Jerry. It's intense. (Clicks his tongue) 

MICKEY

Kramer's going to be my scene partner. 

JERRY

Kramer? 

MICKEY

He doesn't have to say anything, he just has to sit there. I'm playing a detective. 

KRAMER

Yeah, and I'm playing a business man accused of murder. 

JERRY

Ohh boy. Well, I gotta meet Elaine and run some errands. So.. (Goes for his coat) 

KRAMER

(Fixing up his pants) Yeah.. look at this, Mickey. These pants are fallin' apart, huh? 

JERRY

(Fishing for his keys in a kitchen drawer) You know, when I first met you, Kramer, you used to wear jeans all the time. 

KRAMER

(Looking over Mickey's shoulder at the script) Yeah, well, I was a different man then. 

JERRY

(Jokingly playing off Kramer's statement) With a different body. 

KRAMER

(Slightly offended) Hey, I got the body of a.. taught, pre-teen, Swedish boy. 

JERRY

Ehh, I dunno.. 

KRAMER

Now, what are you thinkin'? (Getting upset) You think that I'm not able to wear jeans anymore? Is that what you're sayin'? Because if that's what you're sayin', Jerry, I'll go and I'll buy some jeans. (Jerry shrugs. Kramer raises his voice to a menacing tone) I swear to God I will! (Jerry's showing off a skeptical face. 

ELAINE

God, it is so great to drive again. I miss it so much! (Suddenly swerves to the right, then yells out of her window) How about a left turn signal, ya moron?! 

JERRY

(His thoughts) I'm so nauseous. She's the worst driver. 

ELAINE

You know what? On my first road test, I hit a dog. (Jerry nods, blinking) I think it was a golden retriever. No, no, no, it was a - it was a yellow lab. (Picks up the car phone) I'm gonna check my messages. (Begins to dial as she pulls up to a pedestrian crosswalk. She stops right before hitting a man crossing the street) 

MAN

Hey! 

JERRY

(Once again, the audience hears his thoughts) I'm so car sick. I'm gonna vomit! 

ELAINE

Oh my God! Jerry! My friend, Kim called - David and Beth got separated last night! 

JERRY

(Out of it) Huh? 

ELAINE

They're gettin' divorced! (Quickly breaks, stopping traffic) 

ELAINE

So, now, what is our move? What do we do? 

JERRY

I don't know, but we don't have much time. 

ELAINE

(Agreeing) Mm. 

JERRY

The city's probably teeming with people who've been waiting out that marriage. 

ELAINE

Right. 

JERRY

It's like when tenant dies in a rent controlled building - you gotta take immediate action. 

ELAINE

Yeeah, but David and Beth are going to need their grieving time. 

JERRY

Their grieving time is a luxury I can't afford. I'm calling Beth tonight, and if you want a clean shot at David, I suggest you do likewise. 

ELAINE

(Nodding) Yeah, yeah.. 

JERRY

But we gotta make it seem like we're not calling for dates. 

ELAINE

Then why are we calling? 

JERRY

Good question. (More to himself than to Elaine) Why are we calling? 

ELAINE

Ah! (Jerry has a surprised look) I've got it! I've got it! We're calling just to say, 'I'm there for you.' 

JERRY

(Nodding, trying it out) 'I'm there for you.' 

ELAINE

Then, after a period of being 'there for you', we slowly remove the two words 'for you', and we're just (Makes a 'ta-da!' gesture) 'there'. 

ELAINE

Hey. 

JERRY

Hey, remember Beth and David from yesterday? They got separated. 

GEORGE

Really? (Realizes) Well, you don't think it had anything to do with what I said, do you? 

JERRY

What'd you say? 

GEORGE

You know, that, that thing about her being too good for him. I mean, I was just bein' folksy. They could tell I was just being folksy..? 

ELAINE

Yeah, I thought you were being folksy. 

GEORGE

Totally folksy. 

JERRY

hey, uh.. (Kramer walks around a little) what'd you get there? 

KRAMER

Uh, yeah, I bought Dungarees. 

ELAINE

Kramer, they're painted on! 

KRAMER

Well, they're slim-fit. 

JERRY

Slim-fit? 

KRAMER

(Talking fast) Yeah, they're streamlined. 

JERRY

You're walkin' like Frankenstein! 

KRAMER

(Making his way toward the door) What? They just gotta be worked in a little bit, that's all. (Pulling the door shut behind him) Alright, see you later. 

ELAINE

(Mock sympathy) Well.. David, it happens. 

JERRY

Sure, Beth, these things happen. (Brief pause) So, have you told many.. people yet? 

ELAINE

Because it's really nobody's business. 

JERRY

Anyway, I just called to tell you that, I'm there for you. 

ELAINE

'There' is, um.. anywhere you want me to be.. 

JERRY

Sure, dinner would be fine. 

ELAINE

And I could just be there. (Adding) For you. 

KRAMER

Jerry, you gotta help me! 

JERRY

What's wrong? 

KRAMER

I can't get my pants off, and Mickey's audition is in twenty minutes! You know, I'm supposed to be a business man, I gotta be in costume! 

JERRY

Alright, alright. Uh, undo them. I'll help you get them off. 

KRAMER

(Bracing himself on a bar stool) Yeah, I already did it. It won't come off. The zipper's suck.. 

JERRY

(Walks over and starts pulling on Kramer's pants) You just gotta wiggle your hips a little bit. 

KRAMER

(Wiggling and floppin) Pull Down 

JERRY

(Stops pulling on the pants) Alright, alright, That's no good. (Moves Kramer over to the couch) Let me try getting them from the bottom. (Goes for Kramer's Leg) Just gimme one leg. 

KRAMER

(Feet off the ground, his body going everywhere on the couch) Wait, Jerry...Wait a minu... 

JERRY

(Still pulling on Kramer's pants from the ankles) Man these are tight. (Yanking) Squinch your hips in 

JERRY

(Still pulling) Squinch em! 

KRAMER

(Getting Pulled and pulled) I...um...ei... 

JERRY

(Stops) Alright, that's not gonna work, it's not gonna work. Let me just think for a second here. 

KRAMER

(Starts to tilt back onto the couch) You better get me. (Falls back and Jerry starts to him upright) Get me up, Get me up, Get me up. 

JERRY

Hold it, hold it...Look your gonna need the jaws of life to get out of those things. 

KRAMER

(walking toward the door) Look I don't have time to wait, I'm gonna be late. 

JERRY

(Kramer waddling out the door) Maybe you can soak in the tub. 

KRAMER

You better get the door. 

BETH

It was nice to get your call. 

JERRY

Well, I just want you to know I'm there for you. Course now I'm here for you, but when i'm not here for you, i'm there for you. 

BETH

(Laughing) Well where ever you are i appreciate it. 

JERRY

So how did this all happen? 

BETH

Well actually, it had a lot to do with George's comment. 

JERRY

(stunned) Is that right? 

BETH

I thought maybe i could do better. 

JERRY

Maybe, maybe 

BETH

Well it wasn't just that, i realized after 3 years of marriage that David's little quirks were getting on my nerves a little. 

JERRY

(agreeing) well three years is a long time to be married. 

BETH

Like in the middle of our fight last night he did this thing that he always does where he asks questions to himself, aloud. And then answers them. 

DAVID

Am I happy Beth left me? Of course not. Do I hope to pick up the pieces and move on? Absolutely 

ELAINE

You're gonna pick up the pieces. 

DAVID

Just had our third anniversary on April 8th 

ELAINE

10th 

DAVID

(very sad) right 

ELAINE

Right 

DAVID

(Mad) You know as far as I'm concerned, this whole thing is George's fault 

ELAINE

Well, David the thing about George is that he's an idiot. 

DIRECTOR

Alright, auditioning next is Mickey Abbott (Mickey starts looking around for Kramer and checks his watch) Doing a scene from the Terrance Clifford play 'Press wounds in Ithaca' 

MICKEY

(stands up) Sorry my scene partner isn't here yet so I guess uh..(Kramer enters and runs into some chairs) Oh 

KRAMER

Hey, sorry I'm late. 

MICKEY

(quietly talking to Kramer) What's with the jeans you're supposed to be a business man 

KRAMER

I know, it's a long story. 

MICKEY

Well just get up there 

MICKEY

So, Bradley. I guess this is the last place you expected to find yourself. 

KRAMER

(takes a breath) 

MICKEY

Well we're gonna be here a while so take a seat. (Kramer starts trying to sit down, Mickey has his back to him and gets out a pack of cigarettes, Mickey then turns around once he has his cigarette to find Kramer struggling to sit down) You know if it hadn't been for that secretary of yours...I said sit down! (Kramer still trying to sit down, Mickey throws the pack of cigarettes to the floor) Are you deaf Bradley?! I said sit down! 

KRAMER

(still trying to sit down, says under his breath) I'm trying. {hard to make out} 

MICKEY

(almost starts to laugh) Bradley! (looking to the crowd) It's very important that you sit down (Kramer still trying to sit down) Now for the last time, (angry) Try again to Sit Down! (Running at Kramer with his arms in the air) Sit down you big stupid Ape! (Mickey tackles Kramer) 

ELAINE

Did I have a great time with David Lickner last night? I sure did. (Jerry comes over to the couch with a beverage and sits down) Do I think there is a future here? I don't see why not. 

JERRY

I'll tell you, that There for you crap was a stroke of genius. 

ELAINE

Ooooh, please. 

JERRY

Never mind 

ELAINE

Ah come on 

JERRY

You're a Genius! 

ELAINE

Aaalright! 

ELAINE

Mmmnn, Georgie! 

GEORGE

(confused) What, what's going on? 

JERRY

What's going on? You're the man of the hour, That's what's going on. 

ELAINE

Right 

GEORGE

What do you mean? 

ELAINE

Well thanks to you and your little comment there to David and Beth. Jerry and I are in prime pouncing position to scoop these two up (Jerry and Elaine do a little slow dance of joy) before they know what hit em. 

GEORGE

So it was my comment that broke them up? 

JERRY

According to them 

ELAINE

Ya 

GEORGE

I feel terrible, I can't be responsible for breaking up a marriage. Oh no (starting moving for the door, Elaine begins to stop him) 

JERRY

(moving over to block the door) Where are you going? 

GEORGE

Well I gotta go talk to Beth. 

JERRY

Talk to Beth? 

GEORGE

Well I gotta undo what I did. 

JERRY

You're not undoing anything. 

GEORGE

Oh yes I am 

JERRY

Oh no you're not! 

GEORGE

(starts to try to get passed Jerry and Elaine) Alright get out of my way. (Jerry and Elaine push him back, George very annoyed) Alright don't make me get physical here! 

ELAINE

(Put her finger in George's face) You be careful George. 

BETH

(Opens the door to reveal a ruffed up George) George?! 

GEORGE

Hi Beth (Scene Ends then re-begins with Beth and George on Beth's couch) Um anyway Jerry told me that uh.. it might have been my comment in the Coffee Shop that broke you up. 

BETH

Oh, well you know it's funny George. Sometimes you don't know how you're really feeling about something until a person like you comes along and articulates it so perfectly. 

GEORGE

Oh (snorts) Articulate....Me? I've never articulated anything, i'm completely incoherent. 

BETH

(gets up to answer the phone) I don't know about that. Hold on (Picks phone up) Hello...Hi (pauses for Jerry to speak) ya last night I had a good time too (pauses for Jerry to speak) Really? that's so funny he's here right now. 

JERRY

BETH

(talk to Jerry) Sure. (starts to hand George the phone) George it's Jerry. 

GEORGE

He..he wants to talk to me? 

BETH

Ya he says he wants to say hello. 

GEORGE

Sweet guy (Receives the phone from Beth, Starts to talk to Jerry) Hello 

JERRY

GEORGE

Oh Jerry, that is so sweet of you but actually i already ate. 

JERRY

Ate? What? What the hell are you talking about? Now you listen to me, you get out of that apartment this instant. If you screw this up for me I swear.... 

GEORGE

(cuts into Jerry talking) Chocolate chip mint? Oh well, actually Jerry I prefer chocolate chip. What is it about the chocolate and the mint that makes it go so well together? 

JERRY

What are you talking about? 

GEORGE

Oh of course you can use it, sure. (Jerry saying stuff through the phone) Ok, bye. (hangs the phone up) 

KRAMER

Hey 

JERRY

Hey, are you still wearing those things. 

KRAMER

Oh ya, I think they are starting to loosen up a bit. (Mrs. Anvino come to Jerry's threshold) Oh hi Mrs. Anvino. 

ANVINO

Oh Kramer would you do me a favor my baby sitter hasn't show up could you come watch Joey for an hour I gotta run out. 

KRAMER

JERRY

Ya i could try and do that. 

ELAINE

(Pushing Jerry) You don't try, you Do It! I got the loser in this relationship and I'm breathing new life into him, you give me three more days, he won't be able to remember her name. You got the winner, you got the easy part. Alright let's go (claps) I'll drive you over there. Come on.

ELAINE

ELAINE

SUSAN

GEORGE

ELAINE

(Car tires screeching) Woah, ahhh. Hehe Ha ha ha. That was close. Confide in her, open up to her. You know women like that. 

JERRY

I don't feel so good. 

JERRY

Anyway Beth, you know i was thinking on my way over how when i was 9. I wanted these handball sneakers, they were all black but they came in adult sizes so you know i never got the sneakers. (Beth looks him confused) 

BETH

Oh really? 

ELAINE

My father left us when I was 9 so I guess that is why i have such a fear of abandonment. 

DAVID

Wow that's so touching 

ELAINE

Yes it is. 

DAVID

(Looking in through the window) Hey it's George 

ELAINE

Oh, maybe we should go some place else.

MICKEY

KRAMER

KRAMER

SUSAN

MICKEY

KRAMER

MICKEY

KRAMER

I'm sitting in the coffee shop, i'm talking to Susan, were talking about shoe laces (does two guns to the head) so in walks..in walks David, right, he walks right to the table..righ I introduced him to Susan..and he says get this (laughs) he says 'boy you could do a lot better than this guy' huh right (more laughing by George, Jerry is totally just mellow and straight faced) The exact same thing that I said to him, just to get back at me just to get back at me..and then, and then she says she wants to be alone for awhile..Alone Jerry! I think that she thinks that she could do better (laughs) Do you appreciate this? Do you see the irony of this? Do you see what is going on here? What's the matter? 

JERRY

I'm nauseous. 

GEORGE

JERRY

GEORGE

He..hmmm. humm...What about this one. 

CLERK

Hmmm,..to tell you the truth they haven't manufactured that one for a number of years. I might have couple of boxes left in our warehouse in New Jersey. I'd have to check. 

SUSAN

Oh! no. George that's so ugly we don't want that. 

GEORGE

What's the difference you just read it and mail it right back. These we'll do. 

SUSAN

Why don't they make'em anymore? 

CLERK

Well.. For one thing the glue isn't very adhesive. It takes a lot of moisture to make them stick. 

GEORGE

So we pick up some (word missing) 

SUSAN

(disappointed)All right. You see what I do for you. 

GEORGE

Hey! Kramer. 

KRAMER

JERRY

That's it? 

GEORGE

BOTH

Seems a little short, yeah.. 

JERRY

You can't go to China What about your job? 

GEORGE

My Job..arghhh 

JERRY

So write a letter.. move to another...move to Staten Island., 'lot easier to blend in a sea of people in Staten Island than China believe me. 

GEORGE

Yeah! Yeah!..Staten Island . What about my clothes ,how do I get the rest of the clothes? 

JERRY

Aagh! You come back for your clothes 

GEORGE

I'm not going back in there. 

JERRY

So forget about your clothes. 

GEORGE

Well I'm not starting up a whole new wardrobe now!!! 

JERRY

Look, freedom with no clothes is a lot better than no freedom with clothes. 

GEORGE

If she'd just take a plane somewhere. 

JERRY

And what, hope for a crash? 

GEORGE

It happens. 

JERRY

You know what the odds are on a crash it's a million to one. 

GEORGE

It's something . It's hope. 

ELAINE

Hey!...( sees George) HEY!! Georgie. You know what I just realized; the wedding is like a month away.ha..haa.. 

JERRY

Euhh...Elaine.... 

ELAINE

What?...Oh! by the way. What am I going to be in the wedding party? 

GEORGE

What do you mean? 

ELAINE

Well Jerry's gonna be the best man and Kramer's gonna be the usher so what am I gonna be? 

GEORGE

I don't know. I don't think you're anything. 

ELAINE

Wel...I have to be something. I 'm a close friend....What about being a bridesmaid. 

GEORGE

Those are Susan's friends. 

ELAINE

Well then...aaahh how about being an usher? 

GEORGE

Well...I'll ask Susan about it later. 

ELAINE

You don't ask.. You tell. 

GEORGE

( to Jerry) What about the letter, should I think about the letter? 

JERRY

Hey Elaine if a guy wanted to end a relationship with you . What could he do? 

ELAINE

Start smoking. 

GEORGE

Smoking. 

JERRY

Does she hate cigarettes? 

GEORGE

Yes, she hates cigarettes. 

JERRY

But you don't smoke. 

GEORGE

Nooooooo...... 

JERRY

You know, I think I'm getting a little depressed about George's wedding. 

ELAINE

Really? 

JERRY

Yeah. Well once he gets married that's it, she'll probably get pregnant, they'll move to Westchester. I'll never see him again. 

ELAINE

Yeah! You're probably right. 

JERRY

Then it'll just be me, you and Kramer. 

ELAINE

No! Not me pal. I can't keep this up much longer. I'm sick of being single. I'm getting out. 

JERRY

So it's just gonna be me and Kramer. 

ELAINE

Yep! just you and Kramer. 

JERRY

See you ... me and Kramer... 

KRAMER

Hey!! Buddy. I thought of a great invention for driving. A periscope in a car, so you can see the traffic. 

JERRY

(annoyed) How you gonna drive when looking through a periscope? Besides it's not a submarine and there's no room for a periscope in a car. 

KRAMER

Huh! You make a higher roof. 

JERRY

They're not making higher roofs. 

KRAMER

why can't you make a higher roof. 

JERRY

Because it's a stupid idea. No one's gonna go for it. Don't you understand It's stupid ,stupid... 

JERRY

.....Stupid , stupid. 

JEANNIE

Hey! Hey! Look out. (she pulls him back saving his life.) OK!, Are you okay? 

JERRY

Yeah!.. Thanks.Oh! my god you saved my life. 

JEANNIE

Shouldn't there be some kind of reward for that. 

JERRY

oh! thank you. 

JEANNIE

You know you should be a lot more careful crossing the street like that, otherwise you could die.. If that bothers you. 

JERRY

Well I... 

JEANNIE

You see..(points to his collar) To me this is a waste. 

JERRY

What? 

JEANNIE

The shirt you got on under your sweather. It sits for three weeks in your drawer, waiting to come out. and when it finally does . It sticks up only half an inch out of your collar. 

JERRY

I'm Jerry Seinfeld. 

JEANNIE

Jeannie Steinman. 

JERRY

Hey! Same initials . How do you like that? 

JEANNIE

I like it. 

GEORGE

Listen I was talking to Elaine today and she said she'd would really like to be an usher at the wedding 

SUSAN

No. Out of the question. I don't want any women ushers at my wedding and while we're on the subject, Kramer is not an usher either. 

GEORGE

Why not? 

SUSAN

He doesn't even know my name. 

GEORGE

That was an honest mistake. 

SUSAN

Nah! He's too weird he'd fall or something. He'd ruin the whole ceremony. 

GEORGE

Yeah! You're right.. You're probably right. 

SUSAN

Whadda doing? 

GEORGE

(shrugs and lights it up) 

SUSAN

Since when do you smoke? 

GEORGE

(coughs) I've always smoked. 

SUSAN

I've never seen you smoke. 

GEORGE

Oh yeeah.. well , Big smoker... I (coughs some more) gave it up for a while but it was too tough. Y' know.....I got no will power. 

SUSAN

I don't like this one bit. 

GEORGE

Well(coughs) I can't stop now...(coughs) I'm addicted... 

SUSAN

Well you are gonna have to quit. 

GEORGE

Oh my god.... 

WAITRESS

Menus? 

JERRY

No. I know what I want. 

WAITRESS

The usual? 

JERRY

Yeah., 

WAITRESS

And for you? 

JEANNIE

I'll have a bowl of Cheerios , not to much milk. 

WAITRESS

Ok Two bowls of Cheerios. 

JEANNIE

You too.?... 

JERRY

Yeah!!! 

KRAMER

Hey! Did you hear the bank on the corner is offering a 100 dollars if you go in there and they don't greet you with a hello? 

JERRY

Uh! Really .That's nice. 

KRAMER

Now what's with you? 

JERRY

I think I'm in love. 

KRAMER

Oh. Come on. 

JERRY

No it's true. This woman saved my life. I was crossing the street .I was almost hit by a car...and then we talked and.......the whole thing just seemed like a dream. 

KRAMER

If a guy saved your life you'd be in love with him too. 

JERRY

No, no this woman is different , she's incredible. she's just like me. She talks like me, she acts like me. She even ordered cereal at a restaurant. We even have the same initials. Wait a minute, I just realised what's going on. 

KRAMER

What? 

JERRY

Now I know what I've been looking for all these years......myself! (Kramer is speechless) I've been waiting for me to come along and now I 've swept myself off my feet. 

KRAMER

You stop it man.. you're FREAKING ME OUT!!! 

KRAMER

Hey! 

TELLER

Hey! 

KRAMER

Hey! wait a second. You didn't say hello. 

TELLER

Yes I did 

KRAMER

No no you didn't ...Hundred dollars.. I get a hundred dollars. 

TELLER

No, No I said Hello. 

KRAMER

No, No You said Hey! 

TELLER

Well.. Hey! is Hello, same thing. 

KRAMER

The add said that the bank's gonna pay a hundred dollars if you are not greeted with a hello 

TELLER

You're taking that much to literally. Now sir , do you have any business to transact. 

KRAMER

No, I want to speak to the manager. 

TELLER

Well, He's not here right now. 

KRAMER

Then I'll be back. 

ELAINE

So I'm not gonna be an usher? 

GEORGE

No.. 

ELAINE

So I'm nothing. Jerry is best man , Kramer is an usher and I am nothing. 

GEORGE

Well Kramer's not an usher anymore. 

KRAMER

What are you talking about? 

GEORGE

You've been demoted. 

KRAMER

Why? 

GEORGE

Because you called her by the wrong name. 

KRAMER

But she really looks like a Lily 

ELAINE

Jerry ( as they come into the apt.) Jerry, Susan says I can't be an usher at he wedding. 

KRAMER

Yeah. me neither. 

JERRY

(shrugs) Hey George I think I want to bring a date to the wedding 

GEORGE

Who!!? 

JERRY

I just met her, she's incredible. 

ELAINE

Aaawh...This is GREAT!!.....Now I'm gonna be stuck at the singles table with all the losers. 

JERRY

You can go with Kramer 

KRAMER

No , no no no no. Weddings are a great place to meet chicks. I have to be unfettered. 

GEORGE

Do you see what this is turning in to? Do I need this. I have to get out of this thing. 

ELAINE

Did you try the cigarettes? 

GEORGE

Yeah.. They made me sick. 

KRAMER

All right, All right. Lets get down here. You really want to get out of this thing ? 

GEORGE

Yeah... 

KRAMER

All right. I got two words for you; Pre-Nup. 

GEORGE

What does that mean? 

KRAMER

Ask her to sign a pre-nup. 

GEORGE

What does that do? 

KRAMER

Because most women when they're asked to sign a pre-nup are so offended they back out of the marriage. 

GEORGE

They are?... Elaine? 

ELAINE

I wouldn't sign one. 

GEORGE

Pre-nup of course ..Kramer.... 

KRAMER

GEORGE

JERRY

What's wrong with her? 

KRAMER

Everything she thinks. you think. Everything you think she thinks. No I can't take it. I can't take it Jerry. It's too much. It's too much. 

JERRY

Well you can't take her maybe you can't take me either. 

KRAMER

So THAT's how it's going to be 

JERRY

That's how it's gonna be. 

KRAMER

OH! GOD HELP US!!! 

SUSAN

Eurk.. Awful 

MANAGER

KRAMER

Yeah. uh..I was in here the other day and I went up to that teller and he didn't say hello. 

MANAGER

KRAMER

MANAGER

JERRY

GEORGE

Hehehe. .(feebly) 

JERRY

To our future wives....yeah... 

JERRY

Well it's been quite a night I could sure use a cup of coffee. 

JEANNIE

Hey! what's the deal with decaf; how do they get the caffeine out of there and then where does it go? 

JERRY

(weakly) I dunno 

JEANNIE

That's a shame.. 

JERRY

(to waitress) I' ll just have a cup of coffee. 

JEANNIE

Bowl of Corn flakes. 

JERRY

More cereal? that's your third bowl today, you had it for breakfast and lunch. 

JEANNIE

Hey! So what's the deal with brunch, I mean that if it's a combination of breakfast and lunch. How comes there's no lupper or no linner. 

KRAMER

Hey!! Frank just called me. Congratulations. 

JERRY

Thanks , thanks 

KRAMER

Look I'm sorry about before....I mean I'm sure I'll learn to like her, Jerry 

JERRY

Yeah , yeah . 

KRAMER

C'mon , c'mon what's the matter? 

JERRY

I think I may have made a big mistake. 

KRAMER

Oh! Come on. 

JERRY

All of a sudden it hit me, I realized what the problem is; I can't be with someone like me.. I hate myself!! If anything I need to get the exact opposite of me....It's too much. It's too Much I can't take it ...I can't take it!!! 

KRAMER

(mocking) Too bad you got engaged. 

JERRY

Yeah! Too bad. 

JERRY

Hello. Oh! Hi George.......What! ..really! All right I'll call Elaine , we'll meet you down there. 

KRAMER

What happened? 

JERRY

They just took Susan to the Hospital 

JERRY

So she was just lying there. 

GEORGE

Tsss...Yeah.. 

ELAINE

I wonder what happened? 

GEORGE

I don't know....hmmm ha! here's the doctor. 

DOCTOR

Excuse me , Are you the husband? 

GEORGE

Well , not yet.. Fianc&eacute;. 

DOCTOR

Well , I'm sorry.....She's gone. 

GEORGE

.........What's that?... 

DOCTOR

She expired. 

GEORGE

...Are you sure? 

DOCTOR

Yes , of course. 

GEORGE

So.....She's dead? 

DOCTOR

Yes 

GEORGE

...Huh! 

DOCTOR

Let me ask you ; Had she been exposed to any kind of inexpensive glue? 

GEORGE

...Why? 

DOCTOR

We found traces of a certain toxic adhesive commonly found in very low priced envelopes. 

GEORGE

Well she was sending out our wedding invitations. 

DOCTOR

That's probably what did it. 

GEORGE

We were expecting about two hundred people...Well...Thank you , thank you. 

GEORGE

She's ahem....gone 

JERRY

Dead? 

ELAINE

I'm so sorry George 

JERRY

Yeah! me too 

KRAMER

Poor Lily.. 

JERRY

How did it happen? 

GEORGE

Apparently the glue in the wedding invitations was a....toxic. 

ALL

Aah!.. 

KRAMER

Well that's weird 

JERRY

So I guess , you're not getting married? 

GEORGE

(embarrassed with a touch of unrestrained jubilation) Yes. 

JERRY

But.... 

GEORGE

Yeah? 

JERRY

Well , now I'm engaged.. 

GEORGE

Yeah?... 

JERRY

Well I thought we'd both be getting married. 

GEORGE

Hey!.. What can I tell ya. 

ELAINE

All right. (they start to leave except Jerry) 

GEORGE

well humm.. lets get some coffee. 

JERRY

WE HAD A PACT!!! 

GEORGE

Yes I'd like to speak to Marisa Tomei, please? Marisa, Hi it's George Costanza.. I'm the short, funny, quirky bald man you met a little while ago, heh! yeah I was just calling 'cos I wanted you to know that I'm not engaged anymore......well huh, She died....Toxic glue from the wedding invitations.....well we were expecting about two hundred people. Yeah... Anyway.. hum I got the funeral tomorrow but huh.. my weekend is pretty wide open and I was wondering... (dial tone interrupts George)..... Hello...Hello.. 

GEORGE

Well... it's a magnificent stone. 

ROSS

They put it up this morning. 

GEORGE

It's just a magnificent stone. (turns to Jerry) Jerry? 

ROSS

George... we'll leave you alone with her. 

GEORGE

What? 

ROSS

I'm sure there are things you'd like to say. 

GEORGE

No, I-I-I-I'm good. Really. 

GEORGE

Jerry... 

JERRY

Thank you, no. 

GEORGE

(to Susan's stone) ...And then, right after the All-Star Break, we, we just swept the Orioles. Four games. In Baltimore. (adjusts necktie nervously) So... yeah. 

GEORGE

Boy, that was awkward! 

JERRY

I don't mind the cemetery. 

GEORGE

What were you saying to the Rosses over there, anyway? 

JERRY

Oh, I don't know. I told them her death takes place in the shadow of new life. She's not really dead if we find a way to remember her. 

GEORGE

What is that? 

JERRY

Star Trek II. 

GEORGE

(identifying it) Wrath of Khan! 

JERRY

Right. Kramer and I saw it last night. Spock dies, they wrap him up in a towel, and they shoot him out the bowel of the ship in that big sunglasses case. 

GEORGE

That was a hell of a thing when Spock died... 

JERRY

Yeah... 

GEORGE

Well anyway, the, uh... the stone is up, I paid my respects, guess that's it. 

JERRY

So it's over? 

GEORGE

I have mourned for three long months! Summer months, too! Anybody could grieve in January! It's time for George to start being George again. 

JERRY

All right, so uh, let's do something later. How 'bout a movie? 

GEORGE

Yes! Nothing says George like a movie! 

KRAMER

Movie? 

JERRY

Yeah, you in? 

KRAMER

No, no, no, I can't. I got my martial arts class. 

GEORGE

George is going to the movies! (exits) 

JERRY

(to Kramer) So how's your karate class going? 

KRAMER

(pronouncing it 'kar-ah-tay') Karate, Jerry. Karate. The lifetime pursuit of balance and harmony. 

JERRY

...But with punching and kicking. 

KRAMER

Jerry, karate is not here (pointing to the ground). It's here (points to head), and here (points to chest), and here (makes a circle with his hands). 

JERRY

Alright, I gotta go to the airport to pick up Elaine. 

KRAMER

What, she's been away? 

JERRY

She's been in Mexico for six weeks. 

KRAMER

No, I really think you're wrong. We just went to the fireworks the other day. 

JERRY

That was July 4th! 

JERRY

Alright, I'm outta here, and when I get back, I don't want to see you here (points to kitchen), here (points to living room), or here (makes similar circle with his hands). 

ELAINE

It was unbelievable. Six weeks of traveling through Mexico all on Peterman's peso. 

JERRY

Wow. So did you get any good ideas for the catalog? 

ELAINE

Oh, tons! 

JERRY

Anything you couldn't have gotten tearing open a bag of Doritos and watching Viva Zapata? 

ELAINE

(laughs sarcastically) You don't respect my work at all, do you? 

JERRY

No, I don't. 

ELAINE

So what's been going on around this dump? How's your fiancee? 

JERRY

My what? 

ELAINE

Jeannie... your fiancee. 

JERRY

Oh, yeah, that. Well... 

ELAINE

All right. Spill it, Jerome. 

JERRY

There's really not that much to tell. 

JEANNIE

(simultaneously) I hate you! 

JERRY

See ya. 

JERRY

(continuing) No rejection, no guilt, no remorse. 

ELAINE

You've never felt remorse. 

JERRY

I know, I feel bad about that... 

ELAINE

I bet your parents were upset, huh? 

JERRY

Eh. 

ELAINE

You haven't told them yet, have you? 

JERRY

No. 

DUGAN

'So I pressed through the rushes, there below me, the shimmering waters of Lake Victoria...' 

PETERMAN

Oh, for the love of God, man! Just tell me what the product is. 

PETERMAN

No washcloths! 

ELAINE

Well, Mr. Peterman, I've got a really good idea for a hat. It combines the spirit of old Mexico with a little big city panache. I like to call it the Urban Sombrero. 

PETERMAN

(rubbing his neck) Oh, my neck is one gargantuan monkey fist. 

ELAINE

Are you okay, Mr. Peterman? 

PETERMAN

Yes, yes. Go on, go on, go on. 

ELAINE

Well, see, it's... businessmen taking siestas. You know, it's the, uh, the Urban Sombrero. 

ELAINE

Mr. Peterman? 

GEORGE

(inhales deeply) I tell you, Jerry, I'm feeling something. Something I haven't felt in a long time. 

JERRY

Pride? 

GEORGE

No. Autonomy, complete and total autonomy. 

JERRY

Well, you're your own boss now. 

GEORGE

I wanna go to a tractor pull. 

JERRY

Go ahead. 

GEORGE

I am staying out all night! 

JERRY

Who's stopping you? 

GEORGE

I wanna bite into a big hunk of cheese, just bite into it like it's an apple. 

JERRY

Whatever. 

JERRY

Oh God. 

GEORGE

What? 

JERRY

It's Dolores. 

GEORGE

Who? 

JERRY

Mulva. 

DOLORES

Jerry, hi. 

JERRY

Hi, Dolores. George, you remember Dolores? 

GEORGE

Dolores! 

DOLORES

Hi. (to Jerry) I heard you got engaged. 

JERRY

Yes, Dolores, I did. It didn't work out, though, Dolores. 

DOLORES

Oh, that's too bad. You know... we should get together sometime. See ya. 

JERRY

See ya. 

GEORGE

Bye, Dolores. 

GEORGE

I thought Mulva hated you. 

JERRY

Yeah, so did I. You know what? I bet it was the engagement. I've shown I can go all the way. 

GEORGE

All the way? 

JERRY

Not our 'all the way', their 'all the way.' I got the stink of responsibility on me. 

GEORGE

Yeah, and you were engaged for like a minute, I was engaged for a year. 

JERRY

You stink worse than I do! 

GEORGE

I'm feeling something else here, Jerry! 

SECRETARY

Elaine, it's Mr. Peterman on the phone. 

ELAINE

(answers the phone) Hello, Mr. Peterman, how are you feeling? 

PETERMAN

Elaine, I'll be blunt. I'm burnt out. I'm fried. My mind is as barren as the surface of the moon. I can run that catalog no longer. 

ELAINE

What? Well, who's gonna do it? 

PETERMAN

What about you? 

ELAINE

Me? Why me? 

PETERMAN

Why, indeed. 

ELAINE

Mr. Peterman, you can't leave. 

PETERMAN

I've already left, Elaine. I'm in Burma. 

ELAINE

Burma? 

PETERMAN

You most likely know it as Myanmar, but it will always be Burma to me. Bonne chance, Elaine. (to a passerby) You there on the motorbike! Sell me one of your melons! (runs after him) 

ELAINE

Mr. Peterman? 

JERRY

Where? 

ELAINE

Burma. 

JERRY

Isn't it Myanmar now? 

ELAINE

Jerry, he wants me to run the catalog! It's crazy! I can't be in charge! 

JERRY

No, certainly not. 

ELAINE

I mean, I can't give people orders! 

JERRY

No one's gonna listen to you. 

ELAINE

I am not qualified to run the catalog! 

JERRY

You're not qualified to work at the catalog. 

KRAMER

Hey. (notices Elaine) What's wrong? 

ELAINE

Oh, Peterman ran off to Burma, and now he wants me to run the catalog. 

KRAMER

Where? 

JERRY

Myanmar. 

KRAMER

The discount pharmacy? 

ELAINE

Well, I'm just gonna tell him no. I can't run the catalog. 

KRAMER

Whoa, whoa. Can't? When did that word enter your vocabulary? What, is the job too difficult? (Jerry nods) What, you don't have enough experience? (Jerry shakes his head) Oh, you're not smart enough? (Jerry shakes his head) Where's your confidence? (Jerry shrugs his shoulders) Look, Elaine, let me tell you a story. When I first studied karate... 

ELAINE

Karate? 

KRAMER

Yeah, karate. I had no support. Not from him, not from Newman, no one. The first time I sparred with an opponent, I was terrified. My legs, they were like noodles. But then I looked inside, and I found my katra. 

ELAINE

Katra? 

KRAMER

Yeah, your spirit, your, uh, being. The part of you that says, 'Yes, I can!' 

JERRY

Sammy Davis had it. 

KRAMER

So I listened to my katra and now <vreep> I'm dominating the dojo. I'm class champion. 

ELAINE

Well, you know, I, I have watched Peterman run the company. 

KRAMER

Sure you have. 

ELAINE

I know how to do it. Pair of pants, a stupid story, a huge markup. I can do that. 

KRAMER

You follow your katra, and you can do anything. (leads her to the door) Now get out of here. 

ELAINE

(excitedly) Okay. 

KRAMER

That kid is gonna be all right. 

JERRY

No, she's not. 

JOEY

Come on, Kramer! 

KRAMER

Hey there. 

JOEY

Come on. Mom's down in the car. 

KRAMER

Okay, Joey. 

JERRY

You guys both have class at the same time? 

KRAMER

No, we're in the same class. 

JERRY

What do you mean you're in the same class? 

KRAMER

He almost beat me. 

JERRY

Kramer, you're fighting children?! 

KRAMER

We're all at the same skill level, Jerry. 

JERRY

He's nine years old! You don't need karate, you can just wring his neck! 

KRAMER

I got carpool. (exits) 

KRAMER

Thanks for the juice box, Mrs. Z. 

JOEY

Hey, could we stop for ice cream on the way home, mom? 

ZANFINO

Mmm, I don't know... 

ZANFINO

All right. 

KRAMER

Yay! 

DUGAN

*You're* taking the job? 

ELAINE

You got that straight. Now I want four new ideas from each of you by 6:00. No, make that six ideas by 4:00. All right, let's move, move, move, move, move! 

SANSEI

Are you prepared for kumite? 

JOEY

Yes, Sansei. 

SANSEI

Fight stance. 

SANSEI

Hydjama! Begin! 

SANSEI

(raising Kramer's arm) Winner! 

GEORGE

It's open! 

GEORGE

(surprised) Rosses. 

ROSS

Hello, George. 

GEORGE

Well, uh... come in, come, come in. (frantically clears the couch of newspapers and crumbs) 

ROSS

We, uh, tried to call, but the line was busy. 

GEORGE

Oh. Oh. Yeah, sure. Here. Uh, sit down. Uh, uh, cheese, there? (he grabs a suit jacket from the desk chair and puts it on) 

ROSS

We know the last three months have been hard on you. 

GEORGE

Oh, yes, yes, yes. Very, very hard. 

ROSS

And they've been hard on us, too. It's a terrible tragedy when parents outlive their children. 

GEORGE

Yes, I agree. I hope my parents go long before I do. 

ROSS

That's why we decided to create a foundation to preserve Susan's memory. 

GEORGE

Oh, that's wonderful. 

ROSS

And, of course, we want you to be an integral part. 

GEORGE

Yes, inte-- h-how inte-- how integral? 

ROSS

You'll be on the board of directors. 

GEORGE

(feigning excitement) Great, great. O-Oh, oh, oh, gosh. You know, it's just... my duties with the Yankees... 

ROSS

Don't worry, George. The foundation will revolve around your schedule. Evenings, weekends, whenever you have free time. 

GEORGE

I can't believe this is happening. 

ROSS

Well, it wouldn't have without your friend Jerry's inspirational words. He said to us, 'She's not really dead if her shadow is...' Uh, w-what was it, dear? 

ROSS

Something about a way, a-and a light, uh... ha. Who the hell knows? 

ROSS

Well, what's important is that your relationship with Susan doesn't have to end. 

ROSS

So will you be sure to thank Jerry for us? 

GEORGE

(feigning happiness) The second I see him. 

JERRY

Hey. 

GEORGE

Hey. How's your day, good? 

JERRY

Actually, yeah. I'm meeting Mulva here in a few minutes. 

GEORGE

So uh... Wrath of Khan, huh? 

JERRY

Yeah. Was that a beauty or what? 

GEORGE

What was that line again? Something about finding your way in a shadow? 

JERRY

No, no, no, it's... 'She's not really dead if we find a way to remember her.' 

GEORGE

That's it. That's the line... (squirts mustard into Jerry's coffee and stirs it) ...that destroyed my life. 

JERRY

(stares into coffee cup and looks back at George) Problem? 

GEORGE

The Rosses have started up a foundation, Jerry, and I have to sit on the board of directors. 

JERRY

Hey, board of directors. Look at you! 

GEORGE

Yeah! Look at me! I was free and clear! I was living the dream! I was stripped to the waist, eating a block of cheese the size of a car battery! 

JERRY

Before we go any further, I'd just like to point out how disturbing it is that you equate eating a block of cheese with some sort of bachelor paradise. 

GEORGE

Don't you see? I'm back in. 

JERRY

All because of Wrath of Khan? 

GEORGE

Yes! 

JERRY

Well, it was the best of those movies. 

GEORGE

KHAN! 

WYCK

George. 

WYCK

George. (taps him on the shoulder) 

GEORGE

(startled) Oh! 

WYCK

I'm Wyck Thayer, chairman of the Susan Ross Foundation. 

GEORGE

Wink. 

WYCK

(correcting him) Wyck. 

GEORGE

Wyck. 

WYCK

Now, as you know, the Rosses had considerable monies. 

GEORGE

Oh. I know they have some monies. 

WYCK

They had more than some monies. Many, many monies. And they planned to give a sizable portion of their estate to you and Susan after the wedding. 

GEORGE

So, if Susan and I had... I mean, if the envelopes hadn't, uh... then we-- 

WYCK

Yes. 

GEORGE

And now? 

WYCK

Not. It's all been endowed to the foundation, even this townhouse. 

GEORGE

This townhouse? 

WYCK

This would have been your wedding gift. 

GEORGE

And now? 

WYCK

Not. 

GEORGE

Not. 

WYCK

Also endowed. George... I know how much Susan meant to you. It can't be easy. 

GEORGE

You know, it really can't. 

DOLORES

So who broke it off? 

JERRY

Well, that's the thing. It was completely mutual. 

DOLORES

Oh, come on. Everybody knows there's no such thing as a mutual breakup. Tell me the truth. 

JERRY

I am. It was the world's first. 

DOLORES

You know, when I heard you got engaged, I thought *maybe* you had matured. But obviously there's no growth here. (exits) 

JERRY

Well, I can't argue with that, but the fact remains... I was completely... (to himself, cursing her) Mulva! 

JERRY

(answering) Hello? 

SECRETARY

Please hold for Elaine Benes. 

JERRY

Oh, I don't believe this. 

ELAINE

(picking up) Jerry! 

JERRY

Hey! 

ELAINE

Hey. Guess who just finished laying out her first issue of the J. Peterman Catalog. 

JERRY

How's it look? 

ELAINE

(muffled, as she's smoking a cigar) It's a peach. 

JERRY

Huh? 

ELAINE

I say, it's a peach. 

JERRY

Elaine, let me ask you something. When I told you my breakup was mutual, did you believe me? 

ELAINE

No, no, no. It's weak. No one's gonna buy it, and you shouldn't be selling it. 

JERRY

I gotta do some research here. 

ELAINE

Hey, hey. Me. Talking. You know, between you and me, I always thought Kramer was a bit of a doofus, but he believed in me. *You* did not. So as I see it, he's not the doofus. *You* are the doofus. 

JERRY

Oh, I'm the doofus? 

ELAINE

Yeah. You, Jerry, are the doofus. 

JERRY

You know, it occurs to me that Kramer is at karate right now. 

ELAINE

Oh, well, maybe I'll just go down there and thank him in person. 

JERRY

Yeah, that's what I was thinking. 

ELAINE

Kramer! 

KRAMER

Oh, hey. 

ELAINE

What are you doing? 

KRAMER

Oh, well, I-I-I'm dominating. 

ELAINE

You never said you were fighting children. 

KRAMER

Well, it's not the size of the opponent, Elaine, it's, uh, the ferocity. 

ELAINE

This is what you used to build me up? This is where you got all that stupid katra stuff? 

KRAMER

No, no. That's from, uh, Star Trek III... The Search for Spock. 

ELAINE

Search... for Spock?! 

KRAMER

Yeah, I know Jerry will tell you that The Wrath of Khan is the better picture, but for me, I always... 

ELAINE

(pushes him) You doofus! 

JERRY

Okay, question #8. What if I told you my fiancee left me for another man? Does that make me more likable, less likable, as likable? Let's start over here this time. 

RUTHIE

Same. 

WILLIE

Are we about through here? 

KRAMER

I thought you said your mom was meeting us in the alley. 

JOEY

She had a little change of plans. 

KRAMER

What's going on? Hey, Timmy, Clara. That was some kind of workout we had tonight, huh? 

GIRL

Now we finish it. 

KRAMER

Aah! Aah! Mama! 

JERRY

(on the phone) Dad, I wouldn't eat anything you caught in that pond out in front of the condo. 

JERRY

Uh, look, Elaine's here, I gotta get going. Oh, by the way, uh, I'm not getting married. Tell mom. Bye. (hangs up) 

JERRY

So... did you stop by the dojo? 

ELAINE

Yep. 

JERRY

How's your confidence level? 

ELAINE

Shot. 

JERRY

Self-esteem? 

ELAINE

Gone. 

JERRY

Doofus? 

ELAINE

(raises her hand) Yo. 

JERRY

All right, so what? You put out the catalog. How bad could it be? 

JERRY

What is that? 

ELAINE

It's the Urban Sombrero. I put it on the cover. 

JERRY

Well, nobody sees the... cover. 

KRAMER

God! 

JERRY

What happened to you? 

KRAMER

Whew! I got whooped. You should have seen the rage in their little eyes. And those tiny little fists of fury. Oh. (notices the Urban Sombrero) What is that? 

JERRY

It's the new cover of the J. Peterman Catalog. It is Elaine's choice. Let's congratulate her. 

KRAMER

Oh I see. (Elaine walks up to him) Woof! 

ELAINE

(pointing a finger accusingly at Kramer) You! This is all your fault! You told me I could run the company! 

KRAMER

Well, then I was way off! 

ELAINE

Well, I'll see ya... (exits) 

JERRY

Vaya con dios. 

KRAMER

(with his forehead in his hands) Man, I gotta go lay down. You and George going out a little later? 

JERRY

No, he's still stuck at the foundation. 

KRAMER

You know, you oughta go down there and help him out. He's a widower. 

JERRY

Widower? Wait a second. (goes to a notebook of his research) 

WYCK

Okay, let's see. The beachhouse. 48 acres... ooh. Southampton. That should fetch a fair price. 

GEORGE

Would I have had access to that? 

WYCK

Of course, it would have been yours. 

GEORGE

And now? 

GEORGE

(anticipating the answer) Not. 

GEORGE

Hello? 

JERRY

Hey, Georgie! I'm doing some research down at the coffee shop. Your story's the one. 

GEORGE

My story? 

JERRY

Yeah, your widower story's tested through the roof. (various patrons give the thumbs up in approval) When are you getting out of there? 

GEORGE

Uh, excuse me, Wyck. Uh, are we, uh, almost done here? 

WYCK

(chuckling) Oh, no, not even close. 

GEORGE

(remorsefully) I can't go. 

JERRY

What do you mean you can't go? There's two really girls sitting at the counter eating grilled cheese. Cheese, George! Cheese! 

WYCK

Okay, next item. Susan's doll collection. Estimated value: $2.6 million. What do you say we go through this doll by doll? 

GEORGE

You want me to find a poem about Susan? May she rest in peace?! 

GEORGE

I like, uh...(mutters something unintelligible under his breath.) 

WYCK

Pardon? 

GEORGE

(mutters it again) 

WYCK

Well, you should choose the poem since you knew Susan best at the time of her unfortunate (clears his throat)...accident. 

JERRY

He cleared his throat? 

GEORGE

Yes! 

JERRY

So? 

GEORGE

He did it right as he said 'her unfortunate accident.' 

JERRY

Not getting it. 

GEORGE

Jerry, a throat-clear is a non-verbal implication of doubt - he thinks I killed Susan! 

JERRY

Oh, help me, Rhonda. 

GEORGE

What time is it? 

JERRY

1:15. 

GEORGE

Right now? 

JERRY

I gotta go meet Pam. 

GEORGE

Oh, the bookstore girl. How's that goin'? 

JERRY

Okay. I'm just not ga-ga over her. For once I'd like to be ga-ga. 

GEORGE

Where's Elaine? 

JERRY

She's having Carol, Gail and Lisa over. You know they all have kids now? 

GEORGE

What's with all these people having babies? 

JERRY

Perpetuation of the species. 

GEORGE

Yeah! Right! 

JERRY

By the way, just for the record - 

GEORGE

No, I did not! (They exit the coffee shop.) 

CAROL

...but because it comes out of your baby, it smells good! 

ELAINE

Well, that's...that's sweet. 

GAIL

Being a mother has made me feel so beautiful. 

CAROL

Elaine, you gotta have a baby! 

ELAINE

Oh, hey, you know...I had a piece of whitefish over at Barney Greengrass the other day... 

LISA

Elaine. Move to Long Island and have a baby already. 

ELAINE

I really like the city. 

CAROL

The city's a toilet. When's the last time you saw my little Adam? 

ELAINE

Uh, it was in the Hamptons. 

CAROL

Oh! I have pictures! 

ELAINE

No, no, that's okay, it's uh... 

CAROL

Look at him! Just look at him! 

JERRY

So, Elaine was telling me about this piece of whitefish she had the other day... 

GEORGE

Do you really think I'm wrong about this Wyck guy? 

JERRY

You know, if you really want to test him out, why don't you try the old Jerry Lewis trick? 

GEORGE

Jerry Lewis? 

JERRY

I heard that when Jerry Lewis left a meeting, he'd purposefully leave a briefcase with a tape recorder in it. Then after five minutes, he'd come back for it and listen to what everyone said about him. 

GEORGE

That's pretty paranoid. 

JERRY

Yes, it is. 

GEORGE

I like it! 

JERRY

I thought you might. 

PAM

Oh, hi! I'm Pam. You must be Kramer. (Kramer is smitten with Pam and grins goofily.) Jerry's told me a lot about you. (Kramer continues grinning.) Well, I'm supposed to meet Jerry, it's my day off. I work in a bookstore. 

KRAMER

Books. (Knocks over a bowl of fruit on the counter.) 

PAM

Oh, careful! (Jerry enters.) 

JERRY

Hi, sorry I'm late. 

PAM

That's okay. Kramer let me in. 

JERRY

You know, if we rush, we can still make the movie. 

PAM

Okay. (Touches Kramer's hand) It was really nice meeting you. 

KRAMER

I'm in trouble, buddy. I just met a woman. 

NEWMAN

Go on. 

KRAMER

Well, she's Jerry's girlfriend. 

NEWMAN

Ah, yes. Forbidden love. 

KRAMER

She works in a book shop. Her name is Pam. 

NEWMAN

'Pam.' I don't know the woman, but she sounds quite fetching. 

KRAMER

I can't even speak in front of her. (Sits down on the couch.) 

NEWMAN

Jerry! What could she possibly see in Jerry? (Walks in front of Kramer and trips over his feet.) 

KRAMER

She has delicate beauty. 

NEWMAN

Jerry wouldn't know delicate beauty if it bludgeoned him over the head. 

KRAMER

And yet, he's my friend. 

NEWMAN

And therein lies the tragedy. For I believe, sadly for you, that there is but one woman meant for each of us. One perfect angel for whom we are put on this earth. 

KRAMER

Aw, that's beautiful, Newman. 

NEWMAN

One winsome tulip we ceaselessly yearn for throughout our dreary, workaday lives! And you, my friend, have found your angel. I can tell. For my heart has also been captured by a breathless beauty - whom I fear I will never possess. 

KRAMER

I thought we were talking about me. 

NEWMAN

Right. Kramer, you have to confront Jerry. 

KRAMER

Confront Jerry? I can't. 

NEWMAN

You must! 

KRAMER

I won't! 

NEWMAN

You will! 

ELAINE

'Elaine, ya gotta have a baby.' Ugh. 

GEORGE

Where are all the poetry magazines? 

ELAINE

The New Yorker has poetry. 

GEORGE

Yes. The New Yorker. 

JERRY

Why do you invite these women over if they annoy you so much? 

ELAINE

They're my friends, but they act as if having a baby takes some kind of talent. 

JERRY

C'mon, you want to have a baby. 

ELAINE

Why? Because I can? 

JERRY

It's the life force. I saw a show on the mollusk last night. Elaine, the mollusk travels from Alaska to Chile just for a shot at another mollusk. You think you're any better? 

ELAINE

Yes! I think I am better than the mollusk! 

KEVIN

I couldn't help overhearing what you were saying. 

ELAINE

Oh, I'm sorry. 

KEVIN

No, no, I think I agree with you. I mean, all this talk about having babies. 

ELAINE

Yeah, like you must procreate. 

KEVIN

Besides, anyone can do it. 

ELAINE

Oh, it's been done to death. (smiles) 

GEORGE

I, uh, should have a poem very soon now. 

WYCK

Are you okay, George? 

GEORGE

No, no, not really. Ever since Susan passed on, I have good days and bad. (Turns the briefcase towards the woman on his left.) Some days, I'm haunted by one word - why. Why Susan? Why wasn't it me licking those invitations? Why am I still here? Well, I gotta run. (Gets up and leaves the meeting.) 

WYCK

...and the stock options for this year look quite, uh... (George returns and retrieves the briefcase.) 

GEORGE

Briefcase. (Shrugs and exits.) 

ELAINE

So, Kevin. If I don't want children, does that make me a bad humanitarian? 

KEVIN

Not at all. 

ELAINE

'Cause, I mean, when you get to know me, you'll see that I'm a pretty good humanitarian. (Waitress comes to the table and pours more coffee.) You are doing a wonderful job, by the way. Thanks a lot. (To Kevin) Right? Am I right? (Kramer walks by.) Kramer. Kramer! Come here, look at my new friend Kevin. (Kramer and Kevin shake hands.) Oh, you got a little, uh... 

KRAMER

Oh, I just had two double-fudge sundaes. 

ELAINE

Oh. Are you alright? 

KRAMER

Yeah, I'll be okay. 

ELAINE

You know, Jerry has one of those every time he bombs on stage. 

KRAMER

Well, I'm sure he'll be sharing his next one with Pam. 

ELAINE

Oh, no...that won't last. 

KRAMER

What do you mean? 

ELAINE

He's not ga-ga. 

GEORGE

Lemme tell you something, that Jerry Lewis? You wonder how some of these people get to the top? It's ideas like this! Brilliant! Hah-hah! (Notices that the briefcase is damaged.) Look at this - what the hell happened? The whole side is damaged here...and the lock is broken. 

JERRY

How long did you leave it up there? 

GEORGE

Five minutes. What the hell happened here? 

JERRY

Play the tape, maybe we'll get a clue. 

GEORGE

I have to rewind it first. (George presses the rewind button on the tape recorder. He and Jerry stand there, waiting impatiently as it rewinds.) Alright, alright. 

JERRY

Is that it? 

GEORGE

Stopped dead. 

JERRY

What do you make of it? 

GEORGE

I don't know. (George sits down at the table. Kramer enters.) 

KRAMER

Jerry. Uh, can we talk? 

GEORGE

Kinda busy here. 

KRAMER

I'd like to talk to Jerry in private. 

GEORGE

Why can't I stay? 

KRAMER

Because it doesn't concern you. 

GEORGE

Well, if it doesn't concern me, then I can stay. (Kramer grabs the back of George's chair, drags him out into the hallway and closes the door.) 

JERRY

So, what's on your mind? 

KRAMER

It's Pam. 

JERRY

Pam? What about Pam? 

KRAMER

I love her, Jerry! 

JERRY

You what? 

KRAMER

I love her! 

JERRY

Is that right? 

KRAMER

Oh, she's uh...she's real. She can bring home the bacon and fry it in the pan. 

JERRY

What does that mean? 

KRAMER

Oh, and that voice! 

JERRY

What about her name? 

KRAMER

Pam? Oh, it's a beautiful name. (Kramer sits on the couch.) Pam. Pam. Pam! 

JERRY

She's got really nice hair. 

KRAMER

Oh, it's incredible. Although, I might replace her tortoise clip with one of those velvet scrunchies. I love those. 

JERRY

You've got really specific tastes. 

KRAMER

Oh, I know what I want, Jerry. 

JERRY

She's got nice calves. 

KRAMER

Oh, she's a dreamboat. But, you don't like her, so... 

JERRY

Maybe I could, you're making some pretty good points. 

KRAMER

No you can't, Jerry. 

JERRY

But I might. 

KRAMER

Oh, no you don't. 

JERRY

Why not? The voice? The calves? The bacon? 

KRAMER

What...? 

JERRY

I think I can! I even like the name! Pam! 

KRAMER

Huh? 

JERRY

Pam! 

KRAMER

Huh? 

JERRY

Pam! 

KRAMER

Huh-yah! (Kramer loses it and runs out past George, who is still sitting in the hallway on a chair.) 

KRAMER

So now he wants her more than ever! 

NEWMAN

Blast! 

KRAMER

What am I gonna do, huh? 

NEWMAN

Don't despair, my friend. (Newman walks in front of Kramer and trips over his feet. Again.) I won't allow your love to go unrequited. Not like mine. 

KRAMER

What, again with you? 

NEWMAN

Sorry. But love is spice with many tastes. A dizzying array of textures...and moments. 

KRAMER

If only I could say things like that around her. 

NEWMAN

Yes... 

ELAINE

Well, I hear three distinct sounds. A low rumple...followed by a metallic 'squink'... 

GEORGE

Yes! Yes, I heard the 'squink'! 

ELAINE

...followed by a mysterious...'glonk.' 

GEORGE

It's baffling, isn't it? 

ELAINE

Well, one question does come to mind. Have you considered just...asking them what happened to the briefcase? 

GEORGE

They would never tell me, Elaine. First of all, they probably think that I killed Susan. Besides, I don't even think they like me. (Jerry comes over to the table.) 

JERRY

That Pam! I am ga-ga over her! 

ELAINE

Ga-ga? When did that happen? 

JERRY

Yesterday. Six-ish. 

ELAINE

Well, maybe we should double. I'm pretty ga-ga myself. 

JERRY

You just met the guy yesterday. 

ELAINE

Yeah, but we have a common goal. 

JERRY

A barren, sterile existence that ends when you die? 

ELAINE

Yeah. 

GEORGE

And you really believe this guy doesn't want to have kids. 

ELAINE

Yeah, of course. 

JERRY

Elaine, a guy'll say anything to get a woman. 

ELAINE

Oh, please. He wouldn't say that. 

GEORGE

Elaine, I once told a woman that I coined the phrase, 'Pardon my French.' 

JERRY

I once told a woman that I don't eat cake 'cause it goes right to my thighs. 

GEORGE

I once told a woman that I really enjoy spending time with my family. 

NEWMAN

With your looks and my words, we'll have built the perfect beast. (Kramer claps him on the shoulder, then goes to the other side of the aisle to talk to Pam.) 

PAM

Oh, hi! Kramer. 

NEWMAN

Hi. How are you? 

KRAMER

Hi. How are you? 

PAM

I'm great. 

NEWMAN

I too am well. 

KRAMER

I too am well. 

NEWMAN

Do I smell Pantene? 

KRAMER

Do I smell? 

NEWMAN

Pantene! 

KRAMER

Uh, Pantene. 

PAM

Oh, my shampoo. Yeah, it is Pantene, I got a free sample in with my junk mail. 

KRAMER

Well, there really is no junk-mail...well, everybody wants to get a check or a birthday card, but... 

NEWMAN

...it takes just as much man-power to deliver it as their precious little greeting cards... 

KRAMER

Newman! (Elbows him through the books. Newman falls over.) 

PAM

What? 

KRAMER

Uh, human. It's...human to be moved by a fragrance. 

PAM

That's so true. 

KRAMER

Her bouquet cleaved his hardened... 

NEWMAN

Shell. 

KRAMER

...shell. And fondled his muscled heart. He embibed her glistening spell...just before the other shoe...fell. 

PAM

Kramer, that is so lovely. 

KRAMER

It's by an unknown 20th-century poet. 

PAM

Oh, what's his name? 

KRAMER

Newman. (On the other side of the bookcase, Newman preens proudly.) 

KEVIN

Elaine, you've changed my life. 

ELAINE

Oh, Kevin...you can go on and on about how you don't want kids...and it sounds, it sounds really nice, but...the truth is, I don't know if you mean it or not. 

KEVIN

I got a vasectomy this morning. 

ELAINE

Although, I have a hunch you mean it. 

JERRY

I just came by to tell you - I'm really, really happy about this relationship. Really happy. 

PAM

Oh. Well, that's um...(clears her throat)...nice. (Jerry looks suspicious. Pam turns around and Jerry notices her tortoise clip has been replaced with a velvet scrunchie.) 

JERRY

Kramer! 

JERRY

Hello, Newman. 

NEWMAN

Hello, Jerry. How's Pam? 

JERRY

Pam? What do you care? (Newman shrugs. Jerry notices he's carrying a Brentano's bookstore bag.) 

NEWMAN

Well, ta-ta! (Scampers away.) 

JERRY

Wait a minute! (A manic chase scene ensues, with Jerry chasing Newman from one end of the building to the other. Jerry finally catches up with him in the hallway on another floor.) 

JERRY

Alright, Newman! This is it! (Shoves him against the wall.) 

NEWMAN

Easy, Jerry. Steady. You wouldn't want to lose your cool at a time like this. 

JERRY

Why not? 

NEWMAN

Because right now, I'm the only chance you've got. (Newman giggles nervously. Jerry makes Newman flinch, and his giggling is choked off.) 

JERRY

C'mon. (They exit.) 

JERRY

I can't believe I'm losing Pam! 

NEWMAN

I know how you feel. For I, too, have a woman for whom I pine. 

JERRY

I thought we were talking about me. 

NEWMAN

Right. 

JERRY

Anyway, I don't need your help. (Turns to leave.) 

NEWMAN

Oh, don't you? Joke boy? You really think you can manipulate that beautiful young woman like the half-soused nightclub rabble that lap up your inane 'observations'? 

JERRY

Alright, Newman. What do I have to do to get you to stop pulling the strings for Kramer? 

NEWMAN

Well, there is a little something you can do for me... 

JERRY

C'mon, out with it. 

NEWMAN

It's about...Elaine. 

JERRY

Elaine? What does she have to - (notices Newman looking up at him longlingly.) Oh no... 

NEWMAN

You dated her. Give me some inside information. Anything I can use! 

JERRY

Well, I know she doesn't want to have kids. (Newman considers the implications of this.) 

KEVIN

I thought you'd be a little more enthusiastic about it. 

ELAINE

I know, I don't want...(clears her throat)...kids. 

KEVIN

What was that? 

ELAINE

Well, Kevin, maybe I have a little doubt. I mean, nothing is a hundred percent. 

KEVIN

This is! Oh boy, I always do this. 

ELAINE

What? 

KEVIN

Oh, I get all jazzed up about something and I go way to far with it. 

ELAINE

Really? 

KEVIN

Oh, yeah. Like last summer. I'm watchin' TV and I saw one of those jet-skis. $4000 later and it's sitting in my garage. 

ELAINE

You know, that's weird, actually, 'cause I'm sort of the same way. I mean once for like, no reason, I flattened my hair and I had all these strands hanging in my face all the time... 

KEVIN

Sometimes I think I do want kids. Maybe a lot of kids! 

ELAINE

Sometimes I think about wearing my hair real short. 

KEVIN

Yeah! I think I like short hair. Really short. 

ELAINE

Yeah! 

KEVIN

Yeah! 

GEORGE

This is a crude mock-up of the conference room. 1/14th scale. 

JERRY

When did you build this thing? 

GEORGE

Yesterday, took the day off. (Picks up a red Power Ranger action figure from the model and pretends it's him.) Now, from the time I left the room... 

JERRY

Wait, that's you? 

GEORGE

Yeah. 

JERRY

I really think the M&M should be you. 

GEORGE

Alright, whatever! Now. Whatever caused the damage...(drops a tiny briefcase onto the table in the model)...was jarring enough to completely stop the tape. 

JERRY

And? 

GEORGE

Okay. That's what we know. 

JERRY

But we already knew that. 

GEORGE

Well, yeah. 

JERRY

Just give me some idea of what you think it could be. 

GEORGE

I don't know if you're ready for it. 

JERRY

Please. 

GEORGE

I believe that I am about to become the target of a systematic process of intimidation and manipulation, the likes of which you have never - 

JERRY

Hold it, hold it! You're right, I'm not ready for this. (The door buzzer sounds, Jerry answers it.) Yeah? 

SPEAKER

It's Pam. 

JERRY

C'mon up. (To George) Alright, it's Pam, you gotta get goin.' 

GEORGE

I'm not through here, Jerry. (Picks up the model of the conference room.) I'm gonna keep on investigating. This thing is like an onion. The more layers you peel, the more it stinks. (Pam enters, George leaves.) 

PAM

What was that? 

JERRY

We were just playin.' 

PAM

Listen, I had a long talk with Kramer today... 

JERRY

Uh huh... 

PAM

Well, the thing is, I uh...I think I have a little crush on him. (Kramer slides in the door on his knees.) 

KRAMER

I'm so happy! My world suddenly has meaning! 

JERRY

This is the man you have a crush on? 

PAM

Well, I have feelings for both of you. 

KRAMER

How can you have feelings for him? We're soul mates. 

JERRY

Why can't I be a soul mate? 

KRAMER

Jerry, you really think that Pam would want you to be the father of her children? 

PAM

Children? Who said anything about children? I don't want to have children. 

GEORGE

There are some people in this room who would have been very happy to never see this briefcase again. There are people in this room who think they can destroy other people's property and get away with it. Well, let me tell you something about those people. They weren't counting on this brain! And this tape recorder. 

WYCK

George... 

GEORGE

You'll have your turn! The truth must be heard. (Plays back the tape.) That's all there was. And yet, it speaks volumes. A low rumple. A metallic 'squink.' A 'glonk.' Someone crying out...'Dear God!' Let's start with, uh...with you, Wyck. 

WYCK

George, Quinn here was moving a chair...he lost his balance and dropped it...it must have fallen on your briefcase, which, for some reason, contained a running tape recorder? 

GEORGE

Alright, then. We've gotten to the bottom of that. 

ELAINE

What are you guys doing here? 

JERRY

We're getting vasectomies. 

ELAINE

Why? 

NEWMAN

I'm doing it for you. 

ELAINE

What? 

JERRY

What'd you do to your hair? 

ELAINE

I cut it. 

JERRY

It's a little short. 

KEVIN

Y'think? 

JERRY

What are you doing here? 

ELAINE

Kevin's having his vasectomy reversed. 

NEWMAN

Reversed?! (Kramer comes hobbling out of the doctors office in pain, after having a vasectomy of his own, and exits. Jerry and Newman look at each other, and bolt for the door themselves.) 

GEORGE

...he embibed her glistening spell...just before the other shoe...fell. 

WYCK

Is that a Keats poem? 

GEORGE

No, it's a Newman. Well, I gotta run. (Smiles, pats his briefcase and exits.) 

WYCK

Does anyone think George might have murdered Susan? 

CROSS

Oh, yeah. I just assumed he murdered her. 

BAINES

Of course he killed her. 

WYCK

So it's not just me, then. Alright! Back to business. 

JERRY

All right. How 'bout this one: let's say you're abducted by aliens. 

GEORGE

Fine. 

JERRY

They haul you aboard the mother ship, take you back to their planet as a curiosity. Now: would you rather be in their zoo, or their circus? 

GEORGE

I gotta go zoo. I feel like I could set more of my own schedule. 

JERRY

But in the circus you get to ride around in the train, see the whole planet! 

GEORGE

I'm wearin' a little hat, I'm jumpin' through fire.. They're puttin' their little alien heads in my mouth.. 

JERRY

(resigned) At least it's show business.. 

GEORGE

But in the zoo, you know, they might, put a woman in there with me to uh.. you know, get me to mate. 

JERRY

What if she's got no interest in you? 

GEORGE

W--then I'm pretty much where I am now. At least I got to take a ride on a spaceship. 

KRAMER

George, why couldn't I use the bathroom in that store? 

GEORGE

Kramer, trust me, this is the best bathroom in midtown! 

KRAMER

(frustrated) Wha?? 

JERRY

(dry) He knows. 

GEORGE

(Anyway,) on the left--exquisite marble! High ceilings. An' a flush, like a jet engine! (imitates sound) Ha ha! 

KRAMER

(impressed) Now, listen, uh. You better not wait. I'll catch you later. 

GEORGE

You sure? 

JERRY

(dry) He knows. 

GEORGE

Wow. Nice. 

JERRY

Why don't you try your engagement story? 

GEORGE

(considers, but got into elevator) Won't work. 

JERRY

Are you sure? 

GEORGE

(wry) He knows. 

ELAINE

Look. Kevin. I really like you, heh, heh, uh. But, um, maybe we'd be, better off just being.. friends. (takes a bite of her sandwich) 

KEVIN

Friends? 

ELAINE

Well. I mean. (distracted by the food) Oh, god. This tuna tastes like an old sponge. 

KEVIN

Friends. Yeah! Why not friends? I might like to try that! Like you an' Jerry! 

MAN

(frustrated) Damn thing is jammed again.. 

KRAMER

You know what happens with these? The rollers, they get flat spots on 'em. (hits button several times and whacks it) 

MAN

Come on, let's go. 

KRAMER

(absently wants to be part of it) Oh, yeah--yeah.. (follows them) 

ELAINE

(to JERRY) Remember I was telling you about Gillian, my friend who writes for the L.L. Bean catalogue? I really think you should give her a call. 

JERRY

(doubtful) I don't know, do you have a-- 

JERRY

Not bad. Wuh--what does she-- 

ELAINE

(dry) I put her stats on the back. 

JERRY

Pretty impressive--'Serious boyfriend '92 to '95.' Owns her own car.. 'Favorite president: James Polk!' (ELAINE had echoed: 'Uh-huh. Yup.' during it) 

GEORGE

Hnn! Let me see that. 

JERRY

(hands it to him as he asks ELAINE) So how'd it go with Kevin? Did you, steel-toe his ass back to Kentucky? 

ELAINE

(laughs in appreciation) You are not gonna believe this! I told him that I just wanted to be friends. He's fine with it. He really wants to be friends. 

JERRY

Why would anybody want a friend. 

ELAINE

(dread) Uh. It's really not that bad, actually. He said he'd even go with me to the Museum of Miniatures. This is something you would never ever do. 

JERRY

I mean all that stuff is so small.. ((ELAINE is wryly assessing him)) stupid.. 

GEORGE

(still looking at that picture) You know if I told my engagement story to that receptionist, but told her this, was my fianc&eacute;e.. 

JERRY

What? 

GEORGE

Don't you see. Women like that are like, members of a secret tribe living in a forbidden city. People like me have not been inside in thousands of years.. But with this, it's like I've already been with one of her own! My hands been stamped! I come and go as I please! 

ELAINE

(wry, not impressed) Well you cracked it! I warned the Queen you were gettin' close an', now it looks like we're gonna have to move the whole damn forbidden city. (chuckles with JERRY) 

GEORGE

(getting up) Can I keep this? 

ELAINE

No, I need it. 

GEORGE

(absently leaving with it) Thanks. 

GEORGE

Hi. I'm ah, I'm here to see a Mr. Art Vandelay.. 

AMANDA

I'm sorry sir, there is no Mr. Vandelay here.. 

GEORGE

(taking out wallet) Well, let me. Heh. Let me just eh.. check an', make sure I have the right man--ha! Heh, heh, heh! Seems--oh! I, oh! (has conveniently dropped the photo into her view) 

AMANDA

Oh! She's beautiful! Who is she? 

GEORGE

(humble) Well, if you must know, shhhe, was my fianc&eacute;e, Susan. May she rest in peace. 

AMANDA

Oh, sorry.. She was lovely. I'm Amanda. 

GEORGE

(shaking hands) I'm George. 

KRAMER

You want a drink? I'm buyin'. 

GILLIAN

Jerry? 

JERRY

Gillian. Hiii.. 

GILLIAN

Very nice to meet you. 

JERRY

It's nice to meet you! 

JERRY

She had man-hands. 

ELAINE

(pause) Man, Hands? 

JERRY

The hands of a man. It's like a creature out of Greek Mythology, I mean, she was like part woman, part horrible beast. 

ELAINE

(weary) (Look,) would you, prefer it, if she had, no hands at all? 

JERRY

Would she have hooks? 

ELAINE

Do uh, do hooks make it more attractive, Jerry? 

JERRY

Kinda cool lookin'.. 

ELAINE

(getting up to go) Uh.. Listen, you're picking me up from my (place tomorrow)-- 

JERRY

(leaving too) Yeah. Yeah. 

ELAINE

Okay, I've got five, huge boxes of (buttons). 

JERRY

Right. Well if you need an extra set of hands, I know who you can call-- 

ELAINE

(weary) Jerry! 

JERRY

Kramer?! 

KRAMER

Hey buddy! Hey! 

JERRY

It--eight o'clock in the morning! What the hell is goin' on?! 

KRAMER

Breakfast. I gotta be in at Brand/Leland by nine. 

JERRY

Why?? 

KRAMER

Because I'm workin' there, that's why. 

JERRY

(disoriented) How long have I been asleep? What--what year is this? 

KRAMER

Jerry. I don't know if you've noticed, but lately, I've been drifting, aimlessly? 

JERRY

(snaps fingers) Now that you mention it. 

KRAMER

But I finally realized what's missing, in my life. Structure. An' at Brand/Leland, I'm gettin' things done. An' I love the people I'm workin' with. 

JERRY

How much are they payin' you? 

KRAMER

Oh, no, no, no-no--I don't want any pay. I'm doin' this just for me. 

JERRY

Really. So uh, what do you do down there all day? 

KRAMER

T.C.B. You know, takin' care o' business. Aa--I gotta go. 

JERRY

All right. 

KRAMER

(leaving) I'll see you tonight, huh? (turning back, grabs his briefcase) Forget my briefcase. 

JERRY

W-w-wha' you got in there? 

KRAMER

(as he leaves with it) Crackers. 

JERRY

So the picture worked. Amazing! 

GEORGE

Hey, she wants me to dress uh 'smart casual.' What uh, what is that? 

JERRY

I don't know, but you don't have it. 

GEORGE

Right. Bye. 

ELAINE

Where were you today? 

JERRY

What? 

ELAINE

Pick. Up. 

JERRY

(whispers) Damn. 

ELAINE

So? Where were you?! 

JERRY

Uh, here I guess, an' uh, uh I went out and picked up a paper. 

ELAINE

(irritated, throwing down her bag) I had to ask Kevin, to leave his office an' come an' pick me up! 

JERRY

So? What are friends for? 

ELAINE

Yeah! An' he is a friend, Jerry. He is reliable. He is considerate. He's like your, exact opposite. 

JERRY

So he's Bizarro Jerry! 

ELAINE

(pause) Bizarro Jerry? 

JERRY

Yeah. Like Bizarro Superman. Superman's exact opposite, who lives in the backwards bizarro world. Up is Down. Down is Up. He says 'Hello' when he leaves, 'Good bye' when he arrives. 

ELAINE

(pause) Shouldn't he say 'Bad bye'? Isn't that the, opposite of 'Good bye'? 

JERRY

No. It's still a goodbye. 

ELAINE

Uh. Does he live underwater? 

JERRY

No. 

ELAINE

Is he black.. 

JERRY

Look. Just, forget it, (already). All right? 

KRAMER

Wow. Man. What a day. Could I use a drink. (starts getting a drink and ice) 

JERRY

Tough day at the office? 

KRAMER

Just comin' in, an' that phone just wouldn't stop. 

JERRY

Well, we better get goin' if we're gonna go to that uh, seven o'clock cold fusion. 

KRAMER

Yeah. Well, count me out. I'm swimmin'. Old man Leland is bustin' my hump over these reports. If I don't get 'em done by nine, I'm toast.. ((takes a swig and reacts)) 

GEORGE

This is a fantastic place! I always thought it was a meat packing plant! 

AMANDA

These are my friends. Anabelle, Justina, and Nikki. We used to model together. 

GEORGE

Oh! Modelling! What's that like? Fun? Ha ha. (to self in head) Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! 

AMANDA

So Nikki, uh, how was Paris this time? 

GEORGE

You know, I used to love Paris. My uh, dead Fianc&eacute;e, Susan.. (opening wallet) In fact I. think I, I may have a picture of her.. 

GILLIAN

Would you like some bread, Jerry? 

JERRY

No.. No thanks, I'm, just not hungry. 

GILLIAN

Well, then at least drink your beer.. (she's opening the bottle--brief closeup on hands) 

JERRY

(to self) Oh. Twist off.. 

GILLIAN

You have a little something on your face. 

JERRY

I can get it. (feeling his face) 

GILLIAN

Eh, no-no, No-no.. You're missing it, it's higher. (reaches over) 

GILLIAN

(friendly) It's an eyelash. Make a wish. 

JERRY

I don't want to. 

GILLIAN

Make a wish. 

JERRY

Okay. (closes eyes, blows on her finger, opens eyes, says to self) Didn't come true. 

GILLIAN

(smiles at him) Don't you just love lobster? 

KEVIN

That Museum of Miniatures was amazing. 

ELAINE

I know, he's so tiny! 

KEVIN

Yeah! Hey--hey guys! Elaine, sit down. These are a couple o' my friends. Uh, this is Gene. And this guy, we.. just call 'Feldman!' 

ELAINE

(to self in head) Bizarro world.. 

GEORGE

(delighted) Jerry? It was incredible! Models! As far as the eye could see! 

JERRY

Then it does exist. 

GEORGE

Yes. The legends are true. 

JERRY

So when are you goin' out with this girl again? 

GEORGE

I'm not! I'm inside the walls! 

JERRY

So you're gonna burn that bridge. 

GEORGE

Flame on! 

GENE

(about the check) I got it. 

KEVIN

(grabs it) No. You got it last time. 

GENE

(calmly takes it) Don't worry about it. 

ELAINE

(to self in head) This is unbelievable.. 

FELDMAN

Hey Elaine, what do you think of an alarm clock, that automatically tells you the weather when you wake up? 

ELAINE

Well, I gotta say that I think that that is a fantastic idea, Feldman! 

FELDMAN

Nah, it's not--it's just not practical. 

KEVIN

(getting up) Well. See ya later, Elaine. Feldman an' I 'a' gotta get down 'o the library. (the three guys are leaving) 

ELAINE

What are you gonna do down there? 

KEVIN

Read! 

ELAINE

(pause, then vaguely waves while watching them leave) Hello? 

JERRY

So, uh. Gillian's comin' over later. I think I'm gonna end it. 

KRAMER

Uh-huh. 

JERRY

Those meaty paws, I feel like I'm dating George the Animal, (steer). 

KRAMER

Yeah.. 

JERRY

Maybe I'll chain her to the refrigerator an' sell tickets. 

KRAMER

That's nice.. 

JERRY

Kramer, put the paper down! You never listen to me anymore! We hardly even talk! 

KRAMER

Well, we're, talkin' now, aren't we?-- 

JERRY

I sit here for twenty lousy minutes in the morning-- 

KRAMER

Oh here we go-- 

JERRY

An' then when you come home at night, you're always exhausted--we never do anything anymore! 

KRAMER

What are you starting with me for? You know this is my crazy time o' year?! 

JERRY

(pause) It's your third day.. 

KRAMER

(grabs briefcase to leave) I gotta go to work. We'll talk about this later. (leaves) 

JERRY

Well. (calling down the hall) Call if you're gonna be late! 

ELAINE

What? What is goin' on with you two? 

JERRY

Oh, I don't wanna talk about it.. 

ELAINE

All right, listen. Have you seen my addre-- (sees address book on counter) --ah! There it is. Okay. I got it. I'll see you later. (leaving) 

JERRY

Hey! Wait! Wait! Wait a second! Where you goin'? I-I hardly ever see you anymore. 

ELAINE

(stops, pause) Well, I. (a little ashamed) I guess I been at Reggie's.. 

JERRY

The Bizarro coffeeshop? 

ELAINE

Kevin and his friends are nice people! They do good things. They read.. 

JERRY

I read. 

ELAINE

Books, Jerry. 

JERRY

(pause) Oh. Big deal.. 

ELAINE

Well! I can't spend the rest of my life coming into this stinking apartment every ten minutes to pore over the, excruciating minutia, of every, single, daily event.. 

JERRY

(What's goin' on,) like yesterday, I go to the bank to make a deposit, an' the teller gives me this look, like-- 

ELAINE

I'll see you later man. I gotta go. 

JERRY

(frustrated, to self) The whole system is breakin' down! 

GEORGE

Hello? Amanda. Hi, yes. Listen. You know, I'm thinkin', we might just be better of bein' friends. Yeah. Yeah, you know what, I can't even really talk about it right now. Bye-bye. (hangs up) (happy with himself, but then sees the burned up photo) No! No! 

GILLIAN

Friends. Just friends. 

JERRY

Yeah. 

GILLIAN

Yeah. All right. Well, do you still want to see a movie later? 

JERRY

I wish I could, but, we're friends.. 

GILLIAN

I'm just gonna go, wash my hands. 

JERRY

Good idea. (phone's ringing, goes to it) (muttering) There's a beach towel on the rack.. (to phone) Yeah. 

GEORGE

(frantic) Jerry! Jerry, muh--muh--my hair-dryer ruined the picture! An' I need another one or I can't get back into the forbidden city! 

JERRY

(to drive him crazy) Who is this.. 

GEORGE

Jerry! I need you to get another picture of man-hands. I'm beggin' you! 

JERRY

(pause) If I get it for you, will you take me to that club an' show me a good time? 

GEORGE

Yes! Yes, all right--anything! 

JERRY

Got it. (but now a man-hand grabs his arm) Uh! 

KRAMER

Jerry. Hey Jerry? 

JERRY

I'm right here. (note: he has an athletic bandage on his right hand) You're late. 

KRAMER

Yeah, well, I got held up, you know. What happened to your hand? 

JERRY

Like you care. 

KRAMER

The work piled up, I lost track of time-- 

JERRY

(calmly getting up with plate of chicken) Oh! Sure! Sure! You an' your work! Elaine's off in the Bizarro World, George only calls when he wants something, an' I'm left sitting here like this plate of cold chicken, which, by the way, (drops chicken into sink) was, for two. 

KRAMER

You cooked? 

JERRY

(calm) I ordered in. It's still effort. 

KRAMER

(in pain) Ow! Jeez! 

JERRY

What's wrong? 

KRAMER

(Ow!) It's my stomach. 

JERRY

You're probably gettin' an ulcer. This job is killing you! It's killing Us. 

KRAMER

(putting briefcase down) You know what? You're right. These reports, they can wait a couple of hours. Whadda say we go out tonight? Any place you want. 

JERRY

The coffeeshop? 

KRAMER

You got it, buddy. 

JERRY

(pleased) I'll call George! 

JERRY

Hey. Isn't that Elaine? 

GEORGE

(quiet, desperate) Maybe she can get me another picture of man-hands. (calling) Elaine! 

JERRY

Elaine! 

KRAMER

Elaine! 

THREE

Elaine! Elaine! 

KEVIN

Hey! Elaine! Hi-i! Over here! 

ELAINE

Jerry.. George, Kramer.. This is Kevin, Gene.. and Feldman. 

JERRY

(quietly crept out) This is really weird.. 

ELAINE

(diplomatically to KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN) Could you guys excuse us, just for a moment. 

KEVIN

Sure. (strolls away with his friends) 

ELAINE

(pause) Thanks. (to JERRY, GEORGE, and KRAMER) What.. what do you guys want.. 

GEORGE

Elaine, I got to have another picture of Gillian. 

JERRY

I tried to get him one but Man-Hands almost ripped my arm out of the socket! 

KEVIN

(Here ya are.) 

ELAINE

(pause, turns back to JERRY et al.) Guys. I gotta go. Take it easy. 

GEORGE

Elaine? (she turns, sighing) Can I come? 

ELAINE

I'm, I'm sorry.. We've already got a George.. 

KRAMER

What did you want to see me about, Mr. Leland? 

LELAND

Kramer, I've.. been reviewing your work.. Quite frankly, it stinks. 

KRAMER

Well, I ah.. been havin' trouble at home and uh.. I mean, ah, you know, I'll work harder, nights, weekends, whatever it takes.. 

LELAND

No, no, I don't think that's going to, do it, uh. These reports you handed in. It's almost as if you have no business training at all.. I don't know what this is supposed to be! 

KRAMER

Well, I'm uh, just--tryin' to get ahead.. 

LELAND

Well, I'm sorry. There's just no way that we could keep you on. 

KRAMER

I don't even really work here! 

LELAND

That's what makes this so difficult. 

GEORGE

Hi. George. 

GEORGE

Oh, yeah. Yeah. I used to come here all the time with my fianc&eacute;e, back when it was a meat-packing plant. Ha. Here's her picture. (hands her a magazine page) 

GEORGE

Huh? 

GEORGE

Ha! Heh. 

BOUNCER

Let's go. Private party. (escorts him out) 

KEVIN

Who is it? 

ELAINE

(off-camera) It's Lainey! 

KEVIN

(unlocks, opens door) Hi Elaine! (warmly hugs her) 

ELAINE

Hi (?). Oh! Oh-oh-oh-oh! 

KEVIN

Come on in! 

ELAINE

Okay. Hi Gene! (comfortably tosses her bag to the left, it falls on the floor) Uh-ha! (smiling, picks up her bag, puts it on a chair that's to the right) 

ELAINE

What's up? 

KEVIN

(friendly) Just reading.. 

KEVIN

Hey.. What're you doing? 

ELAINE

Eatin' olives. 

KEVIN

Have you ever heard of asking? (door bell rings) Who is it? 

FELDMAN

(off-screen) Feldman.. From across the hall. 

KEVIN

(drops his suspicion and smiles, goes to door) Hold on. (unlocks and opens door) Hey. 

FELDMAN

He-ey, Kevin! 

KEVIN

Hi. 

FELDMAN

Look who I ran into. 

VARGUS

(testy) Hello, Kevin.. 

KEVIN

(testy) Hello, Vargus.. 

KEVIN

Ya wanna catch a ballgame this weekend? 

VARGUS

Great! I'll see ya later! (leaves) 

KEVIN

Okay. (to self, smiling) Vargus.. (to FELDMAN) So? 

FELDMAN

I got 'em.. 

KEVIN

All right! Hey, Elaine, Feldman was able to get us all tickets to the Bolshoi! 

ELAINE

Oh! (comes to him) 

KEVIN

(enthused) Fourth row, center. 

ELAINE

Get out! (pushes him back, but he falls back on the floor!) 

GENE

(to ELAINE) What is the matter with you? 

ELAINE

Oh, Kevin! I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do? 

GENE

Haven't you done enough already? 

ELAINE

(turning to them, awkward) It's locked.. 

JERRY

So this is it, huh? 

GEORGE

But it--eh.. It was here, I'm tellin' you, an' w--w--it was really here! The, there was, a, bar, and a, an' a dance floor.. 

JERRY

(dry) I guess the DJ booth was over there behind the bone saw? (really disappointed) Let's get out of here George. 

GENE

At work today, I discovered there's a payphone in the lobby that has free long distance. 

KEVIN

Oh, so what did you do? 

GENE

I called the phone company an' immediately reported the error. 

KEVIN

Nice. (doorbell rings) Who is it? 

FELDMAN

(off-screen) Feldman.. From across the hall. 

KEVIN

(smiles, relieved) Hold on. 

FELDMAN

Kevin! Brought some groceries. 

KEVIN

Again?! Feldman, you didn't have to do that! 

FELDMAN

Hey, what are friends for? 

KEVIN

You know, I may not say this enough but you two are about the best friends a guy could have. 

KEVIN

(eyes closed in hug) Oh. Me so happy. Me want to cry. 

KRAMER

I wouldn't walk over there. 

JERRY

Why not? 

KRAMER

It's the most dangerous part of the sidewalk. Cab hops a curb, wap! You've had your last egg sandwich. 

JERRY

What about over there? You know air conditioners fall out all the time. 

KRAMER

I'd much rather get hit by an 80 pound air conditioner than a two ton cab. 

JERRY

No, cab's comin' in right here (Hand at waist) Set of plastic hips, prosthetic legs, and a monkey to answer the door, I'm back in business. 

KRAMER

Much rather take it to the head, Like I did in '79. 

JERRY

You were livin' in the village then, right? 

KRAMER

Don't really remember. 

ELAINE

(Showing fingernails) Toxic waste green. 

JERRY

That is disgusting. 

ELAINE

You know, revulsion has now become a valid form of attraction. 

JERRY

Well, then you're drivin' me wild. 

ELAINE

I had 'em done for the big Peterman bash I'm throwin'. 

JERRY

(George enters) Oh, why you havin' a party? &nbsp; 

ELAINE

I drive my people hard, and then I reward them. 

JERRY

Like with dogs. 

ELAINE

Exactly. 

GEORGE

Party? 

ELAINE

Yeah. 

GEORGE

Food? 

ELAINE

Uh huh. 

GEORGE

Bar? 

ELAINE

Yeah. 

GEORGE

George? 

JERRY

He's gonna show up anyway. 

ELAINE

George, I just don't want you interfering. 

GEORGE

How could I possibly interfere? 

JERRY

Isn't that what Jack Ruby said? 

GEORGE

(Eating) Oh yeah. These are fantastic, fantastic. (To server) You know, I'd love to get a jump on the next batch, where do you come out? (Server leaves) (To Anna) She's been ignoring this section all night. Quesadilla? 

ANNA

No thanks. 

GEORGE

Hi ah, My name is George. 

ANNA

Anna. I don't recall seeing you around the office. Do you work in the mail room? 

GEORGE

No, I'm a friend of Elaine Benes. 

ANNA

Oh. Excuse me. (She leaves) 

GEORGE

So... 

MAN

How 'bout leading us in a toast? 

ELAINE

Oh sure. Hey guys, I wanna make a toast. Um... Here's to us who wish us well, and those who don't can go to hell... All right, who's dancin'? C'mon, who's dancin'? You want me, You want me to get it started? I'll get it started. Whew! (She dances) 

GEORGE

Sweet Fancy Moses! 

KRAMER

You get the tickets? 

JERRY

Who wants two? Special sneak preview of Death Blow. 

KRAMER

Death Blow: When someone tries to blow you up, not because of who you are, but for different reasons altogether. (Jerry buzzes up George) Jerry, do you think you can get an extra ticket for my friend Brody? 

JERRY

Kramer, do you know what I had to go through to get these? 

KRAMER

Yeah, I know, but he's a big fan of the genre. You know I'd consider it a personal favor to me. 

JERRY

Yeah I guess I do owe you. 

KRAMER

Uh, listen, do you want me to stay here until George gets up? 

JERRY

No, I'm okay. 

KRAMER

There's no problem, really. 

JERRY

I'm fine. (George enters, Kramer exits) How was the party? 

GEORGE

Food was good. 

JERRY

Yeah, so I didn't miss anything? 

GEORGE

Well, actually you did miss one nugget of entertainment. (Pause) Have you ever seen Elaine dance? 

JERRY

Elaine danced? 

GEORGE

It was more like a full bodied dry heave set to music. 

JERRY

Did she do the little kicks and the thumbs? 

GEORGE

What, you mean you know about this? 

JERRY

For some time... (video of Elaine dancing on the street with Jerry and the street musicians watching her awful dance) It was about five years ago. I never knew what to say to her about it. It was one of those problems I hoped would just go away. 

GEORGE

Well, sometimes you can't help these people 'til they hit rock bottom. 

JERRY

And by then you've lost interest. 

GEORGE

Hey, you gotta take a ride with me later. I borrowed my father's car. '68 GTO. 

JERRY

What made him get that thing? 

GEORGE

During that period when my folks were separated he went a little crazy. 

JERRY

Not a very long trip. (Enter Kramer) 

KRAMER

Brody's in. 

JERRY

I don't even have the extra ticket yet. 

KRAMER

Well, you better get on the horn. 

ELAINE

I'm tellin' you Jerry I'm gettin' a vibe. If I didn't know better, I'd say the staff completely lost respect for me. (Staff mocks her dancing in the background) 

JERRY

How could that be? 

ELAINE

Jerry, it's like the feeling is palpable. You think it could have something to do with the party? 

JERRY

No, George was there, he said he had a great time. 

ELAINE

Ah, it's George. I bet you this is somehow George related. 

JERRY

Oh, what are you talkin' about? 

ELAINE

He's like a virus. He attaches himself to a healthy host company, and the next thing you know, the entire staff's infected. 

JERRY

Now you're talkin' crazy! 

ELAINE

All right, Jerry, if that's not what it is, you tell me. What is it? 

JERRY

(Makes sound) Oh there's my call waiting, I gotta get goin'. 

ANNA

You have a minute to approve some copy? 

ELAINE

Oh yeah, sure, sure. So ah, did ya have a good time at the party last night? 

ANNA

It was a real... kick. 

ELAINE

Hey, did you happen to speak to my friend George? 

ANNA

As a matter of fact I did. 

ELAINE

Ah hah. Well, listen. You would be wise to keep your distance from him. 

ANNA

Why? He seems harmless. 

ELAINE

Oh he's not. He's very harmful. 

ANNA

Really? 

ELAINE

Oh trust me. He's a bad seed. He's a horrible seed. He's one of the worst seeds I've ever seen. 

ANNA

And you two are friends? 

ELAINE

Yeah, we're good friends. 

GEORGE

So this Anna called me from out of the blue. 

JERRY

Really? I thought you were rebuffed. 

GEORGE

With extreme prejudice. 

JERRY

Maybe Elaine put in a good word for you. 

GEORGE

No, no. That's just the thing. Anna told me that Elaine said I was one of the worst seeds she'd ever seen. 

JERRY

Interesting. She doesn't care for you, then a stern warning, suddenly a phone call. Seems Elaine's made you the bad boy. And Anna digs the bad boy. 

GEORGE

I'm the bad boy. I've never been the bad boy. 

JERRY

You've been the bad employee, the bad son, the bad friend... 

GEORGE

Yes ... yes, yes 

JERRY

The bad fianc&eacute;&Mac226;, the bad dinner guest, the bad credit risk... 

GEORGE

Okay, the point is made. 

JERRY

The bad date, the bad sport, the bad citizen... (looks at table as George exits) The bad tipper! 

JERRY

Half of show business is here. 

KRAMER

There's Brody. Brody! Over here. 

BRODY

Hey Kramer. And you must be Jerry. Thanks for the ticket. 

JERRY

That's quite a feed bag you're workin' on there. 

BRODY

It's for all of us. Is there a problem? 

KRAMER

Brody, c'mon. He's just kidding. He's a joke maker. Tell him, Jerry. 

JERRY

I'm a joke maker. 

KRAMER

All right, here we go, Death Blow. (Brody takes out video camera) 

JERRY

(To Kramer) Hey, hey, what the hell is he doing? 

KRAMER

Relax, he does that all the time. 

JERRY

Does what? 

KRAMER

He's making a copy of the movie for sale on the street, hum? 

JERRY

May I see you outside for a moment please? 

KRAMER

But I want to-- 

JERRY

Outside! 

ELAINE

Hey, have you seen Anna? 

WORKER

Uh, she just went to meet your friend George. 

ELAINE

To meet George? I knew it. Where did they go? 

WORKER

The park, why? 

ELAINE

Don't you see? George is in the bloodstream! You stay away from him, too! 

JERRY

What do you mean he's bootlegging the movie? 

KRAMER

Well, it's a perfectly legitimate business. 

JERRY

It's not legitimate. 

KRAMER

It's a business. 

JERRY

Where did you meet this guy? 

KRAMER

He's a friend of a friend. You know Corky Ramarez up on 94th Street? One day he and I are playing Pachinco-- 

JERRY

Kramer. (boom sound) 

KRAMER

Man, we're missin' the Death Blow! 

JERRY

I don't believe this. (They run into theater) 

ANNA

You know I'm not supposed to be talking to you. 

GEORGE

No one's putting a gun to your head. Do I, uh, scare you? 

ANNA

No... a little. Nice car. 

GEORGE

Yeah, she's a sweet ride. 

ANNA

Is that your orthopedic back pillow? 

GEORGE

Maybe. 

ANNA

Well is it or isn't it? 

GEORGE

Guess not. 

ELAINE

(To George) Stay away from her. 

GEORGE

I didn't do nothin'. 

ELAINE

(To Anna) Get in the car. 

ANNA

But... 

ELAINE

You heard me young lady, get in the car. (To George) And you, you should know better. I don't want you infecting my staff. 

GEORGE

Lighten up. 

KRAMER

Go get 'em, Death Blow! (To Brody) You okay? 

BRODY

Uh, I got a cramp. 

KRAMER

Well, it's no wonder. You ate that entire bag of candy. 

BRODY

Uh, there it goes again. Kramer, you gotta drive me home. 

JERRY

Hey, what is going on over there? 

BRODY

Jerry, finish shooting the movie for me. 

JERRY

Are you nuts? There's no way I'm holding that thing. 

KRAMER

Jerry, if the man is in pain... 

JERRY

Yeah well, maybe if he didn't lick his fingers before he reached in the bag we would've eaten some. Serves him right. 

BRODY

(pulls out a gun) What are you some kind of tough guy? 

KRAMER

Okay. Let's everybody just relax. Jerry, take the camera. 

JERRY

All right, I'm, i,m takin' the camera. 

KRAMER

(To Brody) C'mon, let's go. 

JERRY

Oh man... 

KRAMER

Hey man, so how was the rest of Death Blow? 

JERRY

How was the rest of Death Blow? 

KRAMER

Yeah, who got the final Death Blow, 'cause I thought that Hawaiian guy, he had it comin' to him! 

JERRY

Kramer, you make me get a ticket for this friend of yours and then the guy forces me to bootleg the movie at gun point! 

KRAMER

He's quite a character, isn't he? 

JERRY

You know, he came by here at 3 o'clock in the morning to pick up the tape. I was scared out of my mind! 

KRAMER

I got it. Yep. 

BRODY

Brody. 

KRAMER

Come on up. It's Brody. 

JERRY

What are you, crazy? I don't want to see this guy again. 

KRAMER

Jerry, you did him a favor. He probably wants to come up and thank you. 

JERRY

What if I didn't do it right? 

KRAMER

It's your first time. He'll understand. 

JERRY

People with guns don't understand. That's why they get guns. Too many misunderstandings. 

KRAMER

Hey, Brody! 

JERRY

Hi. 

BRODY

Jerry, I have to talk to you about the tape. 

JERRY

Yeah. 

BRODY

I've never seen such beautiful work. 

JERRY

What? 

BRODY

(con,t) You're a genius. The zoom-ins, the framing. I was enchanted. 

JERRY

Well, I did the best I could. 

BRODY

I got another project for you. It's a movie called Cry Cry Again. I was gonna give it to one of my other guys, but it's an arty movie and quite frankly, they don't have the sensibility. 

BRODY

May I use your phone? 

KRAMER

Uh yeah. It's under the couch. 

KRAMER

Look at you! You've got another gig! Uhh. 

JERRY

I don't want another gig! I'm not doin' this. 

KRAMER

But you have a gift. Jerry, this is not your little comedy act. We're talkin' feature films. 

JERRY

We're talkin' federal crime here. 

BRODY

(To Jerry) I'll expect that tape by three o'clock tomorrow. (To Kramer) May I borrow this? (Holding baseball bat) 

KRAMER

Sure, do you need a glove? 

BRODY

Nah. 

WORKER

I pressed through the rushes and there, the native dancers whirled before me: limbs flailing, arms akimbo, feet kicking up dust... (All workers laugh) 

ELAINE

What? What is so funny? 

ANNA

Sorry, I got hung up. 

ELAINE

At Yankee Stadium? 

ANNA

This? It's mine. 

ELAINE

Oh really? 'Cause it looks a little big for you. It looks like something a short, stocky, slow-witted, bald man might wear. 

ANNA

He's not stocky. 

ELAINE

Who did that? Who did that?!? 

KRAMER

(laughing) The French guy fell off his bike. Oh man, that's precious. (eats popcorn) 

JERRY

No, no, no, no, no, no, no! What were you thinking when you shot this? 

KRAMER

That's fine. 

JERRY

Do you even know what this scene is about? 

KRAMER

It's about a guy buying a loaf of bread. 

JERRY

No, bread is his soul. He's trying to buy back a loaf of his soul. 

KRAMER

Wha? Where? 

JERRY

Kramer there is no way you're giving this tape to Brody and telling him I shot it. 

KRAMER

Nah, nah, he's not going to know the difference. 

JERRY

I don't care about Brody. I was up on 96th Street today, there was a kid couldn't have been more than ten years old. He was asking a street vendor if he had any other bootlegs as good as Death Blow. That's who I care about. The little kid who needs bootlegs, because his parent or guardian won't let him see the excessive violence and strong sexual content you and I take for granted. 

KRAMER

So you'll do the movie? (Jerry watches the movie Kramer shot - we hear Kramer, on the tape say 'Ah man, I sat in gum') 

JERRY

I have to. But I'm gonna need to storyboard this whole thing. Where are my magic markers? 

KRAMER

Right here. (Elaine enters) 

ELAINE

Well, I have lost complete control of my staff. Why did I let George go to that party? I mean, we were having so much fun. We were wining, we were dining, we were dancing. (She starts dancing, Kramer flips out) What? 

KRAMER

(He shows her) This umpf thing. 

ELAINE

It's dancing. 

KRAMER

No, no. That ain't dancing, Sally. 

ELAINE

I dance fine. 

KRAMER

You stink. (He exits) 

ELAINE

He doesn't know what he's talkin' about. (Jerry fake laughs) Jer? Jerry, I'm a good dancer, right? 

JERRY

I forgot to make my bed. (He tries to get away) 

ELAINE

Jerry, do I stink? 

JERRY

All right, you're beyond stink. 

ELAINE

But I really enjoy dancing. 

JERRY

And that's not helpin' either. That's why you're havin' trouble with your staff, not because of George. 

ELAINE

It's that bad? 

JERRY

Have you ever seen yourself? (She starts dancing) Ah, ah, please, please. Not in my home. I gotta go throw this stuff in the laundry. I'll be right back. 

VOICE

I have George Costanza still holding. 

ELAINE

George, hi. I have Anna here. There's something I wanna say to both of you. 

GEORGE

Yo, Anna. 

ANNA

Hi, George. What're you up to? 

GEORGE

(Ironing) You don't wanna know. 

ELAINE

Uh, well, listen. I feel really horrible about trying to keep you two apart and I just wanted to apologize. 

GEORGE

What, wha, what're you talkin' about? 

ELAINE

Well, George, I just want you to hear me say to Anna that you're a good and decent person. 

GEORGE

Pick up the phone, Elaine. Pick it up! 

ELAINE

I never should have given Anna the impression-- 

GEORGE

Pick it up, pick it up! 

ELAINE

--that you're a bad seed, I mean, you're a fine seed. 

GEORGE

Elaine, get off the speaker! (Elaine picks up phone) 

ELAINE

What? 

GEORGE

You are ruinin' everything. 

ELAINE

I'm trying to help. Why are you being so difficult? 

GEORGE

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's it. More of that, difficult. I'm a difficult seed. 

ELAINE

George, I don't have time for this. Uh, Anna, do you wanna talk to George? 

ANNA

Um, no, I don't think so. 

ELAINE

No, she doesn't want to. Okay, bye, George. We'll see ya. 

GEORGE

I'm a bad man! 

BRODY

So where's the tape? 

JERRY

No, I didn't shoot this one. I'm just scouting the location. 

BRODY

I need the tape. 

JERRY

You'll get your tape. But here's what I'm gonna need. I'm gonna need three cameras, two on the floor, one in the balcony. And I want headsets for the guys runnin' 'em. I wanna be able to talk to 'em. 

BRODY

Are you out of your mind? 

JERRY

Kramer... 

KRAMER

I know, Jerry. It's okay. (Jerry steps aside) Yeah, look, Brody. Uh, Jerry wants to do the bootleg. He's dyin' to do it. But if you don't make him happy, the work suffers. And then, nobody's happy. 

BRODY

Just shoot the damn thing so I can get it out on the street! 

JERRY

All right. That's it, I can't work like this. 

KRAMER

Jerry... 

JERRY

I'm off the project. (He exits) 

KRAMER

Jerry! 

BRODY

I want the tape. 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

GEORGE

Well, I'm the good boy again. Can you believe that? 

JERRY

They think they can get anyone to shoot these bootlegs. 

GEORGE

Anna actually has respect for me now. (laughs/snorts) It's all over. 

JERRY

Eh, the whole business has changed. It's all about money now. The sad thing is it's the kids that suffer. (Kramer enters) 

KRAMER

Listen, man. You gotta shoot this movie for me. Brody, he's a reasonable man, but he's insane! 

JERRY

Kramer, I'm not doin' this anymore. I don't know what I was thinking. It's illegal, it's dangerous... 

GEORGE

Did you say dangerous? 

GEORGE

I'm a bootlegger. 

ANNA

You're a what? 

GEORGE

I'm bootleggin' a movie, baby! 

ANNA

Isn't that illegal? 

GEORGE

I can do hard time for this one. And community service! 

ANNA

Is this your FiberCon? 

GEORGE

(Takes it and throws it out window) Get outta my way! 

KRAMER

Jerry, George got arrested. 

JERRY

What? 

KRAMER

Yeah. He went down at the Beackman, he tried to lam, but they cheesed him. 

JERRY

Oh now I see. (Buzzer) Yeah. 

BRODY

Brody, I'm comin' up. 

JERRY

What're we gonna do? 

KRAMER

Well, I ah, gotta give him something. Come on, where's that tape I shot? 

JERRY

I think that's it. (They play it and see Elaine dancing) Sweet fancy Moses! 

KRAMER

Jerry, she taped over the whole ending! (Brody enters) 

BRODY

Where's the tape? 

JERRY

Uh, well. It, uh... 

BRODY

Is that it? 

KRAMER

Uh, yeah, yeah. Here it is, Brody. One copy of Cry Cry Again. 

BRODY

How'd it turn out? 

JERRY

Uh... great. 

KRAMER

Although the whole story kinda comes apart at the end there. 

JERRY

Yeah, out of nowhere there's this lone dancer who appears to be injured. 

KRAMER

Yeah, it's a disturbing image. 

JERRY

Yeah, so you cry... and when you see the dancing, you cry again. 

ANNA

(George is crying) It's all right, George. You'll just pay a fine and that'll be it. 

GEORGE

Why did the policeman have to yell at me like that? (Elaine enters) 

ELAINE

Anna... 

ANNA

Oh, Elaine, thanks for picking me up. I can explain everything. 

ELAINE

All right. Well, we'll talk about it tomorrow at the office. (Mr. Costanza enters) 

FRANK

Okay, where's my boy? 

GEORGE

Oh my God. 

FRANK

I'm sitting at home, reading a periodical, and this is the call I get? My son is a bootlegger? (He hits George in the head) 

GEORGE

Ow! Dad... 

FRANK

Who put you up to this, was it her? 

ELAINE

All right. Wait a minute. I think you've got it backwards. 

FRANK

My George isn't clever enough to hatch a scheme like this. 

ELAINE

You got that right. 

FRANK

What the hell does that mean? 

ELAINE

That means whatever the hell you want it to mean. 

FRANK

You sayin' you want a piece of me? 

ELAINE

I could drop you like a bag of dirt. 

FRANK

You wanna piece of me? You got it! (They begin to fight) 

JERRY

But he's an old man, Elaine. 

ELAINE

Well, he wrote the check, and I cashed it. 

JERRY

(Seeing a street vendor) Hey, it's the bootlegged Death Blow that I shot. 

ELAINE

Oh, Cry Cry Again, I wanna see that. 

JERRY

No you don't. 

MAN

You shot Death Blow? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

MAN

That was brilliant. 

JERRY

Thank you. (They continue walking) 

ELAINE

You were big. 

JERRY

I'm still big. It's the bootlegs that got small. So how are things at the office? Back to normal? 

ELAINE

Yeah, pretty much. Although I still get the vibe every once in a while. 

JERRY

I wouldn't worry about it. (People on sidewalk behind them are doing her dance as they go) 

KRAMER

Well, I really miss the Bermuda Triangle. 

NEWMAN

I guess there's not much action down there these days. 

KRAMER

Oh, there's action. There's plenty of action. That damned alien autopsy is stealing all the headlines. 

NEWMAN

Yeah, tell me about it. 

KRAMER

See, what they gotta do is loose a plane or a Greenpeace boat in there. See, that would get the triangle going again. 

NEWMAN

What keeps the water in there? I mean, why doesn't it disappear? 

KRAMER

What would be the point in taking the water? 

NEWMAN

It's gorgeous water. (pause) Do we own Bermuda? 

KRAMER

No. It belongs to the British. 

NEWMAN

Lucky krauts. 

KRAMER

So, what do you think about that alien autopsy? 

NEWMAN

Oh, that's real. 

KRAMER

I think so too. 

ATTENDANT

The doctor will be with you in a moment.  

ELAINE

Difficult?  

DOCTOR

Elaine. You shouldn't be reading that. So tell me about this rash of yours.  

ELAINE

Well it's, it's..... You know I noticed that somebody wrote in my chart that I was difficult in January of 92 and I have to tell you that I remember that appointment exactly. You see this nurse asked me to put a gown on but it was a mole on my shoulder and I specifically wore a tank top so I wouldn't have to put a gown on. You know there made of paper.  

DOCTOR

Well that was a long time ago. How about if I just erase it. Now about that rash......  

ELAINE

But it was in pen. You fake erase.  

DOCTOR

All right Miss Benes. This doesn't look to serious. You'll be fine. 

ELAINE

What are you writing? Doctor.  

SHEILA

Here you go.  

GEORGE

Thanks.  

SHEILA

I hope you got that mustard stain out of your shirt.  

GEORGE

Ohhhhhh  

JERRY

No. All you got to do is jiggle it with this screwdriver.  

GEORGE

Smile  

JERRY

What are you doing?  

GEORGE

I meet this women, Sheila. She works down at the one hour photo pace. She's got this incredible smile. Like she's got extra teeth or something  

JERRY

Extra teeth. I love that look.  

GEORGE

Hey check this out. I go to pick up my pictures and she says ' I hope you got that mustard stain out of your shirt.'  

JERRY

What mustard stain?  

GEORGE

Don't you see. She's looking at my pictures.  

JERRY

Why did you take a picture of a mustard stain?  

GEORGE

That's got nothing to do with it.  

JERRY

I see. She's looking.  

GEORGE

Yesssss.  

KRAMER

Hey, you got to get this thing fixed.  

JERRY

They've tried to fix it. But it keeps coming back the same.  

KRAMER

Would you like a refund?  

JERRY

Well I can't the warranty expired two years ago.  

KRAMER

Would you be interested?  

JERRY

Well how are you going.....  

KRAMER

Would you?  

JERRY

I guess I would.  

KRAMER

Yeah, yeah.  

ELAINE

You are not going to believe what happened to me at the doctors office today.  

JERRY

Not the gown again.  

ELAINE

No, no. I was looking at my chart and it said I was difficult. Why would they write that?  

JERRY

They have gotten to know you.  

ELAINE

Then the doctor writes more stuff down and doesn't even look at my rash.  

GEORGE

Why don't you find a doctor that doesn't know your difficult.  

ELAINE

Oh come on. I'm not difficult. I'm easy.  

JERRY

Why because you dress casual and sleep with a lot of guys.  

ELAINE

Listen to me you little shi........  

GEORGE

Smile.  

DOCTOR

Well Elaine you really didn't have to put on the gown.  

ELAINE

Oh it's my pleasure. I love these. In fact I got one at home. It's perfect when you just want to throw something on.  

DOCTOR

All rightly. Let me just review your history before we begin.  

ELAINE

Where did you get my chart?  

DOCTOR

From your last doctor. It's a standard procedure.  

ELAINE

You know I can tell you my whole history. Let's just.......  

DOCTOR

Okay. Let's take a look. Well that doesn't look to serious. You'll be fine.  

ELAINE

Please, please. It's really, really itchy.  

DANNY

Seinfeld?  

JERRY

Yeah.  

DANNY

I got a package for you. Sign here.  

JERRY

Who's it from?  

DANNY

No return address.  

JERRY

What if I don't want it?  

WORKER

Are you refusing delivery?  

JERRY

Maybe I am.  

DANNY

Why would you do that?  

JERRY

I've never done it before.  

DANNY

Why start now?  

JERRY

Why not?  

DANNY

All right.  

GEORGE

Why did you refuse the package. Everybody loves a package.  

JERRY

I don't know it was weird. Crazy printing. I don't know who it was from.  

GEORGE

What do you think it's a bomb?  

JERRY

It's not totally impossible.  

GEORGE

Oh the ego on you.  

JERRY

Why can't I be bombable?  

GEORGE

Who's going to bomb you. An airline for all the stupid little peanut jokes.  

JERRY

I suppose you think your bombable.  

GEORGE

Hey. There is a couple of people that wouldn't mind having me out of the way.  

JERRY

There's more than a couple.  

GEORGE

Hey. Check these out. I just picked them up from Sheila. She must have loved these.  

JERRY

You don't have a Mercedes.  

GEORGE

I know. I just sort of leaned on it so it would look like it was mine.  

JERRY

The driver seems a little put out.  

GEORGE

No. He was fine with it. Check that out.  

JERRY

Is that Burt Reynolds?  

GEORGE

Wax Museum.  

JERRY

Oh.  

GEORGE

Oh. What is this?  

JERRY

That's a lot of skin.  

GEORGE

This must be Sheila from the photo place.  

JERRY

You can barely see her face.  

GEORGE

She must have slipped it in here.  

KRAMER

I I I  

GEORGE

Photo store Sheila.  

KRAMER

Well hello Photo store Sheila.  

GEORGE

All right. I will see you boys later.  

JERRY

Where are you going?  

GEORGE

To ask her out.  

KRAMER

No, no. Your not playing the game.  

GEORGE

What game?  

KRAMER

She goes to these lengths to entice you and your only response is ' Gee I really like your picture. Would you like to go out on a date with me please. '  

GEORGE

No good?  

KRAMER

George. It's the timeless art of seduction. You got to join in the dance. She sends you an enticing photo, you send her one right back.  

GEORGE

Oh, I don't know.  

KRAMER

Well as you know I've always been something of a photog.  

JERRY

Oh yeah I like this idea.  

LEO

Hey Danny. Hello. How are you?  

DANNY

Hey Leo. Leo what's up with your nephew. He wouldn't except his package.  

LEO

Oh He wants it. He's just trying to be funny. Yeah I'll sign it . 

ELAINE

And then he starts writing on my chart.  

GEORGE

Well why don't you get a hold of it and change what you don't like.  

ELAINE

You can't change your chart. It's your chart.  

GEORGE

I am in and out of my personnel file at work all the time.  

ELAINE

You are!?!  

GEORGE

Hey. I've kept the same job for more than two years. It's not luck. Elaine, have you ever sent a racy photograph of yourself to anyone?  

ELAINE

Yeah. I sent one to everyone I know. Remember my Christmas card.  

GEORGE

Oh yeah the nipple. But besides that. How did you feel about Kramer's work?  

ELAINE

Actually I thought he was very professional.  

GEORGE

So it was a good experience.  

ELAINE

Oh yeah. In fact I like the picture so much I cropped out the nipple and am using as my health club ID.  

GEORGE

Nice.  

ELAINE

Yeah it is nice actually.  

ELAINE

I need to see Dr. Burke right away. This rash is spreading.  

ATTENDANT

He can't see you Miss Benes, he's busy.  

ELAINE

Oh come on. Have some compassion. Okay well I hope it's contagious  

ELAINE

Come on. Move. (elevator doors reopen; Dr. Burke and two orderlies are revealed) Oh hi Dr. Burke. I didn't know if uh....  

BURKE

The chart Miss Benes.  

ELAINE

Oh please no more.  

JERRY

Hey  

GEORGE

Where's Kramer?  

JERRY

He went to get some steak sauce. Why?  

GEORGE

Personal matter.  

JERRY

Hello  

LEO

Jerry! It's your Uncle Leo! Hello!  

JERRY

Hello Leo. You don't have to yell.  

LEO

I got your package.  

JERRY

How did you get my package?  

LEO

What should I do with it?  

JERRY

I don't know what you should do with it.  

GEORGE

Tell him to open it.  

JERRY

I am not going to treat my uncle like a bomb defusing robot.  

LEO

Jerry, Your cousin Jeffrey is in the Parks Production of 'The Mikado'. I want you to go see it with me.  

JERRY

Open the package Leo.  

LEO

Okay. Opening.  

JERRY

Opening.  

ELAINE

So it wasn't a bomb.  

JERRY

No, No bomb.  

ELAINE

Well then what?  

JERRY

Oh stupid Leo was using one of those oven cleaners. He left the canister in there and the pilot light was on. The whole thing blew up.  

ELAINE

But he's okay?  

JERRY

Yeah but the explosion singed off his eyebrows, mustache everything. He's all smooth now. Look's like a seal.  

ELAINE

Yeah I am still holding.  

JERRY

Is this my stereo?  

KRAMER

Hey you got it.  

JERRY

What happened to my stereo? It's all smashed up.  

KRAMER

That's right. Now it looks like it was broken during shipping and I insured it for $400.  

JERRY

But you were supposed to get me a refund.  

KRAMER

You can't get a refund. Your warranty expired two years ago.  

JERRY

So were going to make the Post Office pay for my new stereo?  

KRAMER

It's just a write off for them.  

JERRY

How is it a write off?  

KRAMER

They just write it off.  

JERRY

Write it off what?  

KRAMER

Jerry all these big companies they write off everything  

JERRY

You don't even know what a write off is.  

KRAMER

Do you?  

JERRY

RESNICK

LEO

It was a fireball.  

ELAINE

RESNICK

ELAINE

LEO

You're not my nurse.  

ELAINE

He has good days and bad.  

RESNICK

LEO

Are my eyebrows going to grow back?  

ELAINE

And he's has a bit of a rash.  

RESNICK

Really.  

ELAINE

Yeah.  

RESNICK

Well there's been a bit of that going around lately. Will you excuse me Poloma. I just need to get some ointment.  

ELAINE

LEO

Elaine what about my eyebrows?  

ELAINE

JERRY

ATTENDANT

I am sorry. It looks like the claim has been red flagged. Your under investigation.  

JERRY

Investigation?  

NEWMAN

Hello Jerry.  

JERRY

Hello Newman.  

NEWMAN

Kramer you might as well run along. Jerry might be a while. Suspicion of mail fraud.  

KRAMER

Mail fraud. Your in a lot of trouble buddy.  

RESNICK

I got your ointment. Where's your nurse?  

LEO

She left.  

RESNICK

No need to get angry. Calm down.  

LEO

I am calm.  

RESNICK

Leo I don't care for your demeanor.  

LEO

Demeanor?  

RESNICK

Now your just being difficult.  

LEO

What are you writing?  

GEORGE

So I really liked the pictures I picked up here yesterday.  

SHEILA

I am glad George.  

GEORGE

And here's a roll that I think you may enjoy.  

SHEILA

Great.  

GEORGE

Shall we say an hour.  

SHEILA

Hey Ron I got to go to lunch. Can you do a roll?  

RON

No problem.  

SHEILA

By the way. You know that model that is always in here. She's missing one of her lingerie shots. Have you seen it?  

RON

No.  

NEWMAN

All right. Then let me ask you this. Didn't you find it interesting that your friend had the foresight to purchase postal insurance for your stereo. Huh. I mean parcels are rarely damaged during shipping.  

JERRY

Define rarely.  

NEWMAN

Frequently.  

JERRY

Are we about throw here Newman?  

NEWMAN

It's pretty hot under these lights huh Seinfeld. Pretty....... Hot . 

JERRY

Actually I am quite comfortable.  

NEWMAN

Can I have a sip?  

JERRY

No.  

NEWMAN

Not going to play ball. Huh all right. Admit it that stereo was all ready busted.  

JERRY

You can't prove anything.  

NEWMAN

Is this or is this not your signature?  

JERRY

No in a matter of fact it isn't.  

NEWMAN

Uncle Leo? This case is closed pending further evidence. Jerry.  

ELAINE

Get in there. Get chart. Get out. You got it.  

KRAMER

Yeah let me borrow your scarf.  

ELAINE

This.  

KRAMER

Yeah. All right one chart coming up.  

ELAINE

Okay.  

KRAMER

Bennette right?  

ELAINE

Benes. My last name is Benes you jackass. Yeah.  

NEWMAN

Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry. 

KRAMER

I like what you've done with that.  

ATTENDANT

May I help you?  

KRAMER

Yes, yes. I am Dr. Vanostran from the clinic. I need Elaine Benes chart. She's a patient of mine and she's not going to make it. It's uh very bad very messy.  

ATTENDANT

I see and what clinic is that again?  

KRAMER

That's correct.  

ATTENDANT

Excuse me.  

KRAMER

From The Hoffer-Mandale Clinic in Belgium.  

ATTENDANT

Really?  

KRAMER

The Netherlands?  

ELAINE

Where's my chart? Did you get it?  

KRAMER

No.  

ELAINE

What? What happened?  

KRAMER

I don't know. But now they got a chart on me.  

SHEILA

I don't know where they could be.  

GEORGE

Can't find them. That's marvelous. The dance continues.  

SHEILA

Well if I find them I'll call you.  

GEORGE

And maybe we could go out and do something.  

SHEILA

Sure.  

RON

Hello.  

GEORGE

Hi.  

SHEILA

So the little guy finally asked me out.  

RON

Really?  

SHEILA

Hey I can't find his photo's anywhere.  

RON

Oh you know what happened. Some guy from the Post Office confiscated them. He left his card.  

SHEILA

Newman?  

GEORGE

I don't know what Newman wanted to see me for.  

NEWMAN

Gentlemen, gentlemen. I am so happy to see you both. There is just some inconsistencies I'd like to straighten out.  

JERRY

I'm clean and you know it.  

NEWMAN

Clean? Hardly. This looks like a man that isn't happy with his stereo performance.  

JERRY

Where did you get that?  

GEORGE

I think that's one of mine.  

NEWMAN

It looks like your breaking into it like an otter breaking into a clad.  

JERRY

I don't know about that but I'm sure there is a explanation.  

NEWMAN

Yes. It's called mail fraud. Oohhhh. How I've longed for this moment Seinfeld. The day when I would have the proof I needed to hall you out of your cushy lair and expose to the light of justice as the monster that you are. A monster so vile.....  

GUY

NEWMAN!!  

NEWMAN

There will be a small fine.  

JERRY

Okay.  

GEORGE

Can we go now?  

NEWMAN

Not so fast pretty boy. There is more to this sorted little affair.  

JERRY

Oh my god!!  

NEWMAN

This photo clearly indicates your involvement in some ill-conceived mail order pornography ring.As does this one found in the same disturbing packet.  

GEORGE

OH MY GOD!!!  

NEWMAN

We have some questions we'd like you to answer.  

JERRY

I have some questions of my own.  

SHEILA

Hi. One of your mailmen....... Oh my god, George!?!  

GEORGE

Listen Sheila it's not what you think. I put my trust into the wrong person. He said the key word was tasteful.  

JERRY

The timeless art of seduction.  

GEORGE

SHEILA!!!  

WOMAN

Well I started out working in mortgage bonds, but I just found that so limiting. 

JERRY

My friend Kramer and I were discussing that same thing the other day. He was with Brant-Leland for a while. 

WOMAN

Wow. Well then my mentor suggested that I move into equities, best move I ever made. 

JERRY

Mentor? You mean your boss. 

WOMAN

Oh, no no no, Cynthia's just a successful businesswoman who's taken me under her wing. 

JERRY

Hmm. So Cynthia's your mentor. 

WOMAN

And I'm her prot&eacute;g&eacute;. You must have someone like that. You know, who guides you in your career path. 

JERRY

Well, I like Gabe Kaplan. 

GEORGE

I still don't understand this. Abby has a mentor? 

JERRY

Yes. And the mentor advises the prot&eacute;g&eacute;. 

GEORGE

Is there any money involved? 

JERRY

No. 

GEORGE

So what's in it for the mentor? 

JERRY

Respect, admiration, prestige. 

GEORGE

Pssh. Would the prot&eacute;g&eacute; pick up stuff for the mentor? 

JERRY

I suppose if it was on the prot&eacute;g&eacute;'s way to the mentor, they might. 

GEORGE

Laundry? Dry cleaning? 

JERRY

It's not a valet, it's a prot&eacute;g&eacute;. 

GEORGE

Alright. Listen, I gotta get some reading done. You mind if I do this here? I can't concentrate in my apartment. 

JERRY

(checking out George's textbook) Risk management? 

GEORGE

Yeah. Steinbrenner wants everyone in the front office to give a lecture in their area of business expertise. 

JERRY

Well what makes them think you're a risk management expert? 

GEORGE

I guess it's on my resume. 

JERRY

Hello? 

VOICE

Please hold for Elaine Benes. 

GEORGE

You know what? I can't do this. I can't read books anymore; books on tape have ruined me, Jerry. I need that nice voice. This book has *my* voice. I hate my voice. 

JERRY

So get this book on tape. 

GEORGE

You can't, it's a textbook. 

ELAINE

Hey, Jer. Are you going to this Bob Sacamano party? 

JERRY

Am I going? It was three nights ago. 

ELAINE

What? You're kidding, I just got this invitation today. Oh, I was so excited. It's really a beautiful invitation. 

JERRY

Oh, it was a lovely affair. 

ELAINE

Wait a minute; this postmark is three weeks old. Man, this happens all the time. (Into intercom) Jeanine? Who the hell runs the mailroom? 

JEANINE

Eddie Sherman. 

ELAINE

Alright, send him up here. 

JERRY

You gonna do a little yelling? 

ELAINE

I'm gonna do a little firing. 

JERRY

That is so cool, can you put me on the speaker? 

ELAINE

Oh yeah, sure. (hangs up) Gimme a break. 

JERRY

Hey, Copernicus? 

JEANINE

Eddie Sherman is here. 

ELAINE

Oh, great. Send him in. 

EDDIE

You wanted to see me? 

ELAINE

Eddie. Yes, um, I am so sorry but I'm afraid we're gonna have to... promote you. 

JERRY

So, what did you say? 

ELAINE

Well, I called him all the way up to my office, so I had to tell him something important. So I promoted him. 

JERRY

What? What did you-- 

ELAINE

Copywriter. 

JERRY

He's writing copy? 

ELAINE

Well it can't be any worse than the pointless drivel we normally churn out. 

KRAMER

Yowza yowza. Check it out. 

JERRY

(reading) Jewish singles night? 

KRAMER

I expect you both to be there. 

ELAINE

I'm not Jewish. 

KRAMER

Well neither am I. 

JERRY

Well why are you going? 

KRAMER

I'm not, I'm running it. 

JERRY

What are you talking about? 

KRAMER

Well Lomez, he usually runs it but he's in the Everglades. 

JERRY

Lomez is Jewish? 

KRAMER

Oh yeah yeah yeah. Orthodox, Jerry. Old school. 

ELAINE

(reading) At the Knights of Columbus? 

KRAMER

Yeah, Frank Costanza, he's getting me a room at his lodge. So Jerry, you know I'm really counting on you to come to this. 

JERRY

Kramer, you know, I-- 

KRAMER

No, Jerry, look I'm cooking all the food myself. 

ELAINE

(reading) A tempting schmear of authentic Jewish delicacies. 

KRAMER

Do you like tsimmis? 

ABBY

My mentor says the duck is outstanding here. 

JERRY

I'm not really a duck fan, the skin seems sort of human. 

ABBY

Oh! Look who's here, Cynthia! 

CYNTHIA

Hello, Abby. 

ABBY

Hello. Jerry, this is Cynthia Pearlman, my mentor. 

JERRY

Hello. 

CYNTHIA

Hi Jerry, nice to finally meet you. 

ABBY

Well come join us, we could pull up a chair. 

CYNTHIA

Great, my boyfriend's just parking the car. Actually, Jerry, you 

JERRY

No kidding? 

CYNTHIA

Kenny Bania. 

JERRY

Bania? 

BANIA

Hey, Jerry!! How's it going?! You gonna join us for dinner? The duck here's the best. The best, Jerry. 

GEORGE

Excuse me, I'm sorry to bother you, I noticed that you have a textbook on tape. May I ask where you got that? 

MAN

Reading for the Blind. They can get any book on tape. 

GEORGE

I tell ya, I am hooked on these books on tape. 

MAN

Oh, tell me about it. These things have ruined me for Braille. 

JERRY

Reading for the Blind? 

GEORGE

I take an eye test; I flunk it, the next thing you know I am swinging to the sweet sounds of risk management. 

JERRY

So, I finally met the mentor. 

GEORGE

What's she like? Impressive? 

JERRY

Oh yeah, she's dating Bania. 

GEORGE

Bania? 

JERRY

Yeah. I had to spend two hours at dinner last night with that specimen. 

GEORGE

What did you have? 

JERRY

Chicken, how could she look up to a person who voluntarily spends time with Bania? 

GEORGE

Marsala? 

JERRY

Piccata, if anything I should be dating a mentor and Bania should be setting pins in a bowling alley. 

JERRY

Hey, good luck with that. 

GEORGE

Thank you. 

GEORGE

Dad. 

FRANK

What are you wearing, an athletic sweat suit? 

GEORGE

What are you doing here? 

KRAMER

Well, he came by to pick up his check for the banquet hall. You know I got a hundred and eighty-three responses? Oh, it's gonna be a rager. 

JERRY

Kramer, how are you gonna cook Jewish delicacies for a hundred and eighty-three people? 

KRAMER

Yeah, you're right. That's a lot of pupkitz. Hey Frank, you know anybody who can help me cook? 

FRANK

Cook? No, I don't know any cooks. I don't know anything about cooking! 

KRAMER

What's the matter with him? 

GEORGE

My dad was a cook during the Korean War. Something very bad happened, ever since you can't get him near a kitchen. 

KRAMER

Shell-shocked? 

GEORGE

Oh yeah, but that has nothing to do with it. 

ELAINE

That's good work, guys. That aught to do it for today. 

EDDIE

Wait. You didn't ask me about my ideas. 

ELAINE

Oh, Eddie, well it's your first day. 

EDDIE

I'm ready. 

ELAINE

Oh, okay. 

EDDIT

(reading) It's a hot night. The mind races. You think about your knife; the only friend who hasn't betrayed you, the only friend who won't be dead by sun up. Sleep tight, mates, in your quilted Chambray nightshirts. 

ELAINE

What am I gonna do? He is a disaster. 

JERRY

Well, if he's doing that bad, maybe he's in line for another promotion. 

ELAINE

You know what? You are exactly right. That is what I should do, I should promote him. I'll give him another office on another floor and he can sit there with his nice title and his bayonet and stop freakin' me out. 

GEORGE

Nothing at all. 

DOCTOR

Well George, your vision is quite impaired. If you'll just sign this insurance form, here's a pen. 

GEORGE

You're a very handsome man, by the way. 

JERRY

What the hell is going on here? 

JERRY

What are you doing? 

KRAMER

I got three kitchens going. I got brisket going at Newman's, I got kugel working at Mrs. Zamfino's, this is kreplach. Here, try some of this. 

JERRY

No, I don't want to. 

KRAMER

Eat, eat! You're skin and bones. 

KRAMER

Hah? 

JERRY

Oh, this is awful. 

KRAMER

Jerry, it's kreplach. It's an acquired taste, yeah. 

JERRY

Did you follow the recipe? 

KRAMER

The recipe was for four to six people; I had to multiply for a hundred and eighty-three people. I guess I got confused. 

JERRY

It tastes like dirt. 

KRAMER

Well I also dropped it on the way over. Look I'm in trouble, I got no skills. I can't peel, I can't chop, I can't grate. I can't mince! I got no sense of flavor, obviously. You know, I gotta talk to Frank. 

JERRY

Kramer, you can't talk to Frank. 

KRAMER

No I gotta talk to him, I know that he can help me, Jerry. 

ABBY

I think there's a dead animal in the elevator. 

KRAMER

My stuffed cabbage! 

ABBY

So, great dinner last night. 

JERRY

Yeah, it was alright. 

ABBY

I told Cynthia we'd double with her and Bania Saturday and then catch his act. 

JERRY

No. No, no way, no Bania. 

ABBY

What? 

JERRY

Have you seen his act? He's got a twelve-minute bit about Ovaltine. He's a punk, a patsy, a hack. 

ABBY

Cynthia would not date a hack. 

JERRY

Would. Does. Is. 

ELAINE

Before we get started, I am happy to tell you that Eddie Sherman is no longer writing for this catalog. 

ELAINE

He's upstairs, I made him Director of Corporate Development. 

EMPLOYEE

You promoted him? 

ELAINE

Well, no, I would hardly-- 

EMPLOYEE

I bust my hump ever day. 

ELAINE

Relax-- 

EMPLOYEE

As far as I'm concerned, you and your deranged prot&eacute;g&eacute; can run the catalog by yourselves! I quit! 

ELAINE

Well, hey? Hey. Hey!! 

VOICE

Chapter one. In order to manage risk we must first understand risk. How do you spot risk? How do you avoid risk and what makes it so risky? 

GEORGE

This guy sounds just like me. 

VOICE

To understand risk, we must first define risk. 

GEORGE

This is horrible. 

VOICE

Risk is defined as-- 

GEORGE

(banging the recorder) Stop it! Stop it! 

KRAMER

C'mon Frank, I need you. I mean the war was fifty years ago. 

FRANK

In my mind, there's a war still going on. 

KRAMER

Alright, what happened, Frank? What is it that you can't get over? 

FRANK

Inchon, Korea, 1950. I was the best cook Uncle Sam ever saw, slinging hash for the Fighting 103rd. As we marched north, our supply lines were getting thin. One day a couple of GIs found a crate, inside were six hundred pounds of prime Texas steer. At least it once was prime. The Use date was three weeks past, but I was arrogant, I was brash, I thought if I used just the right spices, cooked it long enough... 

KRAMER

What happened? 

FRANK

I went too far. I over seasoned it. Men were keeling over all around me. I can still hear the retching, the screaming. I sent sixteen of my own men to the latrines that night. They were just boys. 

KRAMER

Frank, you were a boy too. And it was war. It was a crazy time for everyone. 

FRANK

Tell that to Bobby Colby. All that kid wanted to do was go home. Well he went home alright, with a crater in his colon the size of a cutlet. Had to sit him on a cork the eighteen-hour flight home! 

KRAMER

Frank, now listen to me. Two hundred Jewish singles need you. This is your chance to make it all right again. 

FRANK

No. No, I'll never cook again! Never! Now get out of my house!! Get out. Go. 

JERRY

So you saw Bania's act? 

ABBY

He got two minutes into that Ovaltine thing and I just couldn't take it anymore. 

JERRY

I told you, it's like getting beaten with a bag of oranges. 

ABBY

Why is he so obsessed with Ovaltine? 

JERRY

He just thinks that anything that dissolves in milk is funny. 

ABBY

Anyway, Cynthia and I got into this big argument afterwards and I think it's over. 

JERRY

No more mentor? 

ABBY

Looks that way. 

JERRY

Well at least you and I are okay again. 

ABBY

Actually I was kind of thinking that maybe we shouldn't see each other for a while. 

JERRY

Why? 

ABBY

Well I'm feeling a little disoriented. It's just weird for me not to have an advisor. 

JERRY

I can tell you what to do. 

ABBY

No, it's more than that. 

JERRY

I can tell you what to think. 

ABBY

I need someone I can trust. 

JERRY

Oh. 

GEORGE

I got a big problem here, Jerry. The tapes are worthless. 

JERRY

Kind of in the middle of something here, George. 

JERRY

George? 

ABBY

I gotta run anyway. 

JERRY

I can't believe you feel you really need a mentor. 

ABBY

I just need someone who can give me some kind of direction. I'll see ya. 

JERRY

Yeah, see ya. 

JERRY

What's your problem. 

GEORGE

No problem. 

EDDIE

Hey, I think I got something here. The Bengalese Galoshes. 

ELAINE

Oh. 

EDDIE

(reading) It's tough keeping your feet dry when you're kicking in a skull. 

ELAINE

You know, Eddie, that might be just a tad harsh for womenswear. 

EDDIE

Well, I'm not married to it. 

EDDIE

Dewy meadow. 

ESTELLE

Here's your omelet. 

FRANK

It's dry. 

ESTELLE

That's the way I always make it. 

FRANK

Well it sucks. 

ESTELLE

What did you say? 

FRANK

Your meatloaf is mushy, your salmon croquettes are oily and your eggplant parmesan is a disgrace to this house! 

ESTELLE

Well that's too bad, because I'm the only one who cooks around here! 

FRANK

Not any more! Gimme that spatula! I'm back, baby! 

ABBY

And you're sure with your busy schedule you'd have time to take on a prot&eacute;g&eacute;? 

GEORGE

I'll make time, because Abby, I was once like you; wide-eyed, naive, I didn't know the first thing about a subject as fundamental as risk management. 

ABBY

I'm not familiar with that, you'll have to explain it to me. 

GEORGE

I'll tell you what, why don't you read this book and let's just see if you can explain it to me. 

ABBY

Alright. 

GEORGE

Okay. 

BANIA

Hey Jerry. 

JERRY

Oh, hey Bania. 

BANIA

Didja hear what happened? The mentor saw my act. She dumped me. 

JERRY

Oh, that's too bad. 

BANIA

Maybe she's right. Maybe I am a complete hack. I'm the absolute worst. The worst, Jerry. 

JERRY

Well it's just that you got so many things with the milk. You got that Bosco bit then you got your Nestl&eacute;'s Quik bit, by the time you get to Ovaltine-- 

BANIA

You think you can give me a hand with my material? 

KRAMER

Hey. 

FRANK

You still need a cook? 

KRAMER

Oh yeah, come on in, Frank. 

FRANK

Ya got T-Fal? 

KRAMER

Keflon. 

FRANK

No! Follow me. 

BANIA

(reading) Why do they call it Ovaltine? The mug is round. The jar is round. They should call it round tine. That's gold, Jerry! Gold! 

ELAINE

Let's just replace 'hail of shrapnel' and 'scar tissue' with 'string of pearls' and 'raspberry scones'. 

JERRY

George Costanza is your mentor? 

ABBY

Yeah, he's great! I am learning so much. 

JERRY

About what? How to calculate five percent of a restaurant check? 

ABBY

You know what your problem is? You just have no respect for the mentor/mentor relationship. 

JERRY

As a matter of fact, I happen to have a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of my own. 

ABBY

Who? 

JERRY

A Mister Kenneth Bania. 

ABBY

Bania? 

JERRY

I'm gonna mentor this kid to the top. 

ABBY

Huh, well, I don't think I want to date a mentor whose prot&eacute;g&eacute; is a hack. 

JERRY

Well, I don't think I want to date a prot&eacute;g&eacute; whose mentor is a Costanza. 

ELAINE

I don't know how we did it, but there's some kind of chemistry between us, we turned out one hell of a catalog. 

EDDIE

Cool. 

ELAINE

Hey Ed, let me ask you something. What's with the fatigues and all the psychotic imagery? Huh? 

EDDIE

I don't want to talk about it. 

ELAINE

Come on, don't be a baby. 

EDDIE

I went out on a couple of dates with this woman, I thought she really liked me, and then things kind of cooled off. 

ELAINE

That's it? 

EDDIE

Well it's tough meeting somebody you like, let alone somebody Jewish. 

ELAINE

Mm. This food is fantastic. 

JERRY

Have you tried the hamentashen? 

ELAINE

I can't get off the kishkas. 

BANIA

Hey Jerry! 

JERRY

Bania? 

BANIA

I just stopped by to thank you. That risk management stuff you wrote for me? It's killer! 

JERRY

Risk management? 

BANIA

Aw, it's gold, Jerry! Gold! I got all these corporate gigs and even Cynthia took me back. 

WOMAN

So you went from the mailroom to the director of corporate development in two days? 

EDDIE

That's right. 

WOMAN

How much are they paying you? I'll double it. 

KRAMER

Ya know these latkes are going like hotcakes. 

FRANK

Where's the powdered sugar? 

KRAMER

You know Frank, you could take a break. 

FRANK

No breaks. I fell reborn, I'm like a Phoenix rising from Arizona. 

ELAINE

You're quitting? 

EDDIE

I can't churn out that pointless drivel any more. 

ELAINE

Well, you can't quit, you're all I've got. I need you! 

VOICE

Our next speaker is George Costanza on the subject of risk management. 

GEORGE

Ovaltine. Have you ever had this stuff? Why is it called Ovaltine? 

GEORGE

They should call it round tine. You know what I'm talking about. 

WILHELM

(proudly, to the man seated beside him): He's my prot&eacute;g&eacute;. 

FRANK

Noooo!!! Don't eat it! No good!' 

JERRY

Hey, have you seen all these new commercials for indigestion drugs? Pepcid AC, Tagemat HB. 

ELAINE

Ugh, the whole country's sick to their stomach. 

JERRY

Now, you know you're supposed to take these things before you get sick? 

ELAINE

What is this, a 'bit'? 

JERRY

No. 

ELAINE

'Cos I'm not in the mood. 

JERRY

We're just talking. Is this not the greatest marketing ploy ever? If you feel good, you're supposed to take one! 

ELAINE

Yeah, I know that tone. This is a bit. 

JERRY

They've opened up a whole new market. Medication for the well. 

ELAINE

(tired) Alright, are you done with your little amusement? 

JERRY

(hopeful) Then you admit it was amusing? 

ELAINE

It was okay, but move the 'medication for the well' to the front, and hit the word 'good' harder. 

JERRY

(thinking) Great. Thanks. 

ELAINE

So, your firm designed all the furniture in here? 

BRETT

We manufacture it. The original designs are by Karl Farbman. 

ELAINE

(as if she knows) Oh, Farbman. 

BRETT

You know Farbman? 

ELAINE

Mm, love Farbman. 

BRETT

Most people go their whole lives without sitting in a Farbman. 

ELAINE

Wuh, if you call that living. (laughs) Ahaha. 

ELAINE

Wouldn't it be great if Farbman designed shoes? 

ELAINE

Brett? Don't you think that would be great? 

ELAINE

Brett? 

BRETT

(still staring off) After the song, babe. 

ELAINE

Huh? 

BRETT

The song. 

JERRY

So when do I meet this jerk? 

ELAINE

He's not a jerk, Jer. He only works with Karl Farbman. 

JERRY

Who? 

ELAINE

(dismissive) I dunno, some designer. Anyway, Brett is so generous, and sensitive. Last night he was moved just listening to a song. 

JERRY

What song? 

ELAINE

Desperado. 

JERRY

Desperado? 

ELAINE

Uh huh. 

JERRY

And you're still dating him? I tell you who sounds a little desperado. 

JERRY

(pointing toward the guy) See that salesman, twirling that umbrella. 

ELAINE

Uh huh. 

JERRY

I invented that. 

ELAINE

That, had to be invented? 

JERRY

When I started out as a comedian, I sold umbrellas. It was my idea to twirl it, to attract customers. 

ELAINE

(skeptical) Oh hoh, really? Well, why don't we ask him about it? 

JERRY

Elaine. 

ELAINE

Excuse me. Hey, how you doing. Uhm, my, uh, friend here says that he invented that little twirl you're doing. 

JERRY

Elaine, please, it was a long time ago. The man doesn't want a history lesson. 

CLICKY

Teddy Padillac came up with this twirl. 

ELAINE

(looking at Jerry) Ohh. 

JERRY

I know Teddy Padillac. I worked with him on Forty-eighth and Sixth. 

CLICKY

Yeah, that's where he come up with it. 

JERRY

In his dreams. 

ELAINE

Alright, can we (glances at her watch) go? 

JERRY

(to Clicky) By the way, you're doing it too fast. You'll disorient the customers. 

JERRY

It's the twirling that dazzles the eye. 

GEORGE

(pulls a face) I find it disorienting. Who buys an umbrella anyway? Y..you get 'em for free in the coffee shop in the metal cans. 

JERRY

(as if speaking to a moron) Those belong to people. 

KRAMER

Hey. Well. (proffers the envelope) This was downstairs for you. Ker-ching. 

JERRY

(taking the envelope) Oh no, not more checks. They're coming faster than I can sign 'em. 

GEORGE

What checks? 

KRAMER

Oh, you didn't hear? Jerry's a big star in Japan. 

JERRY

I don't know why. There's a one-second clip of me in the opening credits of some Japanese comedy show. 

KRAMER

Yeah, the Super Terrific Happy Hour. 

JERRY

(opening the envelope and pulling out a stack of checks) They run it all the time, and now I'm starting to get all these royalty checks. 

GEORGE

Look at all of those! You're rich! 

JERRY

Naw. Each one is for like twelve cents. It's barely worth the pain in my hand to sign 'em. 

KRAMER

Hey, Jerry, you need any new furniture? 

JERRY

Why? 

KRAMER

(getting a bottle of water out of the fridge) Yeah, well, Elaine's new boyfriend, you know. He's giving me this oversize chest of drawers. It's a Farbman. 

GEORGE

He's giving you furniture? Who is this guy? 

JERRY

Ah, who are any of her losers? 

GEORGE

(dryly) You're on that list. 

GEORGE

Alright, I gotta go home and open up with the house for the carpet cleaners. You know they're doing my whole place for twenty-five dollars. 

KRAMER

Oh, no, no, no. Not the Sunshine Carpet Cleaners? 

EGO

Yeah, you heard of 'em? 

KRAMER

They're a crazy religious cult. The carpet cleaning is just a means for them to get into your apartment. 

GEORGE

So? For a twenty-five dollar cleaning, I can listen to some pointless blather. 

JERRY

I do it, I'm not even getting the cleaning. 

JERRY

Signed over a hundred checks this morning. 

KRAMER

Hello, twelve dollars. 

OH

Excuse me. Would you take picture please? 

KRAMER

(takes camera) Oh, yeah, sure. 

JERRY

I'm gonna ask this guy something. 

JERRY

(to umbrella guy) Hey. Nice twirl you got there. You know who invented that, don't you? 

KRAMER

(to tourists) Hey, are you folks from Japan. 

YAMAGUCHI

Hai. 

OH

Yes. 

KRAMER

(points over to Jerry) You recognise that mug? 

KRAMER

That's the funny face that greets you at the beginning of the Super Terrific Happy Hour. 

OH

Ahh, Super Terrific Happy... 

KRAMER

Ah, yeah. Yeah, that's him. 

OH

What is he doing? 

KRAMER

Well, I don't know. But something super terrific, I'm sure. 

OH

He's funny. 

KRAMER

Oh yeah, very funny. And it wouldn't be impolite to laugh at his antics. 

KRAMER

Yeah. Yeah, that's it. Because everybody laughs at Jerry here in America. 

LEADER

(calling to George) We're pretty much finished. 

LEADER

There's just one more thing. 

GEORGE

(smiling expectantly) Here it comes. 

LEADER

(clears throat) You forgot to sign your check. 

GEORGE

(signs) Sorry. (expectant) You're sure, uh, there isn't anything else? 

LEADER

(flat) No. 

GEORGE

(let down) So, that's it? 

LEADER

Unless you need a receipt. 

GEORGE

(melancholy) I wish that was all needed. Life can be so confusing. I..I'm searching for answers, anywhere. 

LEADER

(flat) Good luck with that. 

JERRY

Hey. 

ELAINE

What's with the claw? 

JERRY

Super terrific carpal tunnel syndrome. 

BRETT

(to Elaine) There's no sign of Kramer. 

ELAINE

Oh, Brett. (indicating) This is Jerry. 

JERRY

Hi. 

BRETT

That's very funny. Elaine told me you were some kinda comedian. 

JERRY

Ah, I'm one kind. 

ELAINE

Have you seen the chest of drawers that Brett gave to Kramer? 

JERRY

The Fleckman. 

BRETT

Farbman. 

JERRY

Right. 

ELAINE

You gotta see 'em. Beautiful. 

JERRY

(not interested) Oh, I'm sure they are. 

BRETT

I'd be happy to get you some if that's what you're driving at. 

JERRY

No. I'm fine, thank you. 

BRETT

Don't worry. It's no charge to you. 

BRETT

Looks like what you really need is a decent desk for writing your skits. 

JERRY

(quiet annoyance) I don't write skits. 

BRETT

(walking back to Elaine) Well, of course you don't. You don't have a proper workstation. I'll fax you over my catalogue. 

ELAINE

Mmm. Brett, uhm, Jerry doesn't have a fax machine. 

BRETT

(quiet) Oops. 

BRETT

Well, I'm sure things'll pick up for you soon. Elaine, maybe we should get going. 

ELAINE

Oh. Jerry, you wanna join us? 

JERRY

Oh, where you going? The coffee shop? 

BRETT

(scoff) Coffee shop? I think we can do a little better than that. You look like you could use a solid meal at a real restaurant. 

JERRY

You look like you could use a... 

ELAINE

(warning) Jerry. 

KRAMER

(reads) Three hundred dollars. Hey, Mr Oh, how much would these run you in Tokyo? 

OH

(thinks for a second) Ahh, about, uh, thirty thousand yen. 

KRAMER

(shocked) Thirty thousand?! These are practically free. 

KRAMER

Giddyup. You're a cowboy now. 

BRETT

I feel terrible about your friend Jerry. He's upset that I gave Kramer that chest of drawers, isn't he? 

ELAINE

Why? Why d'you think he's upset? 

BRETT

How could he not be? Living in that cramped little apartment. And outdated furniture, so terribly... un-Karl Farbman-like. 

ELAINE

(romantic) We're not gonna talk about Karl Farbman all night, are we? 

BRETT

(smiling) I hope not. 

ELAINE

(surprised) Brett? Everything alright? 

ELAINE

(worried) Brett! What is it? Is there someone outside? 

BRETT

Elaine, the song. 

ELAINE

(relieved) Oh. Oh, oh, phew. You know, for a minute there I thought it was like that urban legend about the guy with the hook who's hanging on the fender... 

BRETT

Elaine, could you just not talk for one minute? 

ELAINE

(apologetic, silently mouthed) Sorry. 

JERRY

No spiel? 

GEORGE

(annoyed) Not a peep. They just cleaned the carpets and left. Call themselves a cult! 

JERRY

So you're angry that this bizarre carpet cabal made no attempt to abduct you? 

GEORGE

They could've at least tried! 

JERRY

You know, maybe they thought you looked too smart to be brainwashed? 

GEORGE

Please. 

JERRY

Too dumb? 

JERRY

(impressed) Well! Mack is back in town! Nice duds. 

KRAMER

Konichi-wa. Yeah, it's a gift from my Japanese friends. (sits beside Jerry) They're known as gift-givers. And tonight we're going dancing at the Rainbow Room. 

JERRY

Sounds like you're throwing a lot of their money around. 

KRAMER

Well, Jerry, they're Japanese. I mean, that TV you watch, that sushi you eat, I mean, even that kimono you wear. Where to you think all that money goes, hmm? 

KRAMER

That's right. 

GEORGE

How'd you hook up with these guys? 

KRAMER

Well, they recognised Jerry from the Super Terrific Happy Hour. See now, you should be doing your own show in Japan. Now, they get you. 

JERRY

What kind of show am I gonna do in Japan? 

KRAMER

(to George) Alright, what'd you do with that pilot you did. 

GEORGE

(excited) Yeah, the pilot! 

KRAMER

That's right, I think that had marvellous production values. 

GEORGE

(enthusiastic) And, you know, I do a lotta business with Japanese TV. They broadcast a lot of American baseball. They got an office here in New York! 

JERRY

Forget it! The pilot was awful. It failed. 

GEORGE

(animated) It failed here! Because, here, every time you turn on a TV, all you see is four morons sitting round an apartment, whining about their dates! 

KRAMER

George is right, Jerry. See, here, you're just another apple, but in Japan, you're an exotic fruit. Like an orange. Which is rare there. 

JERRY

You had a date? You went out with my butler?! Who said you could go out with my butler?! 

ELAINE

Well, why do I need your permission? 

JERRY

Because he's my butler. 

GEORGE

(eager) So? What d'you think? 

GEORGE

Ah. You see, the man who was the butler, uh, had gotten into a car accident with Jerry, and because he didn't have any insurance, the judge decreed that the man become Jerry's butler. 

JERRY

No. That's what makes it such a humorous situation. 

SUBTITLE

Are you following any of this? 

SUBTITLE

I'm still trying to figure out why they gave us a bag of oranges. 

GEORGE

Oh, I, uh, I disagree. You've, uh, you've been living in America too long. (indicates the bag of oranges) You've forgotten what it's like to have no oranges. 

SUBTITLE

Again with the oranges 

JERRY

(flexing his fingers) Sorry. My hand is numb. 

GEORGE

(positive) Yes. From endorsing checks for the Super Terrific Happy Hour. (laughs) 

ELAINE

Ah, I think I'm on the outs with Brett. I got shushed during Desperado. 

JERRY

(throws out his hands) What does he listen to? The all Desperado station? 

ELAINE

He is just in his own world when he hears that song. It's like, I'm sitting there in the car, and he's.. out riding fences. 

JERRY

You know, what you need is a song you can share. 

ELAINE

Yes. You're right. We need to find 'our' song. 

JERRY

Okay. So, is there any song that you feel very strongly about? 

ELAINE

(points) I like Witchy Woman. 

JERRY

Witchy Woman? 

ELAINE

You know, Witchy Woman. (sings) 'Ooo-ooh, wit-chay woman'. 

JERRY

(getting it) Ahh. Wit-chay Woman. 

KRAMER

(to Jerry) Hey, man. 

ELAINE

Hey. 

JERRY

Hey. How was the Rainbow Room? 

KRAMER

Uh, well, we, uh, we had to leave early. There was a, uh, slight monetary discrepancy regarding the bill. 

JERRY

Ah. 

KRAMER

Uh, listen, uh, can I borrow some pillows? 

JERRY

What for? 

KRAMER

Yeah, well, uh, my Japanese friends're gonna stay with me. 

JERRY

I thought they all had suites at the Plaza? 

KRAMER

Well, I'm sorry, Jerry, we all don't have checks rolling in like you do. 

JERRY

Well, what about all that money from the kimonos I wear? 

KRAMER

Well, they ran out of it. Manhattan can be quite pricey. Even with fifty thousand yen. 

ELAINE

Fifty thousand yen? Isn't that only a few hundred dollars? 

KRAMER

Evidently. (To Elaine) Oh, by the way, tell Brett that his chest of drawers are a big hit. My guests are very comfortable in them. 

ELAINE

In them?! 

JERRY

You have them sleeping in drawers?! 

KRAMER

Jerry, have you ever seen the business hotels in Tokyo? They sleep in tiny stacked cubicles all the time. They feel right at home. 

JERRY

This has 'international incident' written all over it. 

KRAMER

(smiling) Oh yeah, yeah. 

KRAMER

Goodnight, Mr Tanaka. 

TANAKA

Goodnight. 

KRAMER

Goodnight, Mr Oh. 

OH

(sits up) Goodnight. 

KRAMER

Goodnight, Mr Yamaguchi. 

YAMAGUCHI

(sits up) Oyasuminasai *(Japanese for goodnight) 

JERRY

What is this? 

KRAMER

Rice Crispies. East meets West, Jerry. 

JERRY

Ah. It's a lovely little bureau and breakfast you're running. Well, I'm off to the bank. 

KRAMER

(opening the fridge) Sayonara. 

JERRY

(leaving) Konichi-wa. 

BRETT

Elaine, I... 

ELAINE

Shh-shh! (smiling) What d'you think? 

ELAINE

What are you doing? That's Witchy Woman. That could be our song. 

BRETT

Witchy Woman is okay for you, but I've already got a song. 

ELAINE

Oh. Oh, then how about Desperado? (smiling) We can share it. 

BRETT

(flat) No. It's mine. 

KRAMER

Here you go. Snap, crackle and pop. 

KRAMER

(loudly) Good morning, Mr Oh. I gotta make up the drawer. 

OH

Ach, come back in half hour. 

JERRY

(calls) Hey, I'll take one. 

CLICKY

Well, look who's back! 

CLICKY

Teddy! (indicates Jerry) This's the guy says he invented the twirl. 

TEDDY

(unfriendly recognition) Jerry Seinfeld! 

JERRY

Teddy Padillac. Long time, no see. (pointing at the umbrellas) What've you got in a push-button mini. 

TEDDY

(bitter) Same thing we had, when you bailed on us, fifteen years ago. 

JERRY

Bailed? C'mon, you knew I wanted to be a comedian. Besides, we had some good time. Remember Tropical Storm Renee? 

TEDDY

(angry) Oh, yeah, sure. But where were you during the poncho craze of eighty-four? I almost lost my house. 

CLICKY

Umbrella, buddy? 

CLICKY

Now we got that damn 'urban sombrero' to contend with. 

TEDDY

(to Clicky) Easy, there. (to Jerry) I hear you're taking credit for the twirl. 

JERRY

Aw, it was so many years ago. Who cares? 

TEDDY

(intense) I care. Clicky cares. 

JERRY

So, could I... 

JERRY

Could I just buy an umbrella? 

TEDDY

(sour) Yeah, sure. Two hundred dollars. 

JERRY

(shock) What?! 

TEDDY

(caustically) Special price, for a real foul-weather friend. 

KRAMER

Hey, George. How about that tour, huh? These guys are ready to run the bases. 

GEORGE

(indicating the window) Kramer, it's, it's raining. They got the tarp on the field. 

KRAMER

(quietly) Ah, listen, George, what else can I do with these guys? Now, bear in mind, they're a little light on the yen. 

GEORGE

Well, I, I got the pilot of the Jerry show. 

KRAMER

(snaps his fingers) That's perfect. (to the Japanese) Hey, how would you guys like to watch Super Terrific Happy star Jerry Seinfeld? 

OH

But, we are also very hungry. 

KRAMER

Oh, yeah, yeah. (feeds tape into VCR) Well, you guys just watch the tape and, uh, I'll get you some food. 

KRAMER

(shouts) Hey, peanuts! 

WILHELM

George. (waves George over) George. 

WILHELM

(puzzled) Uh, George, uh, did you call some carpet cleaners? 

GEORGE

Are they here? 

WILHELM

They're in my office, right now. 

GEORGE

(suspicious) They haven't said anything to you, have they? 

WILHELM

About what? 

GEORGE

(to himself, resentful) What kind of a snobby, stuck-up, cult is this?! 

BRETT

(calls over) Hey Jerry! 

JERRY

Oh, hi Brett. 

BRETT

Haven't you ever heard of an umbrella? 

JERRY

Ah, I didn't have enough money. 

BRETT

I'm sure things'll pick up for you. 

JERRY

No, it's not that, it's the... 

JERRY

Oh no, look at the checks! Hours of hard work ruined! 

BRETT

Ah, don't worry, I can spot you the (reads) twelve cents? 

JERRY

No, it's not the money. It's my hand. It's crippled from writing and writing. 

BRETT

Nothing's working for you, is is? 

JERRY

(bitter) Not at the moment, Brett. 

BRETT

I'd give you a ride, but I got Karl Farbman here. 

JERRY

(sarcastic) Thanks for stopping! 

ELAINE

Brett said you ran away from him, as if he were the boogetyman. 

JERRY

Boogeyman. 

ELAINE

Boogey? 

JERRY

I'm quite sure. Anyway, any luck getting together on a song? 

ELAINE

No. He blew out my Witchy Woman, and he won't share Desperado. Hey, what d'you think of Oye Como Va? 

JERRY

(negative) Eehh. 

ELAINE

(desperation) Well, I'm running outta guys here in this city, Jer! 

JERRY

Hey. 

GEORGE

(excited) Great news! I showed the pilot to Kramer's Japanese friends. They loved it! 

JERRY

Really? They bought the butler character? 

GEORGE

(excited) Did I tell you that story's relatable?! That was a great show! That is why I'm bringing it back to NBC. 

JERRY

NBC? 

GEORGE

(little subdued) Nakahama Broadcast Corporation. 

JERRY

Ah. But they told us we must go now. 

GEORGE

But now I have my own market research. Actual Japanese viewers, that love the show! I'm gonna talk to Kramer. 

JERRY

Hey, George, do me a favour. If they make you an offer, whatever it is. (vehement) Just take it! 

GEORGE

Hey, by the way, what'd you think of Miss Yoshimura? 

JERRY

Who? 

GEORGE

The network executive. You think she liked me? 

KRAMER

Heyy! Look who's here. 

KRAMER

(beckoning to George) Come on, I want you to come in here. 

OH

Come on in, fat boy! 

GEORGE

Get a good night's sleep, alright fellas. (thumbs up) Big day tomorrow! 

JERRY

(to himself) Last one. 

JERRY

(agonised) Uugh! Ahh. 

KRAMER

There you are. 

GEORGE

Uh. (smiles) Where's the boys? 

KRAMER

Uh, no, I let 'em sleep in. 

KRAMER

I'm on my way to cash in their plane tickets for them. They need a little food money. 

GEORGE

(horrified) But that meeting starts in ten minutes! 

KRAMER

No, well, I set their alarm. But they did have a lot of sake in that hot-tub. 

GEORGE

(frantic) I'm calling Jerry. 

JERRY

Yeah? 

GEORGE

(panicked and rushed) Jerry! The Japanese guys had sake in the hot-tub! You gotta get 'em outta the drawers and get 'em down here, or I don't have a focus group to sell the pilot to Japanese TV! 

JERRY

(kidding) Uncle Leo? 

GEORGE

(scream) Jerry!! 

JERRY

Alright, alright. I'll wake 'em up. 

JERRY

(to himself) Hmm, testy. 

JERRY

Hello? 

OH

Mr Jerry! Open the drawer, please! 

JERRY

It's stuck. (pained) Oww! The steam from the hot-tub musta warped the wood. 

OH

Pull harder. 

JERRY

I'm trying. I can't get a grip. My hand's had kind of a bad week. 

OH

Very funny, but no joking, please. 

JERRY

(looks round) Don't worry, I'll get you out. 

ELAINE

Brett, believe me. You don't have to do this. 

BRETT

Elaine, I know he'll appreciate this. Granted, it's not as nice as Kramer's cabinet, but it's start. 

ELAINE

Uh, I promise you, Jerry is not jealous of Kramer's cabinet. 

JERRY

(yell) Move to the back of the drawers! 

ELAINE

Jerry? 

ELAINE

Jerry. 

BRETT

(shouting) Not the Farbman!! 

OH

(speaks Japanese) SUBTITLE: Jerry Seinfeld is a dangerous lunatic. He wouldn't let us out of the drawers. Then he came at me with an axe. 

SUBTITLE

We suspect his friend here is also unbalanced. 

GEORGE

So, uh, gentlemen, do we have a deal? 

OH

(speaks Japanese) SUBTITLE: Could we have a couple of those oranges? 

OH

(speaks Japanese) SUBTITLE: We are very hungry and have survived many hardships. 

GEORGE

(to the executives) Excuse me. Did you hire the Sunshine Carpet Cleaners? 

GEORGE

Mr Wilhelm? Wha..what're you doing here? 

WILHELM

I'm here to clean the carpets. Most of the world is carpeted. And, one day, we will do the cleaning. 

GEORGE

(incredulity) Him you brainwashed! (angry shout) What's he got that I don't have?! 

GEORGE

(urgent) Mr Wilhelm, listen. You've been abducted! Please, Mr Wilhelm, you gotta listen to me! 

WILHELM

Wilhelm? (he raises the nozzle of his cleaner) My name is Tanya. 

SUBTITLE

With these two idiots I don't know how the Yankees won the World Series. 

JERRY

(apologetically) Brett, I'm, I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to hit you in the head with.. an axe. 

JERRY

(defensive) At least it was just the handle! 

BRETT

It was a beautiful cabinet. What am I gonna tell... 

BRETT

I can't remember his name! 

JERRY

Fleckman? 

ELAINE

Calm down Brett, okay. You could have a concussion. Calm down. (holds Brett's head and sings) 'Desperado, mmm-mm-mmm. You better...' 

JERRY

(singing) '...let somebody love you. Let somebody love you, before it's too...' 

NURSE

His pulse is fine. 

DOCTOR

Hmm. Looks like a minor concussion. Let me see what I can do to relieve the swelling. 

NURSE

Doctor? 

NURSE

(concerned) Doctor? 

NURSE

(worried) Doctor? 

NURSE

(alarm) Doctor, I think we're losing him! 

SETH

Big investment firm.  

JERRY

Hey buddy. I'm on no sleep, no sleep!. You don't know what it's like in there, all night long things are creaking and cracking. And that red light is burning my brain! 

GEORGE

Say you, me, and Kramer are, uh, flying over the Andes. 

JERRY

Why are we flyin' over the Andes? 

GEORGE

We got a soccer game in Chile. Anyway, the plane crashes. Who are you gonna eat to survive? 

JERRY

Kramer. 

GEORGE

So fast? What about me? 

JERRY

No. 

GEORGE

Kramer's so stringy. I'm plump, juicy. 

JERRY

Kramer's got more muscle, higher protein content. It's better for you. 

GEORGE

Well I would eat you. 

JERRY

That's very nice, I guess. 

GEORGE

I still don't see why you wouldn't eat me. I'm your best friend. 

JERRY

Look, if other people are having some, I'll try you. 

GEORGE

Thank you. 

JERRY

Can I have a piece of that? 

GEORGE

No. 

LOUISE

George, I can't have sex. 

GEORGE

With me or in general? 

LOUISE

I went to the doctor today. I have mono. 

GEORGE

Nucleosis. 

LOUISE

Oh I hope it's not a problem for you. 

GEORGE

No, no, pff... 

LOUISE

How long is this not gonna be a problem for me? 

JERRY

Six weeks? 

GEORGE

Yeah, six weeks. 

JERRY

Well, so what? you've gone six weeks before. 

GEORGE

I can do six weeks standin' on my head. I'm a sexual camel. That's not the point. At least there was the possibility. 

JERRY

Well, so, are you gonna break up with her? 

GEORGE

I don't know. I don't wanna be one of those guys. 

JERRY

What guys? 

GEORGE

Like us. (Elaine enters) 

JERRY

Yeah. 

GEORGE

So it's just mono. 

ELAINE

Mono? Huh, well, if anyone needs any medical advise, Elaine met a doctor. And he's unattached. 

JERRY

I thought the whole dream of dating a doctor was debunked. 

ELAINE

No, it's not debunked, it's totally bunk. 

JERRY

Isn't bunk bad? Like, that's a lot of bunk. 

GEORGE

No something is bunk and then you debunk it. 

JERRY

What? 

ELAINE

Huh? 

GEORGE

I think. (Pause as they all look down) 

ELAINE

Look it, I'm dating a doctor and I like it. Let's just move on. (Phone rings) 

JERRY

Hello? 

KATIE

Jerry. 

JERRY

Oh hi, Katie. 

KATIE

Listen, something just came up for Tuesday at the Dayton Civic Center. That's Ohio, Jerry. 

JERRY

I've heard of Ohio, Katie. But Tuesday's no good. I'm doin' career day at my old junior high. 

KATIE

Okay, Jerry. that's fine. you're the boss. Katie works for Jerry. 

JERRY

Yes, all right, Katie. 

KATIE

Sorry for the late notice. 

JERRY

Yes, bye. 

KATIE

You're the-- (He hangs up) 

GEORGE

They asked you to do career day? 

JERRY

Yeah, it's no big deal. 

GEORGE

Oh with all due respect, I went there too, and I work for a team that just won the World Series. 

JERRY

And you were integral. 

TEACHER

Jerry, it was so nice of you to come down here. 

JERRY

I'm on next, right? 

TEACHER

Well, unfortunately, Mr. O'Meary from the Bronx zoo... 

JERRY

The guy with the lizard. 

TEACHER

Yes. Well, he started feedin' it crickets, and the children just love him. And we're outta time. 

TEACHER

So can you come back tomorrow? 

JERRY

I'm getting bumped? You're bumping me from career day? 

ELAINE

So do most doctors like ER or do you guys just think it's fake? 

BEN

I couldn't tell you. You know, I'm not really a doctor. 

ELAINE

Oh, yeah. And I'm not really attracted to you. 

BEN

Well, I'm serious, Elaine. I went to medical school, but I still have to pass my licensing exam. 

ELAINE

When do you take this exam? 

BEN

I've taken it. Three times. I almost passed the last one. 

ELAINE

Well, you're basically a doctor. Right? I mean, people do call you doctor. 

BEN

Well, um... 

ELAINE

Well, can I introduce you as doctor? 

BEN

Yeah. 

ELAINE

All right, that's all I wanted to know. 

LOUISE

Mono. (George removes hand) 

GEORGE

It was fantastic, Jerry. We wound up talking all night. 

JERRY

So you're enjoying the not enjoying. 

GEORGE

you know, just by conversing, you can really learn a lot about a person. 

JERRY

I'm finding that out. (Kramer enters) 

KRAMER

Hey, buddy. How was career day? 

JERRY

Ah, I didn't get on. The lizard guy went long. 

GEORGE

You got bumped from career day? 

JERRY

It was a mix-up, I'm sure. 

KRAMER

They're trying to screw with your head. 

JERRY

Now why would a junior high school want to screw with my head? 

KRAMER

Why does Radio Shack ask for your phone number when you buy batteries? I don't know. 

GEORGE

Hey, hey. Kramer, what are you doing? You can't smoke in here. 

KRAMER

No, come on. (Larry the cook comes over) 

LARRY

Take it outside. 

KRAMER

Come on, Larry. You know me. 

LARRY

It bothers people, and it's against the law. 

JERRY

You can make all the laws you want, he's still gonna bother people. 

KRAMER

What, did they kick you out too? 

MAN

Yeah, they kicked us all out. 

TEACHER

Thanks so much for coming back, Jerry. Care for a graham cracker? 

JERRY

No, let's just do it. (Fire alarm goes off) What? What is going on? What is that about? 

TEACHER

Fire drill. Sorry. Single file everyone! 

JERRY

But I was promised this slot. 

TEACHER

Single file, Jerry. (Jerry joins the line) 

JERRY

Fire drill, can you believe that? 

GEORGE

What is Pericles? 

TREBEK

Pericles is correct. 

JERRY

Like fire in a school is such a big deal. (Kramer enters) 

KRAMER

Hey, you got any matches? 

JERRY

Middle drawer. 

GEORGE

Who is Sir Arthur Conan Doyle? 

TREBEK

We were looking for 'Who is Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.' 

KRAMER

Thanks. (Kramer leaves, phone rings) 

JERRY

Hello? 

KATIE

Jerry. 

JERRY

Oh hi, Katie. 

KATIE

I heard what happened to the junior high. They can't bump you like that. That is so unprofessional. 

JERRY

Oh relax, Katie. It's not a problem. 

GEORGE

What is Borax? 

TREBEK

Yes, you're right. 

KATIE

They bump you in junior high, the next thing you know you're being bumped in high schools, colleges, trade schools. Before you know it, Letterman's not returning your calls. (Kramer enters) 

KRAMER

Ashtrays? 

JERRY

No, I don't have any ashtrays. 

KRAMER

Ooh, cereal bowls. 

KATIE

Jerry, now don't freak out, I'll take care of it. 

JERRY

No, Katie, don't-- (He hangs up phone) 

KRAMER

All right, thanks. (Kramer leaves) 

GEORGE

What is Tungsten or Wolfram? 

TREBEK

We were looking for 'What is Tungsten, or Wolfram'. 

JERRY

Is this a repeat? 

GEORGE

No, no, no. Just lately, I've been thinking a lot clearer. Like this afternoon, (To television) what is chicken Kiev, (Back to Jerry) I really enjoyed watching a documentary with Louise. 

JERRY

Louise! That's what's doin' it. You're no longer pre-occupied with sex, so your mind is able to focus. 

GEORGE

You think? 

JERRY

Yeah. I mean, let's say this is your brain. (Holds lettuce head) Okay, from what I know about you, your brain consists of two parts: the intellect, represented here (Pulls off tiny piece of lettuce), and the part obsessed with sex. (Shows large piece) Now granted, you have extracted an astonishing amount from this little scrap. But with no-sex-Louise, this previously useless lump, is now functioning for the first time in its existence. (Eats tiny piece of lettuce) 

GEORGE

Oh my God. I just remembered where I left my retainer in second grade. I'll see ya. (He throws finished Rubik's cube to Jerry and he exits. Kramer enters) 

KRAMER

Need some more matches. 

JERRY

What is goin' on in there? 

KRAMER

I met some people smoking on the street, so I invited them up to my apartment to smoke. 

JERRY

Why? 

KRAMER

Well somebody had to. You know, just because a person's a smoker, that doesn't mean he's not a human being. 

JERRY

It doesn't? 

KRAMER

Well you can confine them, you can punish them, you can cram them into the corner, but they're not going away, Jerry. 

JERRY

All right. 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

ELAINE

So when they're handing you those cadavers, do you get to choose whether it's a man or a woman? 

BEN

I dunno. Dead bodies really gross me out. (Sue Ellen Mischke enters with a man) 

ELAINE

Oh my God. 

BEN

What's wrong? 

ELAINE

It's Sue Ellen Mischke, this old braless friend I hate. (Elaine tries to cover her face) 

ELLEN

Elaine? Hi. 

ELAINE

Oh hi, Sue Ellen. 

ELLEN

Oh Rick, this is an old, old, friend of mine, Elaine Benes. Rick is a periodontist. He does Giuliani's gums. 

ELAINE

Well, this is my boyfriend, doctor Ben Gelfen. 

BEN

Well, I'm an intern. 

ELAINE

Hey, stop kidding me. He's a doctor. He's a very good doctor. 

WOMAN

Carlitto's just passed out. Can anyone help? 

ELAINE

Well, there's a doctor right here. 

BEN

No there's not. 

ELAINE

Can't you at least tell him what to do? 

BEN

Like what? 

ELLEN

Shouldn't he elevate his legs? 

BEN

Right. Elevate your legs! 

ELAINE

I hope Carlitto feels better. Ben really wishes he could've helped. 

LARRY

I thought he was a doctor. 

ELAINE

Oh he is. Kind of. I mean, I call him doctor. (She walks away and sees George sitting down reading books) George. (He holds up his hand to signal her to wait a second.) 

GEORGE

Of course. Absolute zero! 

ELAINE

What? What is with all these books? 

GEORGE

I stopped having sex. 

KRAMER

All right, I'll see ya Bill. All right, I got room for two, but the only thing I have is in the non-filter section. (Jerry enters) Hey. 

JERRY

Hey. Wh-What'd you got, a smoker's lounge in there? 

KRAMER

Oh yeah, people really seem to be enjoying themselves. You know, they come in once, it's like they're addicted. (Katie enters) 

KATIE

Jerry, oh there you are. You didn't answer the phone. 

JERRY

I was out. 

KATIE

Oh. Jerry, great news. I got you an assembly. 

JERRY

An assembly? 

KATIE

Two hours in front of the entire junior high, grades six through eight. That's six grade, seventh grade-- 

JERRY

I understand. But what am I gonna talk about for two hours? 

KATIE

And, it is already in the school paper. They cancelled Rick James. 

JERRY

Superfreak? 

KATIE

Yes. 

ELAINE

What is your answer to number 74? 

BEN

Medobolic acidosis. 

ELAINE

No! Hypocalimia, not medibolic acidosis. Duh! 

BEN

Man, I'm never gonna pass this thing. 

ELAINE

Oh yes you are. We'll just stop having sex. 

GEORGE

Guys, hitting is not about muscle. It's simple physics. Calculate the velocity, v, in relation to the trajectory, t, in which g, gravity, of course remains a constant. (Hits a home run) It's not complicated. 

JETER

Now who are you again? 

GEORGE

George Costanza, assistant to the traveling secretary. 

WILLIAMS

Are you the guy who put us in that Ramada in Milwaukee? 

GEORGE

Do you wanna talk about hotels, or do you wanna win some ball games? 

JETER

We won the World Series. 

GEORGE

In six games. 

JERRY

...so if you like to tell jokes, and love to make people laugh, stand-up comedy may be the career for you. 

GEORGE

Nine minutes. 

JERRY

How am I gonna fill two hours? 

GEORGE

Hello? I can take an hour off your hands. Give the kids a chance to see a real live Yankee. 

JERRY

And give you the chance to see some real disappointed kids. (Waitress comes to table) 

WAITRESS

More coffee? 

GEORGE

Excuse me, darling, do I detect a Portuguese accent? 

WAITRESS

Si 

GEORGE

Das kaffes un salat e grand por favor. 

WAITRESS

Mute pragalas senor 

GEORGE

Eh, don't mention it. 

ELAINE

Portuguese? 

GEORGE

Yeah, my cleaning lady's Portuguese. I must've picked it up. 

ELAINE

How come he's gettin' so smart? I stopped having sex with Ben three days ago and I don't know no Portuguese? 

JERRY

Are you all right? 

ELAINE

I don't know. It's just the last coupla days my mind has been, not good. 

JERRY

Wait a second, I know what's happening. The no sex thing is having a reverse effect on you. 

ELAINE

What? What are you talking about? 

JERRY

To a woman, sex is like the garbage man. You just take for granted the fact that any time you put some trash out on the street, a guy in a jumpsuit's gonna come along and pick it up. But now, it's like a garbage strike. The bags are piling up in your head. The sidewalk is blocked. Nothing's getting through. You're stupid. 

ELAINE

I don't understand. 

JERRY

Exactly. 

KRAMER

Hey buddy. 

JERRY

Hey. 

KRAMER

Hey, you should come over. Tonight's pipe night. 

JERRY

What? What happened to your face? It looks like an old catcher's mitt. 

KRAMER

What? (Kramer checks it out.) My face is all craggly, it's crinkly. 

JERRY

It's from all that smoke. You've experienced a lifetime of smoking in 72 hours. What did you expect? 

KRAMER

Emphysema, birth defects, cancer. But not this. Jerry, my face is my livelihood. Everything I have I owe to this face. 

JERRY

And your teeth, your teeth are all brown. 

KRAMER

Look away, I'm hideous. 

ELAINE

Hey, Ben. I need a four letter word. Winnie the blank. 

BEN

Pooh! 

ELAINE

Pooh...(laughing) 

BEN

No, it's Winnie the Pooh. 

LOUISE

So the hospital called, turns out some stupid intern screwed up my test. I never had mono. So we can... you know. 

JERRY

So what did you do? 

GEORGE

I told her I would have to think about it. 

JERRY

But ultimately, you're gonna choose in favor of sex, right? 

GEORGE

I don't know. Perhaps I can better serve the world this way. 

JERRY

You mean, not subjecting yourself to your sexual advances. 

GEORGE

Simple joke from a simple man. 

JERRY

So you're never gonna have sex again? 

GEORGE

Well, Jerry. There was a pretty good chance I was never gonna have sex again anyway. 

JERRY

So you ready for the assembly tomorrow? You know what you're gonna say about the Yankees? 

GEORGE

Oh, sports are so pedestrian. I've prepared some science experiments that will illuminate the mind and dazzle the eye. 

JERRY

I wrote a 20 minute bit about how homework stinks. 

JACKIE

My vacation was restful, splendid, magnificent. In fact, next time I'm plannin' on going to Kofu. 

JACKIE

Oh no. 

KRAMER

Jackie we gotta talk. 

JACKIE

No way, Kramer. You've brought nothing but a mountain of misfortune and humiliation. Now get out. 

KRAMER

But Jackie-- 

JACKIE

I said out. 

KRAMER

Jackie, I think I gotta case against the tobacco companies. 

JACKIE

The who? 

KRAMER

The tobacco companies. 

JACKIE

I've been wanting a piece of them for years. 

JACKIE

Did that cigarette warning label mention anything about damage to your appearance? 

KRAMER

No, it didn't say anything. 

JACKIE

So you're a victim. Now your face is shallow, unattractive, disgusting. 

KRAMER

So Jackie, do you think we gotta case? 

JACKIE

Your face is my case. 

JERRY

How ya doin'? 

ELAINE

Not good. I'm a moron. 

JERRY

Well, don't worry about it. Once he passes the test, you'll have sex again, and you'll be fine. 

ELAINE

Well, that kinda brings us to why I'm here. You got eleven minutes? 

JERRY

What for? Oh come on. 

ELAINE

I just wanna clear my head. It has nothing to do with you. 

JERRY

I think it has something to do with me. 

ELAINE

You could read the paper through the whole thing if you want. 

JERRY

(thinks about it for a second as to reconsider) No, no, no. I'm sorry, it's too weird. 

ELAINE

Oh, all right. Is Kramer home? 

GEORGE

You know, Louise. I think you'll find this amusing. In early Euclidean geometry-- 

LOUISE

George, I have to have sex. 

GEORGE

I used to share that same outlook. But now, I have so many things to occupy my mind. For instance, the atom. 

LOUISE

Goodbye, George. I hate you. (She leaves) 

GEORGE

What a fascinating turn of events. (Waitress approaches) 

WAITRESS

Mas Caf&eacute;? 

GEORGE

Si, por favor. 

JACKIE

Miss Wilkie, your tobacco company has turned this beautiful specimen, into a horrible twisted freak. 

KRAMER

Who could love me? 

WILKIE

I disagree. In fact, I feel Mr. Kramer projects a rugged masculinity. 

JACKIE

Rugged? The man's a goblin. He's only been exposed to smoke for four days. By the time this case gets to trial, he'll be nothing more than a shrunken head. 

WILKIE

All right, Mr. Chiles. You'll have our offer by tomorrow. Good day, gentlemen. (She exits) 

KRAMER

Bye-bye. Jackie, you did it. We're rich. 

JACKIE

You better believe it. Jackie's cashin' in on your wretched disfigurement. 

ELAINE

Congratulations! You passed! 

BEN

Elaine, Elaine. I don't think we should see each other anymore. 

ELAINE

What? you're breaking up with me? But I sacrificed and supported you while you struggled. What about my dream of dating a doctor? 

BEN

I'm sorry, Elaine. I always knew that after I became a doctor, I would dump whoever I was with and find someone better. That's the dream of becoming a doctor. 

ELAINE

Look it, are we going to have sex, or not? 

KATIE

Okay, Jerry, now when the glee club's finished singing, George goes on, then you. (George enters) 

GEORGE

Hey. 

JERRY

Where have you been? You know, you're on next. 

GEORGE

I got lost on the way over. 

JERRY

Got lost? We went to school here for three years. 

GEORGE

What are these? (Holds test tubes to his head like antennae) Take me to your leader. 

JERRY

Oh my God. You had sex. You had sex with Louise! 

GEORGE

No, the Portuguese waitress. 

JERRY

The Portuguese waitress? 

GEORGE

I calculated my odds of ever getting together with a Portuguese waitress. Mathematically, I had to do it, Jerry. 

KATIE

George, George, you're on. 

GEORGE

No, no. I'm not going on. 

JERRY

Then what'd you come down here for? 

GEORGE

Tell you about the Portuguese waitress. 

JERRY

It's good to have you back. 

KATIE

One of you has to go on. 

JERRY

All right, I'll do it. (Goes on stage) Hey kids. What's the deal with homework? you're not working on your home! (Audience boos) 

KRAMER

It was a great lunch, Jackie. Thanks. 

JACKIE

It's a little puzzling we haven't gotten that offer yet. 

KRAMER

Mrs. Wilkie, from the tobacco company called me. We had a little pow-wow. 

JACKIE

A pow-wow? Who told you to have a pow-wow? I didn't tell you to have pow-wow. 

KRAMER

She made an offer. I took it. 

JACKIE

How much? 

KRAMER

No, no, no. There was no money. 

JACKIE

No money? Then what'd we get? 

KRAMER

Check it out. (They see a Marlboro man billboard with Kramer on it) 

JACKIE

This is the most public yet of my many humiliations. 

JERRY

Cancelled? But I was supposed to be on tomorrow night. 

LETTERMAN

Yeah, but then, you know, some people were telling me about that little flap out there at the junior high assembly. And before that, you were bumped by a lizard? 

JERRY

Actually, it was a ********. 

LETTERMAN

those things, deadly dangerous. A long time ago my uncle and a date are driving, like, through Mexico. They see one on the road, drags him out of the road, and chews his face off. Listen, we'll call you if anything opens up. Okay, Jimmy? 

JERRY

Jerry. 

LETTERMAN

Right. Jerry. 

GEORGE

Jerry! (Slams the door) Georgie's moving out! 

JERRY

(Gets up) Get out! 

GEORGE

I'm out! Fantastic apartment right across from mine, huh. I can't wait for you to see it. 

JERRY

(Looks around his apartment) Is it better than mine? 

GEORGE

(Definite) Oh yeah. 

JERRY

So, it's a two-bedroom-one-bath-make-your-friends-hate-ya? 

GEORGE

You know what? it's better than Elaine's, too. I gotta give her a call. (Moves tward the phone) 

JERRY

She's out. 

GEORGE

(Stops) Oh right, the blind date. 

JERRY

Yeah, well, they like to call it a set-up now. I guess the blind people don't like being associated with all those losers. 

GEORGE

Come on. Come check out my new place. It'll take you two minutes. 

JERRY

I can't. I'm meeting Kramer down at my mini-storage. 

GEORGE

(Gloating) Hey, you got any extra furniture down there? I need some more stuff to fill that extra bedroom with the walk-in closet. (Smiles) 

JERRY

(Grabs his coat) Oh, this is really annoying. 

GEORGE

(Laughs as they leave) It's working already! (Both exit) 

JERRY

(Disgusted) What is with that?! 

KRAMER

Well, it's coughing, Jerry. It expells the diseased germs out of the body, into the air. (Makes a guesture of germs being in the air) 

JERRY

(Takes out his key to unlock the unit door) Where is your key? 

KRAMER

Yeah, well, uh, Newman. He's - he's got it. 

JERRY

You know, Kramer, I rented out half of my space to you. 

KRAMER

Yeah, and I rented out half that space to Newman. (Starts coughing again) 

JERRY

(Picks one up) Mail bags? He's storing mail in here? 

KRAMER

(Looks at the bags on the floor) Evidently. 

RICARDI

Excuse me, George? (H1) 

GEORGE

(Looks at her) Yeah, uh, no menus. (Waves her off) 

RICARDI

(Moves into the apartment, hand out) No, I'm Mrs. Ricardi - president of the tenant's association. 

GEORGE

Oh, right! (Shakes her hand) Right! Hey, hey.. I love the floors in here. It's like a gymnasium in here! Try and guard me! (Dribbles an imaginary ball 

RICARDI

No, no.. (Laughs nervously) Uh, George, unfortunately, Clarance Eldridge in 8C has decided that he wants the apartment. 

GEORGE

(Let down) Yeah, but you - you promised it to me. 

RICARDI

Yes, but, you see - Mister Eldridge is an Andrea Doria survivor. And, in light of the terrible suffering that he's already been through, we've decided to give it to him. 

GEORGE

(Depressed) Well,.. the Andrea Doria.. that was quite a fire. (Moves to the door, leaving) 

RICARDI

(Correcting) Shipwreck. 

GEORGE

I remember.. (Leaves) 

ELAINE

Where is this guy?! (Checks her watch) I hate this! (Sighs) I shoulda brought something to read.. (Picks up a sugar packet) 'Cancer in labratory animals'.. huh. 

WAITER

Excuse me, Elaine Benes? 

ELAINE

Yeah? 

WAITER

An Alan Mercer called for you. He said he's sorry, but he won't be able to make it tonight. (Pause) He's been stabbed. 

ELAINE

(Shocked) Stabbed?! 

WAITER

More bread? 

JERRY

(Talking to Elaine) You ate more bread? 

ELAINE

That is not the point! The guy was stabbed! 

JERRY

Did you find out who stabbed him? 

ELAINE

Yeah, (Nodding) It turns out it was his ex-girlfriend. 

JERRY

(Like a father) Well, you're not going near this hooligan anymore. 

ELAINE

Well, I don't know.. I mean, think about it, Jerry. There must be something exciting about this guy if he can arouse that kind of passion. (Obviously turned on by the stabbing) I mean, to be stab-worthy.. You know, it's.. kind of a compliment. 

JERRY

(Sarcastic) Yeah, too bad he didn't get shot. He could have been the one. 

KRAMER

(Coughs) Hey. How's everybody? (Moves to the kitchen) 

ELAINE

Hey. 

KRAMER

Ehh.. (Picks up a carton of food) No expiration date on this.. (Opens it, then starts coughing directly onto the food) 

JERRY

There is now. Kramer, you should really get that cough checked out by a doctor. 

KRAMER

(Shrugging it off) Nah, no, no, no. No doctors for me. A bunch of lackeys and yes-men all towing the company line.. (Looks at Jerry, then leans in so Elaine can't hear) Plus, the botched my vasectimy. 

JERRY

(In awe. Whispering) The botched it? 

KRAMER

(Complaining) I'm even more potent now! 

GEORGE

Hey. 

JERRY

Hey. How's the new place?! 

GEORGE

Gone. (Moves over to a chair in the living room. Kramer takes the carton of food to the table, and begins eating) The tenant association made me give it to this guy because he was an Andrea Doria survivor.. 

ELAINE

Andrea Doria? Isn't that the one they did the song about? 

JERRY

(Correcting her) Edmund Fitzgerald. 

ELANE

I love Edmund Fitzgerald's voice. 

JERRY

(Gives Elaine a look) No, Gordon Lightfoot was the singer. Edmund Fitzgerald was the ship. 

GEORGE

(Talking about his would-be apartment) You could fit 15 people in that bathroom.. 

ELAINE

I think Gordon Lightfoot was the boat. 

JERRY

(Sarcastic) Yeah, and it was rammed by the Cat Stevens. 

KRAMER

(Like a teacher) The Andrea Doria collided with the Stockholm in dense fog 21 miles off the coast of Nantucket. (Makes a clicking sound with his tongue) 

GEORGE

How do you know? 

KRAMER

it's in my book - 'Astonishing Tales of the Sea' 51 people died. 

GEORGE

51 people?! That's it?! I thought it was, like, a thousand! 

KRAMER

There were 1,650 survivors. 

GEORGE

That's no tragedy! How many people do you lose on a normal cruse? 30? 40?! Kramer, can I take a look at that book? (Starts walking tward the door. Kramer grabs his food, and follows) 

KRAMER

Oh yeah. I also got 'Astounding Bear Attacks' 

JERRY

Hey, uh, before you go, did you talk to Newman about getting that mail outta there? 

KRAMER

Yeah, oh, yeah. Yeah, he's not gonna do it. (Leaves) 

JERRY

Newman? 

NEWMAN

(Eyes glued to the TV) I guess. 

JERRY

Listen, I want you to get the mail outta my storage unit. 

NEWMAN

Sometimes we don't get what we want. 

JERRY

(Confused) What are you talking about? 

NEWMAN

I didn't get my transfer. 

JERRY

'Transfer'? 

NEWMAN

To Hawaii. The most sought-after postal route of them all. The air is so dewy-sweet you don't even have to like the stamps.. But it's not to be - So, I'm hanging it up. 

JERRY

You quit the post office? 

NEWMAN

Kind of. I'm still collecting checks, I'm just not delivering mail. 

JERRY

Well, get it out of my storage. It's illegal. 

NEWMAN

And yet, it's perfectly legal to take a man's soul and crush it out like a stale Pall Mall. 

JERRY

(Cheerfully) Well, a law's a law. (Leaves) 

KRAMER

Ok, hold on there.. That's a nasty cough you got there, huh? 

MAN

What cough? 

ELAINE

I love shrimp! (Waves her knife around as she's talking) I'm a shrimp eater. You put shrimp infront of me, (Waves her knife along with her hand gestures. Alan is getting edgy about it, and even more so with every wave) and I will eat it until my stomach pops! (Notices Alan's unsettled) Oh.. (Puts the knife down) 

ALAN

No, it's okay. I'm.. still just a little bit jumpy. 

ELAINE

(Leans in close) Between you and me, what happened there with the stabbing? 

ALAN

Just.. one of those things, you know. 

ELAINE

What? Was she just so crazy in love with you that she just couldn't take it anymore? Or..? 

ALAN

I don't know. Could be. 

CAROL

Alan?! 

ALAN

Carol? 

ELAINE

(Gets up, pointing after Carol) Was that the one?! Was that the one who stabbed you?! 

ALAN

(Between screams) No, that was a different girl. 

JERRY

There was another crazed ex-girlfriend? 

ELAINE

Right, so, I called my friend, you know - the one who set us up - I found out, he's a bad-breaker-upper. 

JERRY

Mmm.. Bad how? 

ELAINE

(Fast) Well, you know when you break up, how you say things you don't mean? Well, he says the mean things you don't mean, but he means them. 

JERRY

(Nods) I follow. So what are you gonna do? 

ELAINE

Dump him. I can't be with someone who doesn't break up nicely. I mean, to me, that's one of the most important parts of a relationship. 

JERRY

(Agreeing) What's more important? 

KRAMER

(Between coughs) Hey. 

GEORGE

What's with the dog? 

KRAMER

(Petting Smuckers) Yeah, this is Smuckers. I borrowed him. (Starts coughing) 

GEORGE

Oh.. 

KRAMER

(Pointing at the dog) Yeah, we share the same affliction, so I'm gonna have a vet check us out. 

GEORGE

A vet? 

KRAMER

Oh, I'll take a vet over an M.D. any day. They gotta be able to cure a (Snaps his fingers in rhythm with his words) lizard, a chicken, a pig, a frog (Stops snapping) - all on the same day. 

GEORGE

So, if I may jump ahead - you're gonna take dog medicine? 

KRAMER

(Smiling) You bet we are! Huh, Smuckers? (Smuckers coughs. They turn to leave) I'll see ya. 

GEORGE

Ahoy! Mr. Eldridge. I understand you were on the Andrea Doria. 

ELDRIDGE

Yes, it was a terrifying ordeal. 

GEORGE

I tell ya, I hear people really stuff themselves on those cruise ships. (Laughs) The buffet, that's the real ordeal, huh, Clarence? (Laughs) 

ELDRIDGE

(Defensively) We had to abandon ship. 

GEORGE

Well, all vacations have to end eventually. 

ELDRIDGE

The boat sank. 

GEORGE

(Holding up Kramer's book) According to this, it took.. 10 hours. It eased into the water like an old man into a nice warm bath - no offence. (Pause) So, uh, Clarence, how about abandoning this apartment, and letting me shove off in this beauty? 

ELDRIDGE

Is that what this is all about?! I don't think I like you. (Enters his apartment, and slams the door behind him) 

GEORGE

(Yelling out) It's my apartment, Eldridge! The Stalkholm may not have sunk ya, but I will! Ha, ha, ha! 

VET

What are the symptoms? 

KRAMER

Well, uh.. it hurts when he swallows. Expecially when he drinks orange juice. (Vet gives him a look) I mean, uh.. dog food.. juice. (Adding) What's worse - he has a nagging cough. (Smucker's coughs) Yeah, that's it. That's it. 

VET

Yeah, well, uh - we've been seeing a lot of this lately. Been drinking from the toilet? 

KRAMER

(Offended) What? No. That's disgusting.. 

ALAN

So that's it? We're, uh, we're breakin' up? 

ELAINE

(Confused by his sudden change-of-heart) What? Break-up? We went out on one date. 

ALAN

(Fast) Ok, yeah, sure, fine, right. Whatever you say. 

ELAINE

(Shows no sign that she cares) Alright, good. Good. 

ALAN

Ok, then, well, So.. see ya around.. big head. (Gets up to leave) 

ELAINE

Pardon? 

ALAN

You got a big head. It's too big for your body. (Walks for the door) 

ELAINE

(Laughing out loud) That's it?! (Laughs again) That's the best you got?! (Laughs loudly as Alan exits) 

GEORGE

So, he's keeping the apartment. He doesn't deserve it, though! Even if he did suffer, that was, like, 40 years ago! What has he been doing lately?! I've been suffering for the past 30 years up to and including yesterday! 

JERRY

You know, if this tenant board is so impressed with suffering, maybe you should tell them the 'Astonishing Tales of Costanza'. 

GEORGE

(Interested) I should! 

JERRY

I mean, your body of work in this field is unparalleled. 

GEORGE

I could go bumper to bumper with any one else on this planet! 

JERRY

You're the man! 

NEWMAN

Jerry! 

JERRY

I'm with people, I'll be with you in a moment. (Slams the door on Newman's face. Then tries to delay talking to Newman by keeping the conversation with George going) So, you want a protein shake, or something? 

GEORGE

Nah, I guess I should really get moving on this, huh? I'm gonna go. (Opens the door, letting Newman in. Leaves) 

JERRY

(Angered) Hello.. Newman. 

NEWMAN

(Urgent) I need that mail, where is it?! 

JERRY

What's the difference? 

NEWMAN

The guy who had the Hawaii transfer got busted for hoarding Victoria Secret catalogues. I gotta deliver that mail! 

JERRY

Well, go ahead. There's 8 bags of it. 

NEWMAN

Blast! There's no way I can handle 8 in addition to my ususal load of one! I'll never get to Hawaii! (Moves over to Jerry's couch, depressed) I'll be stuck in this apartment building forever! (Lays down on Jerry's couch) The dream is dead. 

JERRY

You're giving up that easy? 

NEWMAN

I usually do. (Gets up to leave) See ya. 

JERRY

(Stopping him) No, wait a minute, Newman! You can't let this dream die. You moving away is my dream too! 

NEWMAN

(Intrigued) What are you proposing? 

JERRY

(Fast) Whatever it takes, for as long as it takes me, where ever it takes me as long as it takes you away from me! 

NEWMAN

An alliance? 

JERRY

(Confirming) An alliance. (They both shake hands and laugh evily) Now get the hell outta here. (Newman leaves) 

ELAINE

Hawaii? That's why you're helping Newman with the mail? 

JERRY

(Like an Army general) Elaine, Newman is my sworn enemy. And he lives down the hall from my home - my home, Elaine! Where I sleep, where I come to play with my toys. 

ELAINE

Well, anyway, get this: I spoke to Alan. You know, I told him I didn't want to see him anymore.. He called me 'big head'. 

JERRY

'Big head' (Scoffs) That's almost a compliment. 

ELAINE

(Agreeing) It's one of the nicest things anyone's ever said to me. 

JERRY

Hello? 

GEORGE

(On the other line) Hey. 

JERRY

Hey, George. 

GEORGE

Yeah, listen, I can't make it later. 

JERRY

You can't make it? 

GEORGE

Yeah, the tenant association has decided to hear my side of the story. So, uh, I gotta kinda get ready. I'll see ya. 

JERRY

Alright. (Hangs up) 

ELAINE

Is he not gonna go to the coffee shop? 

JERRY

(Saddened) Doesn't look like it's gonna happen. 

ELAINE

(Gives a 'That's a shame' face) Alright, well, I'll see ya. (Opens the door to exit. Kramer enters coughing. Elaine does her best to dodge out of the way of Kramer's coughs, then walks off) 

JERRY

Kramer, aren't you taking any medication for that? 

KRAMER

Yeah, yeah. (Pulls a bottle out of his pocket) I got some pilss. They taste terrible. 

JERRY

(Takes the bottle from him) Just swallow 'em. 

KRAMER

(Gestures to his throat) No, my throat's too tender. 

JERRY

Alright, sit down, sit down. (Grabs a pill from the bottle, and starts advancing tward Kramer - like an owner with his dog) 

KRAMER

I don't want to! 

JERRY

C'mon. Just sit down! 

KRAMER

(Squirming) Jerry! What?! 

JERRY

Sit down! Sit down! 

KRAMER

(Struggling) Hey! 

JERRY

Lean your head back. Open your mouth! (Grabs Kramer's head) Open your mouth! Open it! Open it! 

JERRY

(Reads the pill bottle) What kind of pills are these, anyways?! 'For Smuckers'? 'May cause panting and loss of fur'? (Turns to Kramer) These are dog pills! 

KRAMER

Whe have the same symptoms. 

JERRY

But, he's a dog! You need to see a real doctor. 

KRAMER

No, no. No doctors. 

JERRY

Alright.. (Heads for the door, grabbing his coat) 

KRAMER

Where are you going? 

JERRY

I'm taking the car. I gotta run some errands. You want to go? 

KRAMER

I don't know.. 

JERRY

(Opens the door) C'mon, you wanna go for a ride? (Starts jiggling his keys - as if he's calling out for a dog) Huh? C'mon! C'mon! 

DRIVER

Lady, could you move your head a little bit? 

ELAINE

What? 

DRIVER

Your head. I can't see out the back. (Elaine slumps down in her seat) Little more.. (Elaine slumps lower) ..Little more. (Slides down until just her eyes and forehead can be seen) Thank you. 

KRAMER

I don't see any tissues back her.. (Looks out the windows) Wait a minute!.. (Jerry looks like he's trying to keep something from Kramer) This isn't the way to the park! (Starts getting even more energetic) Where are we going?.. I recognize this block! (Looks at Jerry, scared) You're taking me to the doctor! 

GEORGE

So, uh, Mom, Dad, I was hoping that you could help me to remember my childhood a little clearly.. 

ESTELLE

I feel a draft. (Grabs the bread basket and her drink) Let's change tables. 

FRANK

Get outta here! We have a booth. 

ESTELLE

Frank, I'm cold! 

FRANK

Order a hot dish. 

ESTELLE

Why can't we sit over there? (Points to a table) 

FRANK

(Yelling) That's not a booth! 

ESTELLE

(Trying to match Frank's loudness) So, who says we have to sit in a booth?! 

FRANK

(Loud shouting) I didn't take the subway all the way to New York to sit at a table like that! (Gestures to the table) 

ESTELLE

(Nagging yell) Well, I didn't take the subway to be in a drafty restaurant! 

GEORGE

(Pleading for them to stop) Mom.. dad. 

FRANK

Now, George, what do you want to know about your childhood? 

GEORGE

(Fed up with his parents) Actually, I think I'm pretty clear on it. 

FRANK

(Looks up) Where's that breeze coming from? 

JERRY

Kramer, outta the car. Out, now! 

KRAMER

No, Jerry! 

JERRY

Alright, that's it.. (Grabs Kramer, trying to pull him out of the car) 

KRAMER

No! Don't! 

JERRY

Hey, hey! Get back over here! Kramer! Get over here! You are bad! Bad neighbor! Kramer! 

ELDRIDGE

Just then, a rescue ship emerged from the fog and saved us. It was.. (Stops, then gives George a look. George stops knocking on the walls) It was the sweetest sight my eyes ever saw. 

RICARDI

(Touched) Thank you Mr. Eldridge. The tenant board will now hear Mr. Costanza's testimony. 

JERRY

Newman, how'd it go? Did you get it all delivered? (Sees the pac) What happened? 

NEWMAN

Kramer bit me! 

JERRY

Bit you?! 

NEWMAN

We had an arguement about me going to Hawaii, and he locked onto my ankle like it was a soup bone. I'm hubbled! I don't think I can do my route - and they're awarding the transfer in two days! 

JERRY

(Bravely) Well, what if I deliver it? 

NEWMAN

You?! (Laughs hysterically) You can't deliver mail! 

JERRY

Well, why not? 

NEWMAN

(Thinks for a moment) I guess you're right. It's just walking around putting it into boxes.. 

JERRY

What am I gonna wear? 

NEWMAN

I could give you my uniform from my rookie year. 

JERRY

(Excited) I can't believe I'm gonna be a mailman! 

JERRY

(Hands him some mail) There you go. Merry Chirstmas! 

OWNER

Mail on Sunday? 

JERRY

(Shrugs) Oops. (Continues walking along the route, whistling. Hands a newspaper to a homeless bum on the street, then keeps walking) 

GEORGE

I was handcuffed to the bed.. In my underwear, (Sighs) where I remained.. (Scene cuts to another story) She was attractive.. She was, also, infact, a Nazi.. (Cuts to another story) The water.. that I had been swiming in was.. very cold. And, when I dropped the towel, there was.. significant shrinkage.. (Scene cuts to, yet, another story) Her parents were looking at me.. So, there I was, with a marble rye hanging from the end of a fishing pole.. (Scene cuts to his closing statements) In closing, these stories have not been embellished, because - they need no embellishment. They are simply, horrifyingly, the story of my life as a short, stocky, slow witted bald man. (Gets up) Thank you. (Every memeber of the board shows some sign that George's story is most deserving of the apartment. Ricardi is crying. George turns to leave, then remembers one more thing..) Oh, also.. my fiance died from licking toxic envelopes that I picked out. (Sobs and loud crying erupts from the board members) Thanks again. (Leaves. Eldridge looks defeated) 

JERRY

Hey, I've been trying to jam stuff in the box, like you told me, but sometimes it says, like, 'Photographs - Do not bend'. 

NEWMAN

'Do not bend'. (Laughs evilly) Just crease, crumple, cram.. you'll do fine. (Phone rings. Newman answers it) Hello?.. This is he. I don't understand.. very well. (Hangs up in disappointment) 

JERRY

What? 

NEWMAN

That was the Vice President of the post office. I didn't get the transfer.. They knew it wasn't me doing my route! 

JERRY

How did they know?! 

NEWMAN

(Stands up) Too many people go their mail! Close to 80%. No body from the post office has ever cracked the 50% barrier! It's like the 3-minute mile! 

JERRY

(Pleading) I tried my best! 

NEWMAN

Exactly. You're a disgrace to the uniform. (Newman takes off Jerry's mailman hat. Jerry turns his head in shame. Newman then tears the post office badge from Jerry's coat) 

JERRY

You know, this is your coat. 

NEWMAN

(Realizing) Damn! 

ELAINE

(Rubbing her head to relieve the pain) Really? 

GEORGE

It's not contest. The guy had nothing! The ship went down, he got into a life boat, I mean, come on. 

JERRY

Boy, he didn't know what he was up against. (George laughs) So, when do you move into the apartment? 

GEORGE

They're making their decision today. 

JERRY

What's the matter with you? 

ELAINE

Nothing.. Except that a bird ran into my giant freak-head. (Sits down) 

JERRY

What giant freak-head? 

ELAINE

(Annoyed, near tears) The one that sits atop my disproportunately puny body.. I'm a walking candy apple! 

JERRY

So, it's actually gotten to you? You're playing right into his hands! 

ELAINE

(Realizing) What? Yeah.. you're right!.. All I have to do is call him up, and sit with him, and show him that it doesn't bother me. You know, laugh it off.. or jam a fork into his forehead. 

JERRY

(Casually, sarcastic) Either way. 

ELAINE

(Getting up to leave) Alright. 

ALAN

I want to apologize for.. 

ELAINE

(Shrugging it off) Oh, please. 

ALAN

So you have a big head. 

ELAINE

(Casually playing along) So what? 

ALAN

It goes well with that bump in your nose. 

ELAINE

(Suddenly angry) What?! 

WOMAN

Please! Get help! There's a crazy big-headed woman beating up some guy! Tell the police 'The Old Mill Restaurant'. Hurry! 

COP

Boy, that's some cough you got there. 

GEORGE

Excuse me, uh, what are you doing in there? 

ALAN

I'm moving in. Alan Mercer. New neighbor. (They shake hands) 

GEORGE

What? Elaine's big-head guy? They have you the apartment?! 

ALAN

Yeah. 

GEORGE

Why?! Because you were stabbed, and.. got coffee thrown in your face, and.. uh.. (Points to Alan's bandaged forehead) 

ALAN

Oh, fork in the forehead. 

GEORGE

That's why they gave you the apartment? 

ALAN

No, I just gave the super 50 bucks. 

GEORGE

Wait a minute, that is my apartment. I earned it with 34 years of misery! 

ALAN

Tough luck, chinless. (Goes into his new apartment, and slams the door on George) 

JERRY

So what happened to you yesterday? We were supposed to go to the auto show, I waited for you, you never came. 

ELAINE

I'm sorry, I got really busy. How long did you wait? 

JERRY

Five minutes. 

ELAINE

Five minutes? That's it? 

JERRY

What's the difference? You never showed up. 

ELAINE

I could've! I mean, last week we waited for that friend of Kramer's for like, forty minutes. 

JERRY

Well, we barely knew the guy. 

ELAINE

So, the longer you know someone, the shorter you wait for 'em. 

JERRY

That's the way it works. 

ELAINE

When did you tell George to be here? 

JERRY

I told him to meet us here in ten minutes. How long has it been? 

ELAINE

About five. 

JERRY

That's enough. (They leave. George comes around the corner.) 

GEORGE

Early! Alright! (shivers.) Cold. 

KRAMER

So, I noticed you bounced a check at the bodega. 

JERRY

How did you know about that? 

KRAMER

Because Marcelino, he taped it up on his cash register with all the other bad checks. 

JERRY

He can't do that. 

KRAMER

It's the only way you'll learn. (Tastes his eggs.) Aw, these eggs are disgusting. This chicken should be ashamed of himself. 

GEORGE

Fantastic day! Fantastic! 

JERRY

What happened? 

GEORGE

(laughs - hehe) Well, first, I'm brushing my teeth and this piece of apple-skin, that must have been lodged in there for days, comes loose. 

JERRY

Fantastic. 

GEORGE

Then, I'm at The Foundation... 

JERRY

You're still doing that? 

GEORGE

Sometimes, once in a while. 

JERRY

When you feel guilty. 

GEORGE

No, occasionally I'll forget to let the machine pick up. Anyway, they made this large donation, to a women's prison, and I get to go down there and check it out. 

KRAMER

That's caged heat. 

GEORGE

Yeah-hah! 

JERRY

What are you gonna do there? 

GEORGE

Nothing really, you know...just eh, stroll around the cell blocks, maybe eh, take in a shower fight. (chuckles.) Hey eh, you know you got a bounced check hanging up in the little market over on Columbus? 

JERRY

Yes, I know, I know. 

GEORGE

I noticed you eh, chose the eh 'clowns with balloons' check design. 

JERRY

It was a mistake, the bank sent me the wrong ones. 

ELAINE

Hey! Look who's here! Hey Kurt, this is Jerry, and George, and Kramer. 

KRAMER

Hey, Kurt. Taste these eggs. 

KURT

Uh, no - I only eat cage-free, farm-fresh. 

KRAMER

Yes! These are sweatshop eggs. 

KURT

Ah, I gotta call the office. Honey, will you order for me? 

ELAINE

I'm a 'honey.' He's pretty great, huh? 

JERRY

Is he from the future? 

ELAINE

No, he just shaves his head. I think it's pretty gutsy. 

GEORGE

Listen, sweetheart, let me tell you a little something about guts. (Points to his head.) This is guts. 

ELAINE

What? Clinging to some scraps? 

GEORGE

These are not 'scraps.' These are historic remains of a once Great Society of Hair. 

ELAINE

Oh, did you guys stop at the bodega today? Some moron bounced a clown check! 

JERRY

Again, I'm really sorry about the check, Marcelino. 

MARCELINO

People seem to like the clowns. 

JERRY

Look, let me just give you the forty, plus another twenty for your trouble. 

MARCELINO

'Kay. 

JERRY

Aren't you going to take the check down? 

MARCELINO

Sorry, no. It's store policy. 

JERRY

But it's your bodega. 

MARCELINO

Even I am not above the policy. 

BETSY

Those are our tennis courts. 

GEORGE

Tennis courts? W-w-what about the yard? Where do they have the gang fights? 

BETSY

There's no fights here, Mr. Costanza. This is a minimum security facility. 

GEORGE

Hmm. What about a hole? You ever put anybody in 'the box'? 

BETSY

No. 

GEORGE

This prison stinks. 

BETSY

And finally, the library, which has just been refurbished thanks to your generous donation. This is Celia Morgan, our librarian. 

CELIA

Nice to meet you. 

BETSY

I'll be in my office if you need me. 

GEORGE

Thanks, Warden. 

BETSY

Betsy. 

GEORGE

Betsy. 

CELIA

So, are you the head of the foundation? 

GEORGE

Well, let's just say it wouldn't exist without me. (Notices another person in the library dressed the same as Celia.) So you two uh, shop at the same store, (hu)? 

CELIA

No, it's standard issue. 

GEORGE

Oh my God...You're in jail? (Celia nods.) That is so cool! 

JERRY

You asked her out? 

GEORGE

Well...not 'out.' She's a prisoner. 

JERRY

How could you ask her out? 

GEORGE

Why not? 

JERRY

I remember when you wouldn't date that girl who lived in Queens because you didn't want to go over the bridge! 

GEORGE

That was different! 

JERRY

I'll say. 

GEORGE

Jerry, I like being with her. Plus, I know where she is all the time. I have relatively no competition. An-and you know how you live in fear of the pop-in? 

JERRY

The pop-in. 

GEORGE

Yeah, no pop-in, no 'in the neighborhood,' no 'I saw your light was on.' And the best part is, if things go really well... 

JERRY

Conjugal visit? 

GEORGE

Don't jinx it! Don't jinx (trails off quietly in elation) 

KRAMER

Hey. 

GEORGE

Hey. 

KRAMER

What's up? 

JERRY

George is dating a convict. 

KRAMER

Oh? What's she in for? (putting groceries in the fridge) 

GEORGE

Embezzlement. 

KRAMER

Sounds like a nice girl. Hey Jerry, is it all right if I put some stuff in your fridge? 'Cause mine's full. 

JERRY

Yeah, sure. You don't even have a fridge, do you? 

KRAMER

Well, not here. 

KRAMER

Okay (lifting the bag and carrying it into the apt.) 

JERRY

Kramer, Kramer, wait a minute, what the hell is that? 

KRAMER

Well, it's chicken feed. (Slams the bag into Jerry's fridge.) 

JERRY

I sense something is afoot. 

KRAMER

Yeah, I bought a chicken. 

GEORGE

Allow me. Why? 

KRAMER

Cage-free, farm-fresh eggs. 

JERRY

Allow me. What are you, an idiot? 

KRAMER

No (throws hand in the air and turns and looks back at Jerry) 

KURT

Hold it, hold it, hold it, here, I got it. Catch. (Tosses his wallet to Elaine, she pays the delivery guy.) 

ELAINE

Hm. (looking at Kurt's driver's license photo) Hey, driver's license. Oh...my God. 

KURT

What? 

ELAINE

Your hair. It's so thick and lustrous. I mean, it...it was. 

KURT

Well, it still is. I shave my head for my swim team. I just liked the way it looked, so I kept it. 

ELAINE

Are you saying that I could be dating this hair? I mean wi..with you under it? (Kurt shrugs.) 

JERRY

(sits up in bed) Oh what... 

KRAMER

Hey. 

JERRY

Is that your 'chicken' making all that noise? 

KRAMER

Oh, Jerry loves the morning. 

JERRY

Who? 

KRAMER

Little Jerry Seinfeld. I named my chicken after you. 

JERRY

Thanks, that's very sweet, but that is not, a chicken. 

KRAMER

Of course it is. I picked it out myself. 

JERRY

Well, you picked out a rooster. 

KRAMER

Well, that would explain Little Jerry's poor egg production. 

CELIA

This was fun. 

GEORGE

Yeah. I had a great time. 

GUARD

Five minutes, Mr. Costanza. 

GEORGE

The whole hour just flew by. (laughs - hehe) (Begins cleaning up the table.) 

GUARD

I'll get that. 

GEORGE

Oh, thanks, Bobby. (To Celia) Well, I guess I'll see you in four days. 

CELIA

Yeah. Go out and have a ball with the guys. I'll be waiting right here for you. 

GEORGE

Of course you will. (quick chuckle). You're the best. (with a light fist motion across her chin) 

CELIA

Hmm 

JERRY

Hello? 

HELEN

Jerry? Leo told us he saw your bounced check. Are you having money problems? 

JERRY

I'm not having money problems. 

HELEN

Enough with the comedy! You're very clever, you should look into advertising. 

MORTY

He never even called Ed Roydlick. They were looking for someone! 

JERRY

I'm not calling Ed Roydlick. I'm doing fine! 

HELEN

That's it. I'm gonna to send you fifty dollars. 

JERRY

You are NOT sending me fifty dollars! 

HELEN

We're sending you fifty dollars! Morty, get me an envelope. 

JERRY

I swear to God, if you send me fifty dollars, you are gonna be so sorry! 

MORTY

I don't see envelopes! 

HELEN

They're right in front of you! Oh, for heaven's sakes... (She puts the phone down on the couch and goes to help Morty.) Show you... 

JERRY

Ma! Ma! MAAA! (Hangs up the phone in disgust.) Oh, ahhhh (sighs quietly) 

GEORGE

How're the folks? 

JERRY

Good. 

GEORGE

So? Movie tonight? 

JERRY

I thought you were going out with Celia? 

GEORGE

I did. I'm back. I love this relationship, I feel so liberated! 

JERRY

Having her in jail. 

GEORGE

The only thing that bothers me is that I'm just coming up with this now. 

JERRY

Yeah, dating a convicted felon. I don't know how you missed it. 

ELAINE

Here. (Shows Kurt's driver's license to Jerry.) Take a look at that. 

JERRY

Huh. Kurt's an organ donor. 

ELAINE

No! He's not bald. Look! He's got a full head of hair. 

JERRY

So he just shaves his head for no reason? 

GEORGE

That's like using a wheelchair for the fun of it! 

ELAINE

And he's growing it in just for me. (Happily) It's mine. It's all mine. (clutches the photo between her hands and to her chest then looks at it again) 

JERRY

It's just hair. 

ELAINE

It's not just hair! Look! 

JERRY

It's brown. 

ELAINE

It's chestnut with auburn highlights! 

JERRY

So? 

ELAINE

You're not around women. You don't know how important a man's hair is. 

ELAINE

I'm sorry, George, but it's true. 

GEORGE

I knew it. 

MARCELINO

Hey, Kramer. 

KRAMER

Yeah (quietly) 

MARCELINO

Nice rooster. 

KRAMER

Yeah (again quietly) 

MARCELINO

What's his name? 

KRAMER

Ah, well, this is Little Jerry Seinfeld. 

MARCELINO

Little Jerry Seinfeld. Does he bounce checks? (laughs) 

KRAMER

Look, can't you take Jerry's check down? 

MARCELINO

Sorry Kramer, can't help you. 

KRAMER

Hey, hey Jerry, come on. Sorry. 

MARCELINO

I like the way he handles himself. 

KRAMER

Oh yeah (quietly) 

ELAINE

Ohhh, it's coming in already! 

KURT

Yeah (quietly) 

ELAINE

Wow, you have some very nice little seedlings here. Huh... 

KURT

What? 

ELAINE

Well, it doesn't seem to be coming in so good over here. Or here. 

KURT

What do you mean? (Goes into the bedroom to look in the mirror.) 

ELAINE

Well, I don't know... h- how long have you been shaving your head for? 

KURT

About three years. 

ELAINE

Huh. 

KURT

Oh my God! (Steps into the doorway) I'm going bald! 

CELIA

George! I'm so glad to see you! 

GEORGE

Hey, I brought you some cigarettes. You buy yourself something nice. 

CELIA

Good news - I'm up for parole. 

GEORGE

Parole! (Feigning joy) That's dynamite! 

JERRY

So Marcelino's going to take down the check? 

KRAMER

Yeah, Well, it comes down if Little Jerry Seinfeld wins the cockfight. 

JERRY

Great! (realizing) What? 

KRAMER

Well, Marcelino, he has cockfights in the back of his store. 

JERRY

Ah ha... 

KRAMER

Yeah, so he says if Little Jerry Seinfeld wins, the check comes down. 

JERRY

Kramer, cockfighting is illegal. 

KRAMER

Only in The United States. 

JERRY

It's inhumane! 

KRAMER

No, Jerry, it's not what you think it is. 

JERRY

It's two roosters peckin' at each other! 

KRAMER

What? 

JERRY

Yeah! 

KRAMER

Well, I thought they wore gloves and helmets, you know, like 'American Gladiators.' 

JERRY

No Kramer, Little Jerry could get hurt. 

KRAMER

Yeah, well, I left him with Marcelino! 

KRAMER

My Little Jerry! (Runs out.) 

JERRY

Hey, did you get Little Jerry, is he O.K.? 

KRAMER

Oh well, he's more than O.K., he won! 

JERRY

You let him fight? 

KRAMER

Yeah, well I couldn't get there in time to stop it, but you should have seen Little Jerry, Jerry! Flappin' his wings and struttin' his stuff! He was peckin' and weavin' and bobbin' and talkin' trash! He didn't even have to touch him! The other rooster ran out of the ring. The whole fight lasted two seconds. 

JERRY

How long do they usually last? 

KRAMER

Five seconds. And Marcelino says he's taking your check down today. 

JERRY

Great! 

KRAMER

Hey. 

GEORGE

Celia's up for parole. 

KRAMER

Hey, Little Jerry won his cockfight. 

GEORGE

What? 

KRAMER

Who? 

JERRY

I'm too tired. 

KRAMER

O.K., listen, I want you to come by later, alright? 'Cause we're having a victory party for Little Jerry. 

JERRY

O.K. (Kramer leaves.) 

GEORGE

It's over, Jerry. She's gettin' out. 

JERRY

Ah, I'm so sorry. 

GEORGE

She's been locked up for two years. She's gonna want to make up for lost time. Dinners. Movies. (Rubs his forehead.) Talking... 

JERRY

In other words, a normal relationship. 

GEORGE

Heh, haa. And that's no good. I've tried it straight, Jerry. We've all seen the results. For me, sick is the only way to go. 

JERRY

Well, she'll still be an ex-con. 

GEORGE

It's not the same. 

JERRY

Hey, if you two are meant to be together...I'm sure the cops'll pick her up on something. 

ELAINE

Kurt? What's with the sweats? Aren't we going out? 

KURT

I don't care. 

ELAINE

You, uh...got a big stain on your shirt. 

KURT

Oh yeah...meatball...fell out of my sandwich. 

ELAINE

You already ate? 

KURT

It's from yesterday. 

MARCELINO

Jerry! You missed a hell of a cockfight last night. 

JERRY

Then what is my check still doing up? We had a deal! 

MARCELINO

Now we have a new deal. 

JERRY

New deal? 

MARCELINO

When Little Jerry Seinfeld is mine, the check will be yours. 

JERRY

This is Outrageous! (To Marcelino) Pack of Juicy Fruit. 

MARCELINO

85 cents. 

JERRY

85 cents? That is Outrageous! 

JERRY

Kramer, Marcelino wants us to sell him Little Jerry Seinfeld. 

KRAMER

Well, that's out of the question. 

JERRY

But Kramer, cockfighting is an illegal and immoral activity. 

KRAMER

Yeah, if you got a loser. But Little Jerry was born to cockfight! 

JERRY

No, no more cockfighting. Let's just sell him to Marcelino the cockfighter and be done with it! 

KRAMER

You know, I think you're jealous. 

JERRY

Of what? 

KRAMER

Yah, yah! You see in Little Jerry Seinfeld the unlimited future you once had. Now, just because Jerry Seinfeld is a has-been, don't make Little Jerry Seinfeld a never-was! 

JERRY

Kramer, give me that rooster! 

KRAMER

Never! You hate him because he's doing more with your name than you ever will! Yah-yah! (Kramer leaves.) 

BETSY

George, Celia has listed you as a character reference. Whatever you can tell us would certainly be helpful in, her getting paroled. 

GEORGE

Well, anything I can do to help, um...she's a wonderful girl. Very smart. Very eh...crafty. 

BETSY

Does she have any plans after she's released? 

GEORGE

Plans. Schemes. She ah, she keeps talking about getting back together with her old friends, you know - 'the gang,' as she likes to call them (chuckles), you know. Yeah, they're eh, they're hatching something, you can count on that. 

MARCELINO

Jerry! Tomorrow night's fight-night. Where's my rooster? 

JERRY

Kramer won't sell. 

MARCELINO

Well, tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna take down your check anyway. 

JERRY

Oh well, thank you, Marcelino. 

MARCELINO

Well, perhaps someday you will do me a favor. And that day is today. Little Jerry Seinfeld must go down in the third round of tomorrow's main event. 

JERRY

You want Little Jerry to take a dive? 

MARCELINO

Shhh, not so loud. 

JERRY

First of all, I don't think you can make a rooster take a dive. 

MARCELINO

Can, too! 

JERRY

Second of all, Jerry Seinfeld - big or little - doesn't go down for anyone, anywhere, at anytime! Now I'd appreciate it if you please leave. 

MARCELINO

Big Jerry is making a big mistake, Jerry. 

JERRY

We'll see about that. (Runs to the window and shouts up to Kramer, who's on the roof.) Kramer, I'm comin' up! We got a cockfight to win! 

KRAMER

O.K.! 

KURT

Elaine said you would be the best person I could talk to. 

GEORGE

Yep. Classic horseshoe pattern. I've seen a lot of this. 

KURT

Oh, God. 

GEORGE

No, no, Kurt - wrong attitude. You should be happy now. 

KURT

Happy? Why should I be happy? 

GEORGE

You've still got pretty good coverage. Once the enemy advances beyond this perimeter - (points at Kurt's head with a pen) - then you won't be Kurt anymore. 

KURT

Who will I be? 

KURT

How long do I have? 

GEORGE

14 months. Maybe 10. 

KURT

Is there anything I can do? 

GEORGE

Yes. Live, dammit. Live! Every precious moment as if this was the last year of your life. Because in many ways...it is. (There's a knock at the door.) Excuse me. 

GEORGE

Celia? W-w-what are you doing here? 

CELIA

Well, I didn't get my parole, so I busted out. 

GEORGE

And-and you just decided to pop in...! 

ELAINE

Kurt! 

KURT

Elaine...(holds out a wedding ring) Will you marry me? 

KRAMER

Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Boy he's lookin' good, huh Jerry? 

JERRY

Yeah. Alright, I think that's enough for today. (Kramer picks up Little Jerry and takes him to the sink.) Little Jerry is lean, mean, peckin' machine! (Kramer starts filling a pot with water.) What are you doing with that? 

KRAMER

I'm just gonna heat this up. Make a little hot-tub for Little Jerry. 

JERRY

Hey, Kramer...? 

JERRY

Be careful. 

GEORGE

Hey. 

JERRY

Hey, guess what! Little Jerry ran from here to Newman's in under thirty seconds! 

GEORGE

Is that good? 

JERRY

I don't know. Where have you been? 

GEORGE

Celia broke out of prison. I'm sitting in my home, she shows up at the door! 

JERRY

Oh my God! 'The break-out/pop-in!' 

GEORGE

Yeah. Hey Jerry, listen to this. I discovered something even better than conjugal visit sex. Fugitive sex! Now, it's like everytime - 

JERRY

George, this is a little too much for me - escaped convicts, fugitive sex...I got a cockfight to focus on. (Jerry leaves.) 

ELAINE

Hey hey Kurt, slow down! I can't just marry you, whim-bam-boom! I mean, I need some 'fiance-time,' I need some 'make-my-girlfriends-jealous' time... 

KURT

Plus, you want to get to know me. 

ELAINE

Yeah, yeah, that too. 

KURT

Well, how much time? 

ELAINE

(sighs Wa-ah) I don't know...a year? 

KURT

No, no, no...it has to be now. 

ELAINE

(sighs ahh) Could I see the ring again? 

JERRY

So, you're actually considering it? 

ELAINE

Well, it'll be a couple of years before he's completely bald. Those'll be good times. 

JERRY

Marriage is a big step, Elaine. Your life'll totally change. 

ELAINE

Jerry, it's three-thirty in the morning. I'm at a cockfight. What am I clinging to? 

GEORGE

Oh, hey, sorry I'm late. 

JERRY

Hey. 

GEORGE

Sorry I'm late. 

JERRY

Where's Celia? 

GEORGE

She didn't want to come, she-she's not really into sports. 

JERRY

hmm. (nodding head) 

JERRY

Hey, how's he doin'? 

KRAMER

Ohh, He's got a big sweat going. (Takes an envelope out of his pocket.) Oh, this came for you express-mail. It's from your parents. 

JERRY

Fifty dollars. I Don't Believe This! 

KRAMER

There's Marcelino. (Marcelino enters the ring holding a huge white rooster.) 

JERRY

Look at the size of his bird! 

KRAMER

That looks like a dog with a glove on his head. 

KURT

Hi, is George back from the cockfight yet? You know, I gotta thank him, he changed my life. 

CELIA

No, it must have been a good fight, he's not back yet. 

KURT

Ah, damn. 

CELIA

Aw, man! 

KURT

I'm not George Costanza. 

ELAINE

Muchos gracias. (Turns back to Jerry and Kramer.) O.K., I got the whole scoop. Marcelino flew the bird in from Ecuador. He's 68 and 0! 

JERRY

He's a ringer! 

GEORGE

Where's the tamale guy? 

KRAMER

Little Jerry's going to get his clock cleaned. I gotta get him outta there. 

KRAMER

Lit _ tle Jer _ ry! 

JERRY

Kra _ mer! 

ELAINE

Stop _ the _ fight! 

GEORGE

Ta _ mal _ e! 

KRAMER

Ahhh, uh, uh, uh, ohuh, aaaa ouh au au au ah ah (more pecking) ah, ah, ah, Ah. 

ELAINE

Why? Why did you get into a fist fight with the cop? You were innocent! 

KURT

They thought I was George. I'm not that bald. And I have too little time left to take that kind of crap, so I, slugged him. 

ELAINE

So, how long are you gonna be in here for? 

KURT

Well, my lawyer says 14 months, but with good behavior, maybe...10? 

ELAINE

(sighs) So 10 to 14 months. 

KURT

Yeah. 

KRAMER

Well, that was alright, huh? 

EMILY

Yeah. 

KRAMER

Well, um, goodnight. 

EMILY

Goodnight. 

KRAMER

(quietly, to himself) Look at this. 

HELEN

Jerry, we can only stay four days. 

JERRY

Well, I'm upset, but we'll make the most of it. 

MORTY

Helen, did you pack my travel gym? 

HELEN

Yes. (to Jerry) Oh, your father bought a exercise device off the television. He does it every morning at four. 

MORTY

Only twenty-five minutes a day, and you can attach it to any doorknob. 

JERRY

Huh. So, I guess your travel miles are about to expire. 

HELEN

Well, actually, Jerry, we wanted to talk to you about something. 

JERRY

Am I finally getting a baby brother? 

HELEN

Jerry, be serious. 

MORTY

How would you feel if we sold the Cadillac? 

JERRY

What? The Cadillac I bought for you? 

MORTY

It's too much car, Jerry. 

JERRY

Aw, c'mon, you love that car. What about the Northstar system? 

MORTY

I don't think we even use it. 

JERRY

Well, it's a gift and I want you to keep it. 

HELEN

We already sold it. 

JERRY

Wh..why didn't you tell me before you sold it? 

MORTY

Because we had a buyer, and we couldn't get a free flight until now. 

HELEN

Well, we could, but we wanted the bulkhead. 

JERRY

(exasperated) Ugh. 

KRAMER

(to Jerry) Man, that Emily is wearing me out. 

JERRY

Kramer. 

KRAMER

No, no, no. It's not the sex, Jerry. (noticing Morty and Helen) Heyy! Seinfelds. 

HELEN

Hi Kramer. 

MORTY

Hiya Kramer. 

JERRY

We're in the middle of a discussion here. 

KRAMER

Oh yeah? What about? 

HELEN

Jerry's upset we sold the Cadillac. 

KRAMER

What'd you get for it? 

MORTY

Jack Klompus gave us six grand. 

JERRY

You sold my Cadillac to Jack Klompus? 

MORTY

(trying to press the cheque on Jerry) And we want you to have the money. 

JERRY

(getting worked up) I don't need the money. 

MORTY

What're you talking about? You had a cheque bounce at the bodega. 

JERRY

(animated) Oh, is that what this is all about?! I bounce a cheque and you sold a Cadillac?! 

HELEN

Well, also, Jerry, we read an article in the Sun Sentinel. (digs in her purse and extracts a newspaper clipping) It says standup comedy is not what it used to be, what with def jam and all. 

KRAMER

Yeah, that def jam is a force. 

HELEN

Jerry, you know, I hear wonderful things about Bloomingdales' executive training program. 

JERRY

(sits on the back of the couch) Oh my god. 

KRAMER

Y'know you've given this comedy thing your best shot. Yeah, you had some good observations, but it's over. Now, this Bloomingdale thing, that could be the next wave. 

GEORGE

Uh, excuse me. Uh, pound of Arabian mocha java, please. 

ELAINE

So, you understand how my Peterman stock options are gonna work? 

GEORGE

I'm going to the bathroom. 

ELAINE

Just, very interesting. 

JERRY

Yeah, when it's your money, it's fascinating. 

COUNTERPERSON

Arabian mocha java? 

ELAINE

(looks for George) Mmm. (can't see him) Oh, um, I got it. 

JERRY

That Arabian is strong coffee. 

ELAINE

It's PLO blend. 

ELAINE

Ohh, I got your coffee. 

GEORGE

Oh Oh, here, lemme uh... 

ELAINE

(waving away) Nah, nah, it's on me. (looks at her watch) Aww, man. Okay, listen guys, I'm gonna be late. (taking her cup of coffee) I'll see you, okay? (begins to walk away) 

GEORGE

Yeah. 

ELAINE

Bye. 

GEORGE

Mmm. 

GEORGE

You see what just happened here? 

JERRY

What? 

GEORGE

She treated me to the Arabian mocha java. 

JERRY

And you misinterpret this how? 

GEORGE

She's stickin' it to me that she makes more money than me. 

JERRY

I'm sure she was just being nice, buying you the coffee. 

GEORGE

No, not nice. She's stickin' it to me. 

JERRY

You're crazy. 

GEORGE

(worked up) Stickin' it to me, Jerry. 

JERRY

George. 

GEORGE

(angry) Stickin' it! 

GEORGE

So you're buying the car back for your parents? 

JERRY

I'm flying down to Florida tomorrow. 

GEORGE

Your parents'll never let you do it. 

JERRY

They lied to me about selling the car. I'll lie to them about buying it back. They think they can dump six grand on me? Think again. 

GEORGE

What kind of money you think your parents have? 

JERRY

Excuse me? 

GEORGE

I bet they have more money than mine. 

JERRY

Come on, your parents have money. 

GEORGE

You think? 

JERRY

When did they ever spend any money? 

GEORGE

Never. 

JERRY

What are their living expenses? 

GEORGE

Nothing. 

JERRY

Where do they ever go on vacation? 

GEORGE

Nowhere. 

GEORGE

How much money d'you think they have? 

JERRY

Few hundred grand? 

GEORGE

(excited) You're saying I stand to inherit three hundred thousand dollars, is that what you're saying?! 

JERRY

Course you may not see it for twenty years. 

GEORGE

Twenty years? That long? 

JERRY

Does your father still eat bacon and eggs every day? 

GEORGE

Fortunately, yes. 

JERRY

How's your family history? 

GEORGE

I have an aunt that died at seven. 

JERRY

Really? 

GEORGE

Aunt Baby. 

KRAMER

Elaine. Uh, you got a moment? 

ELAINE

Yeah, Kramer, come on in. 

KRAMER

I, uh, need to speak to you about some lady problems. 

ELAINE

(unsure) Oh-kay. 

KRAMER

(a little anxious) You know, after I have sex with Emily, uh, I don't want her in the bed any more. 

ELAINE

Ah. 

KRAMER

Yeah, because she's throwing off my whole sleep. She's got the jimmy legs. 

ELAINE

(confused) Jimmy legs? 

KRAMER

Jimmy leg. 

ELAINE

(grasping the concept) Ohh. 

KRAMER

So, uh, well, maybe I should just be honest with her, huh? 

ELAINE

Tell her after sex, you just want her outta there? 

KRAMER

Well, I'd say it nicely. 

ELAINE

I don't think so. 

KRAMER

Well, you know, I really like this girl and I, you know, I think if I could just work out this one thing... 

ELAINE

(interrupting) Yeah. I gotta be honest with you Kramer. You might be more than just a coupla tweaks away from a healthy relationship. 

KRAMER

Well you're not exactly zeroing in yourself, lady. 

ELAINE

(pointing to the door, angry) Alright, get out. 

ELAINE

(impatient) Get out! 

JERRY

So listen, I gotta go down to Atlantic City. I'm performing at Bally's. 

MORTY

You just heard about this today? 

JERRY

(pulling on a jacket) They had a cancellation and they instantly called me. 

HELEN

Who cancelled? 

JERRY

Carrot Top. I told you, my career's fine. 

GEORGE

I been, uh, thinking about the family. Tell me, uh, about Aunt Baby. 

FRANK

(looks up to heaven) She's deceased. 

GEORGE

(glances upwards) Yeah. Uhm, why did she die so young? 

FRANK

(looks to Estelle) She had problems. (Estelle nods) Internal. 

GEORGE

Is that common in our family? 

ESTELLE

Well, your uncle Moe, he died a young man. 

FRANK

Also internal problems. 

ESTELLE

It's that temper on your side. They're yelling and yelling, and then one day, they're all gone. 

FRANK

What about your side? Your cousin Hennie. (animated) She was sickly from the moment I met her! 

ESTELLE

(shouts) Don't you talk about Hennie! 

GEORGE

I guess you two are the lucky ones. 

FRANK

So far. 

ESTELLE

Frank, if Aunt Baby were alive today, how old would she be? 

FRANK

She'd never make it. 

EMILY

So let me get this straight. You enjoy the lovemaking... 

KRAMER

Shh, shh. 

EMILY

(quieter) Well, do you? 

KRAMER

Oh yeah, like strawberry pie. 

EMILY

Okay, but you have a problem sharing a bed with me? 

KRAMER

I know it's not what the ladies like. But without some solid sack time, I'm a zombie. 

EMILY

I don't know. 

KRAMER

(pleading) Aww, c'mon, man. Meet me halfway. 

EMILY

You're not easy, Kramer. 

KRAMER

I know. 

JACK

So, to what do I owe the pleasure of this, unannounced, visit? 

JERRY

I wanna buy back the Cadillac. 

JACK

You wanna buy it back? Why, you go drugs hidden in the trunk? 

JACK

I'm kidding. 

JERRY

(reaching into his pocket) Alright, I'll give you nine thousand for it. 

JACK

Nine thousand for a Cadillac? It's got no miles on it. 

JERRY

You bought it for six! 

JACK

You're not me. 

JERRY

(standing) How much d'you want for it? 

JACK

The Kelly blue book value. Twenty-two thousand dollars. 

JERRY

Fourteen thousand. 

JACK

Done. But, I get to drive it tomorrow, because Doris wants to go to Naples. 

JACK

Need a pen? 

JACK

Still works. 

KRAMER

Hey, where's Jerry? 

HELEN

He's performing at Bally's in Atlantic City. 

KRAMER

Aw, okay. (picks up the phone and starts dialling) Yeah, I need his shoeshine kit. (still dialling) He always hides it from me. (puts the phone to his ear and waits for a second or two) Yeah, Bally's? Yeah, Jerry Seinfeld's room, please. 

MORTY

You know that number? 

KRAMER

I used to have a problem. (into phone) Well, what d'you mean, he's not registered? Wha..S, E, I, N, V... 

HELEN

F. F, E, L , D. 

KRAMER

...F, E, L, D. (half-laughing) Well, I think you're wrong. (listens) Alright, you have a lucky day, too. 

HELEN

He's not there? 

KRAMER

No, they never heard of him. 

ELAINE

This is so nice of you to take us all out to dinner, George. 

GEORGE

(oozing fake sincerity) Well, as much as I enjoy all the good-natured ribbing, nothing really makes me happier than spending money on the people I care about. 

HELEN

Where's Jerry? 

GEORGE

Oh, he'll be here. By the way, Elaine, (reaches under the table and brings out a large coffee machine) thank you for laying out for the Arabian mocha java. 

ELAINE

George, you didn't have to do this. I'm president of a big company. I can afford to buy you coffee. 

MORTY

(surprised) President? 

ELAINE

Yeah. 

GEORGE

Hey look, he's back. 

JERRY

I got your message, (sitting) so I came straight from Atlantic City. 

HELEN

Jerry, Kramer called Bally's. You weren't registered. 

JERRY

(extemporising) Well, I can't stay under my own name. I was registered under Slappy White. 

GEORGE

Mom? Dad? 

ESTELLE

Well, look who's here. Hello, Seinfelds. 

GEORGE

Wh..what're you doing here? 

FRANK

We're having an upscale dinner. 

GEORGE

What? 

ESTELLE

Well, after talking to you, we realised we may not have much time left. 

FRANK

So, we're blowing it all. 

FRANK

(holding out his tie) Look George, it's a Pierre Cardin. 

KRAMER

That was alright. 

EMILY

Yeah. 

KRAMER

(abruptly) Well, I'll see you. 

JERRY

Hello. 

JACK

(shouting like there's a bad line) Jerry, I had a little mishap with the car. 

JACK

I'm down here in alligator alley. You better get down here. 

JERRY

(quiet) Huh. Alright. 

HELEN

Who was that? 

JERRY

(extemporising) That was the Golden Nugget. Also in Atlantic City. They heard such good things about my show at Bally's, they want me for tonight. So I'll have to repack, and go. 

MORTY

That didn't sound like the Golden Nugget. 

HELEN

I'm worried. What happens if we have to support Jerry? 

MORTY

I'd have to go back to work. 

HELEN

Where would you work? 

MORTY

Maybe I should talk to Elaine. 

ELAINE

Well, Mr Seinfeld, I..I'm not sure I understand why you want a job here. 

MORTY

What's not to understand? 

ELAINE

Well, for one thing, you live in Florida. 

MORTY

I'm very comfortable working outta the house. I have a phone, we have a Kinko's nearby. You know, I think that my resume speaks for itself. 

ELAINE

(looking around her desk) Where is your resume? 

MORTY

I don't have it. I'll mail you one. 

ELAINE

Alright, Mr Seinfeld, I... What kind of position did you have in mind? 

MORTY

You sell clothes here, don't you? 

ELAINE

Yeah. 

MORTY

Well, I sold raincoats in the garment centre for thirty-eight years. In nineteen forty-nine... 

ELAINE

(interrupting) Alright. Alright, alright. You come in tomorrow, we'll find something for you to do. 

MORTY

You won't regret this, Miss Benes. What time should I be in? I get up at four, I could be here as early as four twenty-five. 

ELAINE

Uhm... 

PETERMAN

(upbeat) Oh, Elaine, this dry air is curing me like a Black Forest ham. 

ELAINE

(stunned) Mr Peterman. You're back. 

MORTY

Who's Mr Fancy? 

KRAMER

(hesitant) I uh, I was thinking maybe I should spend the night. 

EMILY

Aww, that's sweet, but actually I, I think I'd prefer it if you left. 

KRAMER

(surprise) What? 

EMILY

You were completely right. I sleep so much better when I'm alone. (pause) And you scream in your sleep. 

KRAMER

I do? 

KRAMER

(fearful) There was a man, he was trying to get into my apartment last night. He was jiggling the doorknob for twenty-five minutes. 

EMILY

C'mon, it was probably the wind. 

KRAMER

No, no, no. It was a fearless cat burglar. (pleading) Now listen, you gotta let me sleep here, huh? Y'know, I'll stay here on my side, and I'll stuff a sock in my mouth. (panicky) 'Cos I don't wanna sleep alone. 

EMILY

(adamant) Well, I do. 

JACK

What took you so long? 

JERRY

I live in New York. (slams the cab door) What the hell happened? 

JACK

This thing is a, is a behemoth. 

JERRY

What did you do? 

JACK

I was, I was making a, a simple lane change. I, I put on the blinker and it took off on me. And the next thing you know, I was submerged. I'm telling you, Jerry, I'm very lucky that those crocs didn't get me. 

JERRY

(exasperation) You are such an idiot. Well, we gotta get the car cleaned up for my parents. 

JACK

(shrugging) Do whatever you want. It's your car. 

JERRY

My car? You drove it into the swamp! 

JACK

It drove itself into the swamp! Besides, I think I lost my pen, too. 

JERRY

(smiling with pleasure) You know, that almost makes this all worthwhile. 

GEORGE

(pointing outside) Why is there a Cadillac parked in front of the house? 

FRANK

That's your mother's new car. 

GEORGE

You bought that? 

FRANK

It's a Coupe de Elegance. 

ESTELLE

Your father wanted a Mercedes, but I won't ride in a German car. 

KRAMER

Mornin'. 

KRAMER

Oh, boy. 

GEORGE

What the hell is going on here? 

KRAMER

I had some trouble at my place, so I need a little company at night to sleep. 

ESTELLE

George, your mother and I, and Kramer (holds Kramer's hand) have been talking. 

GEORGE

(dread) Oh god. 

KRAMER

Uh, George, your parents can't blow through their savings in this community. It's low-rent. Now, we feel that Florida is really the place where they should be. 

FRANK

(claps his hands) You can drop a grand in Disneyworld, like that. 

GEORGE

Wait a minute. (astonished) You're thinking of moving to Florida again?! 

ESTELLE

Well, it's either that or we stay here, near you, and just sit on the money. What do you think we should do, Georgie? 

PETERMAN

So, anyway, effective immediately, Miss Benes will return to her old position, at her original salary... 

PETERMAN

...and I, of course, will return to mine. Kudos, Elaine, on a job... done. 

ELAINE

(hardly daring to ask) What about my stock options? 

PETERMAN

I think not. 

PETERMAN

Now, down to business. (thoughtful) I have had this vision of a diaphanous rum-runner scarf. 

ELAINE

Well, we could fly some fabric in from our silk factories, for about a thousand dollars a bolt. 

MORTY

(shocked) A thousand?! I know a coupla Chinamen over there on Forty-third Street, who'll do it for half that. 

ELAINE

(tactful) It's, ah, Asian-Americans. 

MORTY

What? 

PETERMAN

(puzzled) Who are you? 

ELAINE

Don't worry, I... 

MORTY

Morty Seinfeld. I cut velvet for forty years with Harry Altman. 

ELAINE

Okay, Mr Seinfeld, this is not the t... 

PETERMAN

Elaine, did you hire this man? 

ELAINE

(worried) No, no. Well, I mean, you know, he's more like an intern, you know, at best. 

ELAINE

So, if your parents move to Florida, you're poor. 

GEORGE

(pointing out the positive) But happy. 

ELAINE

Obviously. And if they stay, you're rich, but... 

GEORGE

Obviously. 

ELAINE

Quite a dilemma. You know, I have a bit of a dilemma of my own. 

GEORGE

No, no. No, no, no. (determined) We're staying on me. We haven't solved anything yet. 

ELAINE

Alright, this is easy. Let 'em go. 

GEORGE

What d'you mean, let 'em go? They're spending all my money. 

ELAINE

Alright, well, then they stay. Lemma ask you something... 

GEORGE

(upset) Could you put a little thought into this? Jerry's gone, you could humour me. He humours me. 

ELAINE

Speaking of Jerry, his father is driving me so crazy down at Peterman's. 

GEORGE

You know what I do at the Yankees, when one of these old guys is breathing down my neck? 

ELAINE

What? 

GEORGE

You schedule a late meeting. 

ELAINE

(puzzlement) Huh? What does that do? 

GEORGE

These old guys, they're up at 4 a.m., by two thirty they're wiped. (animated) How did we get back onto you?! 

ELAINE

(grabbing her bag and coat) I gotta split. 

GEORGE

(shouted after Elaine) You know, I got nothing outta this! 

KRAMER

Hey Frank, you got two beds in here. 

FRANK

That's right. That's me on the left. 

KRAMER

So, you sleep in separate beds. 

FRANK

Thirty years ago, we came to an agreement. It was the only way I could get some rest. 

KRAMER

(intrigued) Really? 

FRANK

(confidential) Estelle's got the (jerks his elbow) jimmy arms. 

KRAMER

You can get that in your arms? 

FRANK

Like you wouldn't believe. 

JACK

Jerry, it's getting late. You've cleaned up the car. You've made all your phone calls. Why are you still here? 

JERRY

Well, I uh, maxed out my credit cards, and I don't have enough cash for a hotel room. So... 

JACK

You are uh, thinking of staying here? 

JERRY

Well... 

JACK

(laughing) You've got some nerve. I almost break my neck in that death-trap of yours, and now you ask me for a favour! 

JERRY

You didn't like that crack about the pen. 

JACK

I did not. 

GEORGE

Well, I've given this a lot of thought, and I've gotta say... 

GEORGE

(attempting sincerity) As much as I'd like to see the two of you living it up in a warm, tropical, setting, I, I would just miss you too much. (smiling) So, I've decided, I want you to stay. 

FRANK

It's too late. We bought a condo at Del Boca Vista. We're leaving tonight. 

GEORGE

(crestfallen) But you said it was my call. 

ESTELLE

We were just being nice. 

ESTELLE

(motherly concern) Cosmo, are you sure you're gonna be alright here alone? 

KRAMER

Oh, yeah, yeah. I got Emily coming over tonight. 

GEORGE

(animated) You're letting him have a woman over?! 

FRANK

He's not family. It's different, psychologically. 

PETERMAN

And so, I made an explosive out of chick peas, and I stopped that great rhino right in his tracks. 

MORTY

Well, it's getting kinda late, why don't we uh... 

ELAINE

Mr Peterman, that can't have been the only time that you faced mortal danger. 

PETERMAN

(smiles and laughs) Ha ha ha. Funny you should ask, Elaine. 

MORTY

Look, if we're gonna stay here until all hours of the night, can we at least get some food here? 

PETERMAN

(looks at his watch) It's only five fifteen. So, later on that same day, I developed a great hankering for some wild honey... 

MORTY

(standing) Okay, I'm done. I'll be back in the morning, when he's close to finish with his story. 

PETERMAN

Morty. My stories are what sell these clothes. 

MORTY

Cheap fabric, and dim lighting. That's how you move merchandise. 

PETERMAN

(winks) Morty, you're out. 

MORTY

(unconcerned) Ach, I never knew what the hell I was peddling with those stupid cartoons and that paper book, anyway. 

KRAMER

I don't know why I let you talk me into that corned beef at Snitzer's. 

EMILY

(not looking up from her book) No-one held a gun to your head. 

KRAMER

(dismissive) Yeah. 

EMILY

(still reading) Don't forget, we're eating dinner at the Feinerman's tomorrow night. 

KRAMER

(moody) Oh, why do I have to go? They're your friends. 

EMILY

You like 'em. 

KRAMER

I've had it with 'em. 

EMILY

Then we won't go. 

KRAMER

(yielding) Okay, okay. What time? 

EMILY

Eight thirty. 

KRAMER

(satisfied) Ahh. That was alright. 

ELAINE

'One bright note in today's market, was the stock of retailer J Peterman, whose founder's surprise return generated a rise of twelve and a half points.' 

JERRY

Mmm-mmm-mmm. That means, if you still had those stock options... 

ELAINE

(downcast) Yeah. 

GEORGE

(Jerry-style) That's a shame. 

ELAINE

(sharp) What, are you sticking it to me? 

GEORGE

(innocent) What? 

ELAINE

I think you're sticking it to me. 

JERRY

Elaine, I'm sure George is just being sympathetic. 

ELAINE

(leaning forward and accusing) Stickin' it! 

JERRY

You're not alone. I'm practically broke. 

ELAINE

Really? 

JERRY

No. But, I did blow over twenty thousand on that Cadillac. 

GEORGE

(relishing) Hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm. Delicious. 

JERRY

Well, you seem happy. 

GEORGE

I am. The folks are twelve hundred miles away. (gleeful) I'm basking in the buffer zone. (looks for the waitress) 'Nother piece of pie here! 

ELAINE

So, were your parents shocked to see the Cadillac? 

JERRY

Actually, I haven't heard from 'em yet. 

ELAINE

Hmm. 

MORTY

When are we gonna tell Jerry? 

HELEN

I don't wanna worry him. We'll tell him next time we go up. 

MORTY

He thought he could buy back that Cadillac for us? He's not getting away with that. 

HELEN

Besides, that condo was too much house. 

ESTELLE

How many times can you check the car? 

FRANK

(coming away from the window) I saw a bum sleeping in a Cadillac the other day. 

ESTELLE

Why would someone break into a car to take a nap? 

FRANK

They don't nap. They make it their home. They urinate in there! 

ESTELLE

(shouts) You're driving me crazy! 

FRANK

(standing) That's it, we're going back to Queens. (claps hands) Where's my hat? 

ESTELLE

(shouts) Nooh! 

BILL

Well, if the big man wants a new scoreboard, I don't wanna be the one to tell him no. 

REILLY

No-one in the park is gonna be able to see it from there. 

GEORGE

(through a mouthful of shrimp) Well, why don't we just put a monitor in his skybox? 

REILLY

Hey George, the ocean called. They're running outta shrimp. 

GEORGE

(angry, to himself) The ocean called. Running outta shrimp. Outta shrimp! (a thought occurs) Oh! Yes! That's what I shoulda said! (frustrated shout) Dammit! 

JERRY

'The ocean called, They're running outta shrimp'? 

GEORGE

Yeah, yeah, yeah. But then, I said to him, 'Oh yeah? Well, the jerk store called, and they're running outta you.' 

JERRY

(smiling) Really? That's great. You said that to him? 

GEORGE

(confessing) Well, actually, I thought it up on the way over here. 

JERRY

Oh. That's not quite the same. 

GEORGE

No. No it's not. You don't know this guy. It woulda been so sweet. 

JERRY

I'm gonna grab a can of balls. 

GEORGE

Right. 

MILOS

Hello. My name is Milos. How can I help you. 

JERRY

I need a can of balls. 

MILOS

Can of balls for the nice guy, alri... 

MILOS

...Ahh. You don't plan to hit these balls with that racquet, do you? 

KRAMER

Checking out the staff picks, Miss Benes? 

ELAINE

Oh. (laughs) Ha-ha. Hey. Yeah, yeah. (indicating shelf) This Vincent guy, he is the best. He and I have the exact same taste in movies. 

KRAMER

Oh, Vincent is an art-house goon. I stick to the Gene rack. 

ELAINE

Gene? Oh, it's so stupid and mainstream. 

KRAMER

(indicates 'Gene' shelf) I've seen all these, so I went with a Kramer pick. 

ELAINE

(reading) 'The Other Side Of Darkness'. Huh, I never heard of that one. 

KRAMER

Yeah, went straight to video. 

KRAMER

(positive) That makes me the premiere. 

ELAINE

(gets Kramer's point) Hah. 

KRAMER

Jerry, have you ever seen the movie The Other Side Of Darkness? 

JERRY

No. 

KRAMER

It's about this woman, in a coma. Well, I couldn't finish watching it, so I want you to read this. 

JERRY

(reading) 'I, Cosmo Kramer, having just seen the movie The Other Side Of Darkness, and not wanting to be in a coma like that lady in the movie, hereby want Jerry Seinfeld to remove my life support, feeding machine, lung-blower, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.' 

KRAMER

Can you do that for me, buddy? 

JERRY

Well, I don't if what you have here constitutes a legally binding document. 

KRAMER

Well, I'm gonna type it up. 

JERRY

Yes, well, of course, but, even so, you may wanna talk to a lawyer. 

KRAMER

Yeah, but, Jackie Chiles, he put a restraining order on me. (frustrated) I'm not allowed within two hundred feet of his office. I couldn't even give him his Christmas present. 

KRAMER

Oh, hey, new racquet, huh? 

JERRY

Yeah. (hands racquet to Kramer) I wasn't gonna get it, but this guy Milos, who runs the pro shop, he really recommended it. 

JERRY

In fact, it's the only racquet he plays with. 

KRAMER

(picking up Jerry's old racquet) Well, you're not gonna need this any more. 

JERRY

(accusingly) Hey, this is the zee page of my address book. 

KRAMER

(explaining) Oh yeah, I put all your zees on the weights and measures page. 

ELAINE

(emotional) Oh. Oh, bravo, Vincent. Bravo. (sniffs) 

ELAINE

What? 

VINCENT

Did you enjoy the movie? 

ELAINE

Who is it? 

VINCENT

It's Vincent. 

ELAINE

Of Vincent's picks? 

VINCENT

The same. 

JERRY

He called you? 

ELAINE

He musta got my number off the computer. We ended up talking for, like, two hours. 

JERRY

To a guy you've never met? (mild sarcasm) Your screening process is getting ever more rigorous. 

ELAINE

Trying to meet him. He's never at the video store. They said he sets his own hours. 

PLAYER

Little help, hey! 

ELAINE

(tossing the ball back) Yeah. 

PLAYER

Thank you. 

ELAINE

(laughing to Jerry) Oh god, that guy's terrible. 

JERRY

(pulling on a jacket) Mmm-hmm. 

ELAINE

Hey, how come we played at this crummy place instead of your club? 

JERRY

George used up all my guest passes already. 

ELAINE

Ah. 

PLAYER

Ahh. 

JERRY

Come on. 

PLAYER

Thank you. 

JERRY

(tossing the ball) Here you go. 

JERRY

(disbelief) Milos? 

MILOS

(shock) Oh, hey. (puts sunglasses back on) How you doing? 

MILOS

Okay, we should uh, wrap it up here. 

ELAINE

So he was bad. What d'you care? 

JERRY

Elaine, I paid two hundred dollars for this racquet, because he said it's the only one he plays with. He could've played just as well with a log. 

KRAMER

Hey. Right, I talked to this lawyer guy, Shellbach. Now, he's gonna set me up, but you gotta come with me and be the executor. 

ELAINE

The executor? Of what? 

JERRY

Kramer wants to die with dignity. 

ELAINE

There's a feather in your cap. 

KRAMER

I don't wanna be a vegetable, Elaine. I just want out. (snaps fingers) 

GEORGE

Sometimes in life, the gods smile upon you, my friends. 

JERRY

D'you get someone to take that Canadian quarter? 

GEORGE

I got another meeting with Reilly. A whole new audience, and I bet I can get him to try that line again. 

ELAINE

Who's Reilly? 

JERRY

George was scarfing shrimp at this meeting, and this guy says 'Hey, George, the ocean called. They're running outta shrimp.' 

GEORGE

Listen to the comeback. (pleased) 'Oh yeah? Well the jerk store called. They're running outta you.' 

GEORGE

(worked up) Wha...You gotta be kidding me?! 

ELAINE

How 'bout this one? How 'bout, 'Your cranium called. It's got some space to rent.'? 

GEORGE

(confused) What does that mean? 

JERRY

(taps George's chest) Hey, here you go. 'Hey, Reilly. The zoo called. You're due back by six.' 

GEORGE

(frustrated) No. No, no, no. You're not helping me. 

KRAMER

Look, just tell him you had sex with his wife. That'll kill him. 

GEORGE

(shouting) I'm not looking for another line. I got the line. 

KRAMER

Look, George, just think about it. You know, you're married, how would you feel if somebody says to you that they just had se... 

GEORGE

(really animated) Alright, alright. You see? This is why I hate writing with a large group. Everybody has their own little opinions, and it all gets homogenised, and you lose the whole edge of it. I'm going with jerk store! Jerk store is the line! Jerk store! Yess! 

KRAMER

(picking the racquet up) Did you take this out of the garbage? 

JERRY

Yeah, it's still got some spring in the strings. 

KRAMER

Oh, Jerry, this is a piece of junk. (drops racquet in the trash) How are you gonna be the executor of my living will? 

KRAMER

(indicating) You see? You can't let go. 

JERRY

Trust me, Kramer. Given the legal opportunity, I will kill you. 

KRAMER

I wish I could believe you. Hey, Elaine, do you have some free time tomorrow afternoon? 

ELAINE

Me? 

KRAMER

Yeah, because you're perfect. You're a calculating, cold-hearted businesswoman. And when there's dirty work to be done, you don't mind stomping on a few throats. 

ELAINE

(smiling, flattered) Oh, ho, c'mon. 

SHELLBACH

Situation number four. You're breathing on your own, you're conscious, but with no muscular function. 

KRAMER

Well, would I be able to communicate? 

SHELLBACH

I don't see how. 

ELAINE

Ach, I don't like the sound of this one. 

KRAMER

Huhh, yeah, let's pull the cord. 

ELAINE

Yank it like (pops open soda can) you're starting a mower. 

SHELLBACH

Moving on. You have liver, kidneys and gall bladder, but no central nervous system. 

KRAMER

Well, I gotta have a central nervous system. 

SHELLBACH

Okay. One lung, blind and you're eating through a tube. 

KRAMER

Naw, that's not my style. 

ELAINE

Bore-ing. 

SHELLBACH

Alright, you can eat. But machines do everything else. 

KRAMER

(hesitant) Uhm... 

ELAINE

I'd stick. 

KRAMER

Yeah, yeah. Stick. (to Elaine) 'Cos I could still go to the coffee shop. 

ELAINE

(points to Kramer and smiles in agreement) That's right. 

JERRY

Hello Milos. 

MILOS

Jerry, thank god you got my message. Thank you so much for coming down here. Uhm, listen... 

JERRY

(animated) You know, I spent two hundred dollars on a racquet because I thought you knew what you were talking about. 

MILOS

I..I... 

JERRY

You can't even play. 

MILOS

Believe me, it is Milos great shame. But Jerry, I could lose my business if anybody find out. How would you like extra year membership of the club? Free. No charge. 

JERRY

You could do that? 

MILOS

Jerry, for you, anything. 

JERRY

(indicating the woman) Game, set and match, huh Milos? 

MILOS

(apologetic) Hah, Jerry, I am so sorry. they tell me there is no way they can do it. (meek) Is there anything else I can do for you? Anything at all. I refund your money. 

JERRY

(animated) You know what Milos, I don't even care about the money. I just feel like I was taken by the worst tennis player I... 

MILOS

Shhh-shhh. (whispers) I make it up to you. 

JERRY

(doubtful) Yeah, you'll make it up to me. 

JERRY

Tennis, anyone? 

ELAINE

Oh, this is the one Vincent told me about. The Pain And The Yearning. (reads from the box) 'An old woman experiences pain and yearning.' A hundred and ninety-two minutes? 

KRAMER

That's a lotta yearning, huh? 

ELAINE

You know, these movies are great, but they're just so emotionally exhausting. 

KRAMER

Yeah, well, what you need is some summertime adolescent high jinx. 

ELAINE

Really? 

KRAMER

(looking at 'Gene' rack) See what doctor Gene prescribes, huh? (pulls down a cassette) Oh, here, look at that. Weekend At Bernies Two. Now, that's an hilarious premise. 

ELAINE

(laughs) Huh. (looks from tape to tape) Well... 

KRAMER

Yeah. (taps the Weekend At Bernie's II box) 

ELAINE

Yeah, I could use a chuckle. 

KRAMER

(approving) Yeah. 

ELAINE

What're you getting? 

KRAMER

Nothing, I'm gonna finish watching The Other Side Of Darkness. 

ELAINE

Oh. How much you got left? 

KRAMER

Yeah, about two hours. 

KRAMER

Yeah, she shot in that coma pretty quick. 

ELAINE

(at TV screen) Bernie is dead, you moron! (frustration) Just because he's wearing sunglasses he looks alive?! (picks up video box) Ugh, how long is this weekend, anyway? (reads from label) Ugh! 

ELAINE

Hello. 

VINCENT

(accusing) How's the movie. Elaine? 

ELAINE

Vincent? 

VINCENT

(betrayed) The Gene pick. How could you? I thought we had something special. 

ELAINE

(defensive) No, it doesn't mean anything. I'm not even gonna rewind it. 

ELAINE

Vincent? 

FRED

Alright, let's get to it. 

GEORGE

Wha..wait a minute, wha..what about Reilly? 

FRED

Reilly doesn't work here any more. 

GEORGE

(surprise) What? I..I didn't hear about that. 

FRED

Oh, we only wake you up for the important meetings. 

PATTY

Hello. 

JERRY

Hello. Didn't I see you at the pro shop yesterday? 

PATTY

I think so. I'm Patty. Milos gave me your address. I hope you don't mind me waiting for you here. 

JERRY

(to himself) Hoh, that Milos. (to Patty) Well uh, what shall we do, uhm, care for a cup of coffee? 

PATTY

Why don't we just go up to your apartment? 

JERRY

(surprised) Alright. 

JERRY

(to himself) Gotta be an easier way. 

NURSE

Doctor, how's her coma? 

DOCTOR

Oh, exactly the same. 

DOCTOR

Wait a minute, she's coming out of the coma. 

DOCTOR

Mrs Allbright, can you hear me? Are you okay? 

ALLBRIGHT

(bright and cheerful) I feel so rested and refreshed. Get me a toothbrush. 

JERRY

So, you play tennis? 

PATTY

(putting the glass down on the counter) Enough talk, Jerry. 

JERRY

Not for me, I love chatting. 

PATTY

(putting her hand to Jerry's face) Shh. 

PATTY

(anguished) No! No, I can't do this. (moving away) I can't go through with it. (sitting on the couch) Not even for him! 

JERRY

Who? 

PATTY

(cries) Milos. My husband! 

JERRY

(shocked) Your husband?! 

GEORGE

So concerned was he, that word of his poor tennis skills might leak out, he chose to offer you his wife as some sort of mediaeval sexual payola? 

JERRY

(explanation) He's new around here. 

GEORGE

(hopeful) So, details? 

JERRY

(walking away) Well, I didn't sleep with her. 

GEORGE

Because of society, right? 

JERRY

(weary) Yes, George, because of society. So how did the big meeting turn out? 

GEORGE

Reilly is no longer with the club. (getting up) You believe that? 

JERRY

Ah, you're better off. Now you can just let it go. 

GEORGE

Yeah, I'm gonna let it go. 

JERRY

You never really had the right comeback, anyway. 

GEORGE

(animated) Are you insane? Jerk store, woulda smoked that guy! Smoked him, I say. 

KRAMER

Hey. Oh, Jerry, listen uh, you know, I saw the rest of that movie, The Other Side Of Darkness? The coma lady wakes up at the end. 

GEORGE

(frustrated) Ohh, I wanted to see that. (waves his arms in frustration) Thanks. Thanks a lot. 

KRAMER

I didn't know it was possible to come out of a coma. 

JERRY

I didn't know it was possible not to know that. 

GEORGE

(from bathroom) How was Eric Roberts as the husband? 

KRAMER

(shouting back) Oh, unforgettable. 

GEORGE

(disappointed) Oww. 

KRAMER

(nervous) I gotta find Elaine. Y'know, she's gonna pull my plug. 

ELAINE

What? Betrayed? Oh, Vincent, I'm so sorry. I... 

KRAMER

Yeah, listen, uh, Elaine, I've changed my mind about the whole coma thing. (positive) Yeah, I decided I'm up for it. 

ELAINE

Kramer, do you have any idea what you've done? 

MANAGER

Excuse me. 

ELAINE

What're you doing? 

ELAINE

Wha..wha...? 

MANAGER

Vincent stopped making picks. 

ELAINE

(upset) Well, how am I gonna know what movies to see? 

MANAGER

We have a wide variety of Gene picks. 

ELAINE

(dismissive) Gene's trash. 

MANAGER

I'm Gene. 

ELAINE

(forcing a smile) Hi. 

JERRY

Milos, I can assure you, I had no intention of telling anyone about your unbelievably bad tennis playing. 

MILOS

(not cheered) Thank you, but, unfortunately, I have much larger problems to fry. My wife, she has no respect for Milos anymore. 

JERRY

I guess that's a risk you run when you dabble in the flesh trade. 

MILOS

Patty, she, she loves tennis, as much like I do. (hopeful) Wou..would you, wi..will you let me beat you in tennis? That is the only way I can show her I am still a man. 

JERRY

(reluctant) Well, I'll do it as long as there's no other girls around. I mean, I wanna be a man too. 

JERRY

So you hurt Vincent's feelings? 

ELAINE

(handing Jerry an envelope) Look what came in the mail today. 

JERRY

(taking the envelope) Wh..What's this? 

ELAINE

It's the play button, off his VCR. 

JERRY

(examining the button) Boy, look how far back it goes. It's like a tooth. 

GEORGE

(sitting) So, guess where Mr 'Ocean phoned' turned up? He's working for Firestone, in Akron, Ohio. 

ELAINE

Ohio? 

GEORGE

Yep. I'm leaving first thing tomorrow morning. 

JERRY

(nonplused) You're flying to Akron, just to zing a guy? 

GEORGE

Don't you understand? It's not about him. To have a line as perfect as 'jerk store' and to never use it. I, I couldn't live with myself. 

ELAINE

See, there are no jerk stores. It..it's just a little confusing, is all. 

GEORGE

(adamant) It's smart. It's a smart line, and a smart crowd will appreciate it. (shouting) And, I'm not gonna dumb it down for some bonehead mass audience! 

GEORGE

(waving apologetically) Not you. 

WOMAN

Oh, brittle bones. How I long to be rid of the pain. 

ELAINE

Hello. 

VINCENT

Elaine? It's Vincent. 

ELAINE

(surprised) Vincent. (pleading) Where are you? I have to meet you. 

VINCENT

No. I can't bear to have anyone see me. 

ELAINE

Vincent, listen, I won't judge you the way everyone else does. You're, you're strange and beautiful, and sensitive. (blunter) Now, let's have a look at you. 

VINCENT

(relenting) Alright, but, can you bring me few things from the store? I haven't been out in a while. 

KRAMER

(indicating that cars should pass him) Well, go around, you bunch of crazies. You maniacs are gonna get us all killed. 

SECRETARY

Hi, can I help you? 

KRAMER

Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm Cosmo Kramer. Yeah, I had an appointment to annul my living will. 

SECRETARY

Oh. (looks at her watch) Mr Kramer, you had a ten-thirty appointment. It's two o'clock. Mr Shellbach had a tennis lesson. He's gone for the day. 

JERRY

Too good. 

MILOS

(triumphant shout) Another game for Milos!! Hahaha! 

JERRY

You're on fire today. 

MILOS

(shouting over) Hey Patty. look at this guy. He's awful! 

MILOS

(milking it) He's not a man, this Jerry. He's not even married like I am. (laughs) Huhuhuhu. 

JERRY

(quietly) Hey, uh, Milos, I don't mind rolling over here, but could you lighten up on the 'not a man' stuff? 

MILOS

(shouting) Hey everybody, look! The little chicken girl wants me to ease up. He can't handle this, so he cries like a woman! (laughs evilly) Hahaha! 

ELAINE

Hello? Vincent? 

VINCENT

Elaine? 

ELAINE

I got what you asked. 

VINCENT

Just, leave it and go. 

ELAINE

W..well, can't I come in? 

VINCENT

No. Go away. Now. 

ELAINE

(pleading) No, no. Vincent, I... Don't shut me out. (beseeching) I just, I know you feel what I feel. 

WOMAN

Excuse me. Can I help you? 

VINCENT

Aw, dammit! 

ELAINE

(confused) Uh, uhm, I'm, I'm here to see Vincent. 

WOMAN

Well, I'm his mother. (stern) Vincent, what's going on here? 

VINCENT

(shrieks) No, my acne! 

ELAINE

Ahh-cnee. 

WOMAN

(regarding the grocery bag) What d'you have here? 

WOMAN

(disapproving) Vodka, cigarettes, fireworks. (accusing) What kind of a sick woman brings this to a fifteen year old? 

ELAINE

(sick smile) We have the same taste in movies. 

WOMAN

Did he send you part of our VCR? 

ELAINE

Yeah. 

WOMAN

(entering the apartment) Vincent! 

MILOS

(pointing and shouting) Look at the big baby! (laughter) Hehaha. (to Jerry) Hey, big baby, are you wetting yourself? Maybe it is time for you to be changed. (laughter) Hahah. 

JERRY

(quietly) I told you to cut it out. 

MILOS

(quietly, to Jerry) Hey, c'mon, what're you doing? (to his audience) 

KRAMER

(waving) Shellbach. 

KRAMER

Racquet. 

REILLY

So, George. You're proposing a snow tyre day at Yankee Stadium? 

GEORGE

(through a mouthful) Long as they don't throw 'em on the field. (laughs) Huhu. (indicating dish) Help yourself to some shrimp, I brought enough for everybody. 

MCADAM

(doubtful) I have to say this, this proposal doesn't make a whole lot of sense. 

GEORGE

Well, you never know. (picks up more shrimp) Let's see how many I can fit in my mouth. 

REILLY

(leaning forward) You know, George... 

REILLY

The ocean called. They're running outta shrimp. 

GEORGE

(standing) Oh yeah, Reilly? (smugly) Well, the jerk store called. They're running outta you 

REILLY

(unperturbed) What's the difference? You're their all-time best seller! 

GEORGE

Yeah? Well, I had sex with your wife. 

MCADAM

His wife is in a coma. 

ELAINE

(to Jerry) Hi. (indicating Kramer) How's he doing? 

JERRY

He's been sleeping a lot. He's still groggy. 

ELAINE

Oh. (puts the VCR down) I thought a movie might cheer him up. I got him a Gene pick. 

JERRY

What happened to Vincent? 

ELAINE

(evasive) I'm kinda off of him. (looking around) Uh, outlet? 

ELAINE

Ah. 

KRAMER

(screaming) Waahhh!!! 

GEORGE

'My wife's in a coma.' Yeah? Well, the life support machine called and... 

GEORGE

(shouts) Wait! Yes! That's what I should've said! (frustration) D'ohh! 

GEORGE

(cocky laughter) Huh haha! (shouts) You're meat, Reilly! You just screwed yourself! (laughter) Ha ha! 

ELLEN

So, they have this clock now, where you punch in your age, and all your risk factors. It actually counts down how much time you have left to live. 

JERRY

So what's the great moment? You're on your death bed, they're pounding on your chest - and you're going 10, 9, 8,.. I told you this thing was good! 

ELLEN

(Laughs) I can't believe this is our first date. 

JERRY

I know.. How about dessert? 

ELLEN

I suppose I have to get a piece of cake.. 

JERRY

Why? 

ELLEN

Today's my birthday. 

JERRY

What? Today? Really? 

ELLEN

Yeah. 

GEORGE

So, she went out with you on a first date.. and it was her birthday? 

JERRY

Yeah. And she picked the day! 

GEORGE

Is she socially awkward? 

JERRY

No, she's great! She's.. attractive, she's fun.. 

GEORGE

Well, maybe she decided to celebrate her birthday on the Monday after the weekend. 

JERRY

She's not Lincoln. 

KRAMER

Hey! Anybody up for Lorenzo's pizza? 

JERRY

I'll pass. 

KRAMER

Oh, yeah? Huh. (Turns to George) Hey, George! Pizza? Yum, yum! 

GEORGE

Eh, I can't. I gotta go down to the foundation. I'm interviewing high schoolers for the Susan Ross.. scholarship. 

JERRY

Does it ever bother you that this organization- 

GEORGE

Nope! 

JERRY

is beating the bushes- 

GEORGE

Nope! (Starts heading for the door) 

JERRY

to basically give this money away- 

GEORGE

Noo! 

JERRY

to virtually anyone, as long as they're not you? 

GEORGE

(Standing in the doorway) I'm fine with it! Fi-hi-hi-hine I say! (Leaves) 

GEORGE

Quick, what's your favorite animal? 

GEORGE

(Disappointed) A frog? 

GEORGE

(Annoyed) Frog is wrong. 

GEORGE

(Reading) I see here that you play the harp.. tell me, why do you have to tilt it? Can't you just build it on an angle? It'd save you a lot of trouble. 

GEORGE

(Annoyed) Yeah, yeah. We'll, uh, let you know. 

GEORGE

(Reading) I see your G.P.A's a 4.0. 

GEORGE

so, uh, Steven.. I see you're president of the chess club. 

STEVEN

State champs. 

GEORGE

Who's your favorite chess player? 

STEVEN

(Hesitating, he mumbles) Nastercoff? 

GEORGE

Right. (Mumbles) Nastercoff.. What country is he from, again? 

STEVEN

(Sighs) I don't know.. I made it up. (Gets up to leave) I'm never gonna get this thing. 

GEORGE

(Gets up, stopping him) Woah, woah, woah! What are you telling me for? You really had me going, there! C'mon, sit down. (They both sit back down) What do you want to do when you grow up? 

STEVEN

I've been telling people that I'd like to be an architect.. 

ELAINE

So, get this: Mister Peterman is finally letting me do some real writing. He's got this book deal, for his autobiography. He's gonna let me ghost write it. 

JERRY

Wow. That's great! When it comes out, I'll have to get someone to ghost read it. 

KRAMER

Hey. 

JERRY

Hey. 

ELAINE

Hey! 

KRAMER

Alright, so there I am at Lorenzo's - loading up my slice of the fixin's bar.. garlic, (imitates the shaking of garlic onto a pizza) and what-not.. mmm, mmm.. and I see this guy over at the pizza boxes giving me the stink-eye. (Imitates the 'stink-eye') So I give hime the crook-eye back, (Imitates the 'crook-eye') you know.. Then, I notice that he's not alone! I'm taking on the entire Van Buren Boys! 

JERRY

The Van Buren Boys? There's a street gang named after President Martin Van Buren? 

KRAMER

Oh yeah, and they're just as mean as he was! So, I make a move to the door, you know, (makes a noise) they block it! So, I lunged for the bathroom. (demonstrates) I grab the knob - Occupado! Then they back me up agains the cartoon map of Italy, and all of the sudden, they just stop. 

ELAINE

What? What happened? 

KRAMER

Because I'm still holding the garlic shaker.. Yeah.. like this (grabs Jerry's peper shaker, and demonstrates) I'm only showing eight fingers. 

JERRY

Well, what does that mean? 

KRAMER

That's their secret sign! See, Van Buren, he was teh eighth President.. (Holds up 8 fingers) They thought I was a former Van B. Boy! 

ELLEN

(Sees a pay phone) Oh, Jerry, can you hold on a sec? I just want to check my messages.. (She meets up with two of her friends on the way to the phone) Oh, Melissa! Kim! 

MELISSA

Ellen. 

ELLEN

Hey! You guys, I want you to meet Jerry. (Gestures tward Jerry, then goes back to the phone) 

MELISSA

Ohh, we've heard a lot about you! (Confidentially) It is so sweet of you to take her out. 

KIM

Yeah, you don't even know how much she needs this. 

JERRY

(Sympathetically) She coming of a bad break-up? 

KIM

(Casually) No. 

MELISSA

See ya! 

JERRY

Any messages? 

ELLEN

Yeah, no one called. 

JERRY

They act like it was some act of charity. Just going out with her. 

GEORGE

So, she's the loser of the group. Every group has someone that they all make fun of.. Like us with Elaine. (Jerry thinks about this, then shakes it off) 

JERRY

There is no way Ellen is the loser of that group. 

GEORGE

Are you looking deep down at the real person underneath? 

JERRY

No, I'm being as superficial as I possibly can! 

GEORGE

(Changing subject) Hey, I htink I may have found someone for the scholarship. 

JERRY

Yeah? 

GEORGE

I'm interviewing all these annoying little overachievers.. finally, this kid walks in - Steven Koren - a regular guy.. likes sports.. watches T.V.. 

JERRY

Is he smart? 

GEORGE

(Defensively) He knows how to read. And he also knows finishing an entire book doesn't prove anything. And get this: he's into architecture. 

JERRY

Hey! Just like you pretend to be. 

GEORGE

Yes. With a little guidance, Steven Koren is going to be everything I claim to be, only for real. That's my dream, Jerry. 

JERRY

I had a dream last night that a hamburger was eating me! 

ELAINE

Mister Peterman, thanks for having me over. Your place isn't quite what I imagined.. (It's plain, with no sign of Peterman's personality) 

PETERMAN

Ohhh.. It's just a place to flop. (Sits in his recliner) 

ELAINE

Well, (Clears throat) what part of your life (hits the record button on a mini-recorder, and sets it down on the table) do you want to start with? Foreign intrigue? Exotic romances? 

PETERMAN

Oh, Elaine, we've covered all of that in the catalogue ad nauseum. No, I would like this book to be about my day-to-day life. 

ELAINE

Oh. 

PETERMAN

(Turns on the T.V, and starts flipping through the channels) Oh damn. They changed the cable stations again.. just when I finally memorized them. 

ELAINE

Well, Mister Peterman, do you want to, um.. 

PETERMAN

(Still flipping through the channels) 2.. CBS.. 

ELAINE

get, um, started.. 

PETERMAN

3.. I don't know what that is.. where's my damn preview channel? 

ELAINE

(After observing Peterman's home life) Well, I - I got ta tell you, Mister Peterman.. I don't think I see a whole book here. 

PETERMAN

well, I'm sure we'll come up with something. What do you say you and I order ourselves a pie? Do you like Lorenzo's? 

ELAINE

You know, a friend of mine almost got beat up at that place by the Van Buren Boys? 

PETERMAN

(Interested) You don't say. 

ELAINE

Yeah. The only think that saved him is that he accidentally flashed their secret gang sign. 

PETERMAN

Well, that's pretty exciting. (Pause) Let's put that in the book. 

ELAINE

But, that didn't happen to you. 

PETERMAN

So, we pay off your friend, and it becomes a Peterman. 

ELAINE

No, I - I really don't think you can do that. 

PETERMAN

(Looking at his dying plant) Ohh, damn. I forgot to buy plant food again.. I'll bet I got a coupon for it. (Starts looking through a small coupon box) 

ELAINE

You know what? Maybe I better talk to my friend. 

JERRY

Is that the same outfit you were wearing yesterday? 

ELLEN

No, this is brand new. Do you like it? 

JERRY

Actually, yeah. (Pause) Wait a second! Is that the fork that fell on the floor?! (Dramatically) Are you using the fork that fell on the floor?! 

ELLEN

(Laughs) No, Jerry, the waitress game be another one. 

JERRY

I guess that's all right. 

ELLEN

Is something wrong, Jerry? 

JERRY

No, absolutely nothing. (They get up to leave) You're fantastic! (They meet up with Kramer and George on the way out) Hey guys! 

GEORGE

Hey. 

JERRY

(Gesturing to Ellen) Kramer, George, this is Ellen. 

GEORGE

Ladies and gentlemen, this (Opens the door, Steven is standing there) is Steven Koren. His G.P.A. is a solid 2.0! Right in that meaty part of the curve - not showing off, not falling behind. 

WYCK

George, the quailifications for this scholarship were suppose to be.. largely academic. 

GEORGE

I'm sure we're all aware of the flaws and biases of standardized tests.. 

WYCK

These aren't standardized tests - these are his grades. 

GEORGE

Besides, Steven Koren has the highest of aspirations. He wants to be (pauses for effect) an architect. 

WYCK

Is that right? 

STEVEN

Actually, maybe I could set my sights a little bit higher. 

GEORGE

(Laughs) Steven, nothing is higher than an architect. 

STEVEN

I think I'd really like to be a city planner. (Sits down, addressing the entire foundation board) Why limit myself to just one building, when I can design a whole city? 

WYCK

Well, that's a good point. 

GEORGE

(Mutters) No, it's not. 

STEVEN

Well, isn't an architect just an art school drop-out with a tilty desk, and a big ruler? (Laughs - so do the board members) 

GEORGE

(Irritated) It's called a T-square. 

WYCK

You know, the stupidest guy in my fraternity became an architect - after he flunked out of dental school! (Everyone but George laughs) Contratulations, young man. (Shakes Steven's hand) 

STEVEN

Thank you. 

WYCK

Susan would be proud of what you're doing. 

STEVEN

Thank you. 

KRAMER

And they made it their sign, because, Van Buren, our 8th President, was the man they most admired. 

PETERMAN

(Laughs) Kramer, my friend, that is one ripping good yarn.. (Hands Kramer a check) 

KRAMER

You know, if you like that one, I got more.. what are you looking for? Romance? Comedy? Adventue? .. Erotica? (Clicks his tongue) 

ELAINE

No, uh, Kramer. I don't think - 

PETERMAN

(Interrupting) How much would you take for the whole lot? 

KRAMER

My whole lot? 

PETERMAN

Name your price, man! 

KRAMER

(Thinks) 1500 dollars. 

PETERMAN

I'll give you half that. 

KRAMER

(Excited) Done! 

PETERMAN

Kramer, my friend, (Gestures to Elaine) consider Elaine at your disposal. 

KRAMER

Okay.. (To Elaine) Well, I, Uh.. I like to work in the evenings.. (Elaine slumps back, and covers her head in misfortune) 

ELAINE

Would you please just get on with the stupid Bob Saccamano story?! 

KRAMER

Well, I'm on the phone with Bob, and I realize right then and there that I need to return this pair of pants. So, I'm off to the store. 

ELAINE

What happened to Bob Saccamano? 

KRAMER

Well, nothing. His part of the story is done. (Elaine covers her face with her hands - showing her difficulty coping with Kramer) So I'm waiting for the subway, It's not coming, so I decided to hoof it through the tunnel. 

ELAINE

Alright, well, now that's something.. 

KRAMER

Well, I don't know if I lost track of time - or what, but the next think I knew.. 

ELAINE

(Adding) A train is bearing down on you?! 

KRAMER

No, I slipped - and fell in the mud. Ruining the very pants I was about to return. 

ELAINE

(Reflects on the story) I don't understand.. you were wearing the pants you were returning? 

KRAMER

Well, I guess I was.. 

ELAINE

(Still confused) What were you gonna wear on the way back? 

KRAMER

Elaine, are you listening?! I didn't even get there! (Pauses) All right, next story.. 

ELAINE

Alright, I think I got enough for one day. 

KRAMER

Yeah, yeah, chew on that. 

ELAINE

(Mocking) Yeah, I'll chew on that. 

KRAMER

Oh, hey, listen, by the way - I'm hosting a little get-together tonight in honor of my little financial upturn.. 

ELAINE

Oh, thanks. I've got plans. 

KRAMER

Elaine, you should be there to document it. 

ELAINE

(Putting on her coat) Oh, you're getting together with some of your jackass friends, and you want me to take notes? 

KRAMER

Yeah, but get there after nine. You know, give the poeple a chance to loosen up. 

JERRY

So you're denying him the scholarship just because he wants to be a city planner? 

GEORGE

I was betrayed! That kid was like a son to me. And if there's one person you should be able to hold down, it's your own flesh and blood. Like my father.. my father's father before him. 

JERRY

You know, maybe philanthropy is not your field. (Phone rings, he answers it) Hello. Oh, Hi, Ellen. Yeah, I called the hotel.. we're all set for the weekend. 

GEORGE

You're spending the weekend with Ellen? 

JERRY

(To George, in a 'cha-ching!' motion) Vermont! (To Ellen) With any luck, they said we could stay an extra couple of days if we want to! (George is disturbed. He gets up, goes go Kramer's door, and knocks. They talk) Four days at a beautiful bed-and-breakfast! I can't wait.. buy-bye. (Hangs up. George and Kramer come into Jerry's apartment, confronting him) What? (George takes the phone off the hook) What is this? 

GEORGE

(To Kramer) You want to start? 

KRAMER

(To George) Uh, No, no, no.. you go ahead. I gotta get my thoughts together. 

GEORGE

Jerry, this whole Ellen situation.. has gone far enough. 

JERRY

What?! 

KRAMER

(Adding) Jerry, she's a loser. (George points to Kramer - gesturing that he's right on target) 

JERRY

Where is this coming from? She's great! 

GEORGE

(Concerned) Why're you doing this, Jerry? Is it your career? Things will pick up. 

JERRY

There's nothing wrong with my career! 

KRAMER

(Like a parent) Well, I still like the Bloomingdale's executive training program for him. 

GEORGE

I though we said we weren't going to discuss that now! 

KRAMER

Well, you know, I think it's something he should consider. 

GEORGE

Of course he should consider it, but now is not the time! 

KRAMER

Listen, George, all these issues are interrelated. 

JERRY

(Fed up) Alright! Excuse me! (Gets up) I'm not buying any of this! 

KRAMER

All right, so what're you saying? That we're wrong? Oh, everybody's wrong but you! 

JERRY

You know, this is liek that Twilight Zone where the guy wakes up, and he's the same - but everyone else is different! 

KRAMER

Which one? 

JERRY

They were all like that! 

STEVEN

Why'd you take away my scholarship, Mister Costanza? 

GEORGE

Well, Steven, I, uh.. (All the sudden, a small gang steps out of nowhere, surrounding George) 

STEVEN

These are my new friends - The Van Buren Boys. 

GEORGE

Oh.. nice. 

STEVEN

I want my scholarship back, so I can be a city planner. 

GEORGE

What about architect, Steven? 

KRAMER

Yeah, well, you got that straight! (Turns to Elaine) Hey, Elaine, try the beef - because that's realy au jus sauce, huh. (Dramatically) Real au jus sauce! 

ELAINE

(Sourly) I'll make a note of it. 

KRAMER

Yeah? 

KRAMER

Ohh kay! Well, you know, I had Bob Saccamano on the phone, and I suddenly realized that I- (Elaine stops him) 

ELAINE

You can't tell that story now. It belongs to Peterman. 

KRAMER

What do ya mean? 

ELAINE

You signed the release. 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

ELAINE

He sat in mud. Not you. 

KRAMER

But I did sit in mud. 

ELAINE

(Stern) Ya didn't! You never sat in mud! 

KRAMER

(Pleading) I was all dirty! 

ELAINE

It ever happened! Understand? 

KRAMER

(To crowd) Hey, hey, hey! All right! Yeah, uh, yeah.. well.. Uh, the pants. they, uh, they fit, uh, well - and so I, uh, decided I wasn't gonna return them! (Laughs) Wooh-hoo-hoo-hoo! 

KRAMER

What? You're gonna go now? Hey, woah! I don't.. (watches his friends leave) 

KRAMER

(Frantic) Kramer, Kramer! I got big trouble with the - with the Van Buren Boys. 

KRAMER

Hey, now, they're tough cookies. 

GEORGE

Yeah, and I - I heard you got on their good side. Now, what'd you do? 

KRAMER

Uh.. ah, (Looks over at Elaine, and realizes he can't tell the Van Buren Boys story) Oh, nothing - nothing.. No, I certainly don't have any stories, if that's what you're implying. (Laughs heartily) 

GEORGE

(Frantic) Kramer, do you know what those guys are gonna do to me?! 

KRAMER

Yeah, well, uh.. you know uh, you didn't hear from me, but, uh, the Van Buren Boys - they never hassle their own kind. 

GEORGE

You mean, like, a former member? 

ELAINE

These Kramer stories are unusable! (Thumbs through them) I mean, some of them aren't even stories! (Holds one out) Look, this is a list of things in his apartment! 

JERRY

Is my toaster oven on there? 

ELAINE

How am I ever gonna turn this into a book? 

JERRY

Well, just shape them - change them. You're a writer. 

ELAINE

Yes! I'm a writer. 

JERRY

Make them interesting. 

ELAINE

Interesting! Of course! People love interesting writing! 

JERRY

Well, I gotta go to the airport. I'm picking up my parents. 

ELAINE

What? Wheren't they just here? 

JERRY

Yeah. I'm flying them in to meet Ellen. I don't know where to turn! I gotta see what they think of her. 

ELAINE

Maybe we could all have dinner later? 

JERRY

I don't think so. I'm gonna try to get them to fly right back tonight. 

KRAMER

Oh, hey! Hey, have I told you about my bunions? Oh, you're gonna love this story! (Rubs his hands together) So, I line up my cold cuts on the couch next to me, but as I'm stacking them up, they keep falling into my foot bath! (Jerry and Elaine look disgusted) 

JERRY

Kramer, this is awful! We don't want to hear about this! 

KRAMER

Damn! 

JERRY

What? 

KRAMER

Oh, I bought a bunch of bunion stories from Newman - but they all stink! 

ELAINE

How much did you pay for them? 

KRAMER

Eight bucks! I think I got ripped off! (Leaves, yelling out 'Newman!') 

ELAINE

Oh, what didn't you like about the first chapter? 

PETERMAN

Well, it started out nicely: 'I'm returning some pants.' A very identifiable problem.. (turns page) 'I set of down a train tunnel.'.. (turns page) But that's where the story takes a most unappealing turn. 

ELAINE

Oh, no, no! That's where it gets interesting! Don't you see? The - the train is bearing down on you, you - you dive into a side tunnel - and you run into a whole band of underground tunnel dwellers! 

PETERMAN

It just seems so cliched, and obvious. It's not interesting writing. 

ELAINE

Yeah.. yeah. I know. Um.. how about if, instead of.. diving from the train, you.. uh, you, I don't know, you slip and, and fall in some mud, and.. ruin your pants? 

PETERMAN

(Intrigued) The very pants I was returning. That's perfect irony! Elaine, that is interesting writing! (The intercom beeps) 

SECRETARY

I have a Cosmo Kramer on line 4. 

PETERMAN

(Picks up the phone) Peterman, here. 

KRAMER

Mister Peterson, you gotta sell me my stories back! 

PETERMAN

You want to know something? I no longer need them! 

ELAINE

No, no. Mister Peterman, why don't we keep them - as a, as a reference? 

PETERMAN

Nonsense! (To Kramer) I have Benes' woderfully imaginative mind to spin my stories. You take back your tales, you vagabond! 

KRAMER

Yippie-yi-yay! 

PETERMAN

(Hangs up) There you are, Elaine. Go forth, and create. (Elaine gets up to leave) And, by the way, when you get to that chapter about my romantic escapades - feel free to toss yourself in the mix. 

GEORGE

Hey, Van B. Boys. 

STEVEN

So, Mister Costanza, did you get my scholarship back? 

GEORGE

Now, fellas, fellas.. easy. You wouldn't want to beat up on one of your own. 

GEORGE

Right.. the sign. (Hesitates, then makes a series of stupid gestures) 

STEVEN

That's not the sign. 

GEORGE

(Defensively loud) It was when I was banging! 

GEORGE

Love to! (Cracks his knuckles, then winces under the pain) 

ELLEN

And after college, I got my masters at the Sorbonne. 

MORTY

Sorbonne? Oh, hey. (To Helen) That's in Paris. 

ELLEN

(Looks at her watch) Oh, Jerry, you're parking meter's about to expire. Don't get up, I've got change. (Leaves with her purse) 

JERRY

(To his parents) So? What do you think? 

HELEN

Jerry, she's fantastic. 

JERRY

I knew it! I'm not crazy. 

HELEN

She's so sweet, and she's got some body on her! 

MORTY

And smart! Like a computer! 

HELEN

And so much personality! But, it doesn't matter what we think. Do you like her? 

JERRY

(After seeing how much his parents like her) Now, I'm not so sure. 

HELEN

Well, she's 10 times better than that awful Amber girl that you were with. 

JERRY

yeah, Amber.. I wonder if she's back from Vegas.. 

GEORGE

Alright, alright! (Goes out onto the sidewalk. The Seinfelds walk by) Seinfelds! 

MORTY

Hey, George! 

GEORGE

Shhh! Listen, you gotta do me a favor. Give me your wallet. I'll give it back to you later. 

MORTY

How're your folks? 

GEORGE

Eh, they're trying to pick out a new couch - you don't want to know. (Remembering the watching Van Buren Boys) Give me your wallet, or I'll spill your guts right here on the street! 

MORTY

What did you say? 

GEORGE

Come on, hurry up, old man! I'm an animal! 

HELEN

You're being very rude. Come on, Morty. 

GEORGE

(Pleading) Please, please, they're gonna hit me! (Attempts to grab Helen's purse, she starts hitting George defensively, he backs off) 

MORTY

Tell your parents we said 'Hi!' (They leave) 

KRAMER

Look how dark it's gettin' already. 

JERRY

Well, it's not Daylight Savings Time yet. 

KRAMER

When does it start? 

JERRY

(pause) I don't know, they just tell you the night before. 

KRAMER

Uh. Well, I'm sick o' waiting. (pulls out his pocket-watch (it has a chain, too)) I am springin' ahead riiight now. 

JERRY

(under breath) Oh, I'm sure that won't cause any problems.. 

JERRY

Oh, god, it's Mike Moffit.. 

KRAMER

Oh now, don't tell me you're still mad at him for calling you a phony. Jerry, that was five years ago! 

JERRY

I'm not a phony an' I don't want anything to do with this guy. 

KRAMER

Hey! Mike! 

MIKE

(sees and is enthused, coming over) Kramer! Jerry! How's it goin'?! 

JERRY

Fine. An' I'm not just sayin' that.. 

MIKE

Guess what? I just started my own business. I'm a bookie! 

JERRY

No openings in arson? 

MIKE

(pauses, struck by J's attitude) Either of you guys wanna place a bet: I'm your guy. 

KRAMER

(quickly) Ah no no no. No bets for me, I uh, I got a disease. 

JERRY

I'm feelin' a bit queasy myself. Maybe I'll see you in another five years. (casually leaves) 

MIKE

Kramer. Jerry still mad about that 'phony' thing? 

KRAMER

You kidding? It's all water near a bridge. 

MIKE

Hey, what time you got? 

KRAMER

(pulling out his timepiece) Oh yes. Uh.. it's aaalmost six. 

MIKE

Whoa--uh--I'm really late. (leaves) 

ELAINE

Oh! These designs look great! Peggy, you really saved me. 

PEGGY

Oh, it was no problem. 

ELAINE

(leaving with the drawings) Mr. Peterman is gonna love 'em. 

PEGGY

(focusing on her work) Thanks, Susie. 

ELAINE

You won't believe this but, as I'm leaving, she calls me 'Susie.' 

JERRY

I don't see you as a Susie. Sharon maybe. 

ELAINE

What am I, a--a bulimic, chain-smoking, stenographer from Staten Island? 

JERRY

Who are you describing? 

ELAINE

Someone I know. 

JERRY

Named Sharon? 

ELAINE

I'd rather not say. 

GEORGE

Hey. 

ELAINE

(to say hello) Mmm! What's in the bag? 

GEORGE

(sitting) Newww tuxedo. For the Pinstripe Ball. Steinbrenner is throwing a huge party at Tavern on the Green, heh! 

JERRY

Kind of a Yankee prom? 

GEORGE

(resentfully dampened) It's not a prom. It's a Ball. 

JERRY

You taking Allison? 

GEORGE

Yes, of course I'm taking Allison. This woman is genetically engineered to go to a ball. Tall, blonde, lithe-- 

JERRY

Live? 

ELAINE

Lithe. 

GEORGE

Live? 

ELAINE

(rolling her eyes) Lithe! 

JERRY

Oh, lithe! 

ELAINE

Well, you two'll have a great time there. 

JERRY

It can't be worse than this. 

ELAINE

Mmm! 

GEORGE

An' wait'll you see the dress that she's got. It's backless! Uh?! I'm finally gonna make a Great Entrance! 

ELAINE

Backless? Ya gonna back her in? 

GEORGE

Elaine, when a woman makes a Ball Entrance.. she twirls. 

ELAINE

She's not gonna twirl-- 

GEORGE

She'll Twirl. 

GEORGE

That is what Mr. Steinbrenner wants. He wants, everyone, ta, twirl around. 

ALLISON

(weary) All right. 

GEORGE

Hey! Uh--listen--did you get your--uh--boss's Knick ticket, for Kramer? 

ALLISON

(digging in purse) Yeah, uh--here. (hands him ticket) 

GEORGE

Oh! Great! 

ALLISON

Uh. Say, George-- 

GEORGE

Woo! Courtside! (mock-snide) Is that the best you could do? Ha ha! 

ALLISON

(sitting) George. We need to talk. 

GEORGE

What? 

ALLISON

I really, think we need to talk. 

GEORGE

(pause) Uh-oh. 

JERRY

She wants to talk. 

GEORGE

She doesn't Want to talk, she needs to talk. 

JERRY

Nobody needs to talk. 

GEORGE

Who would Want to. She tried to end it with me, Jerry. 

JERRY

What'd ya do? 

GEORGE

I told her I was out o' soda, I went out to get some, an' I never went back. 

JERRY

(pause) All night?! 

GEORGE

Yeah, I slept at my parents' house. 

JERRY

And she wants to break up with you.. 

GEORGE

Ha! (snort) Can you believe it? (amused) I'm supposed to be havin' lunch with her right now at Pomodoro. 

JERRY

Uh-oh. 'Everybody breaks up at Pomodoro's.' 

GEORGE

So? What'm I gonna do? 

JERRY

You really like this girl. 

GEORGE

No. I like the ball! This is my One Chance to make a Great Entrance! My whole life! I have never made a great entrance! 

JERRY

You've made some Fine Exits. 

GEORGE

(admitting) All right.. 

JERRY

So what do you do? You can't keep avoiding her. 

GEORGE

(resolved) Why not. (determined) If she can't find me, she can't break up with me. And, if we're still goin' out, she has to gooo to the ballll. 

KRAMER

(suddenly entering) Hey, oh--listen. Did you get my ticket from Allison-- 

GEORGE

Yeah, yeah, right here. (hands it to him) 

KRAMER

All right! Yeah.. Courtside.. Whoa! Don't let this girl get away.. 

GEORGE

(clipping on shades) Ha.. She'll have to find me first. (leaving) 

KRAMER

(All right.) (to Jerry) Ah? Oh, by the way: you owe Mike a hundred dollars. 

JERRY

What for? 

KRAMER

Well I put a bet down for ya on tonight's game. Yeah, if the Knicks beat the Pacers by more than thirty-five? It pays ten to one. Oo-oo! That's some sweet action! 

JERRY

But I don't want any 'sweet action.' 

KRAMER

Well, I couldn't do it: I got a gamblin' problem. 

JERRY

So you put down my money?! 

KRAMER

(impatient sigh) You don't have a problem. 

JERRY

Not (with) that, no.. 

PEGGY

Susie. Susie! 

ELAINE

(coming in) Uh.. Hi, Peggy. Um.. Look, I should have said this yesterday, but-- 

PEGGY

Did you get this memo from Elaine Benes? 

ELAINE

Yeah. See that-- 

PEGGY

(preoccupied) You know, it's amazing Peterman hasn't fired that dolt. She practically ran the company into the gro-ound. 

ELAINE

Well. Well, I thought she did a pretty good Job.. 

PEGGY

I heard she was a disaster, Suze-- 

ELAINE

(testy, leans into Peggy's personal space) Look-it. It's not Suze. All right? It's Su-zie. My name, is Su-zie! 

GEORGE

(on tape, singing) 'Believe it or not, George, isn't at home, please leave a mes-saaage at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up the pho-one. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not hooome.' (beep) 

JERRY

George, pick up. I know you're screening for Allison. 

GEORGE

(answers phone, good mood) Hey. 

JERRY

So, coffee shop? 

GEORGE

No, I can't. She knows I go there. It's not secure. (the call waiting beeps) Hey, I got another call comin' in. I gotta let the machine get it. Bye. (hangs up) 

GEORGE

(on tape, singing) 'Believe it or not, George, isn't at home, please leave a mes-saaage at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up the pho-one. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not hooome.' (beep) 

ALLISON

(on phone machine, peeved) George? Are you there? (muttering) I hate that stupid message. (terse) I know you're avoiding me, I'm at the office, please call me, I've gotta talk to you. (hangs up) 

GEORGE

(to phone) Hi, Allison? Oh, I guess you're not at home.. I probably should 'ave tried you at the office. Anyway, good to hear from ya, really looking forward to the ball.. (hangs up and happily chuckles) Ha ha! 

ELAINE

Can you believe this woman? 

JERRY

(ironic outrage) The nerve. Talkin' about ya behind your back--and right to your face! 

ELAINE

No. 'Suze!' I mean, 'Suzie!' 'Suzanne!' 'Suzanna.' Fine! But there is no, way, I'm gonna be a Suze. 

JERRY

No. No Suze. 

ELAINE

(tense) I mean--what am I--some pom-pom-wavin' Backseat Bimbo?! 

JERRY

Who are you describin'? 

ELAINE

Someone I know! 

JERRY

Named Suze? 

ELAINE

No, still Sharon! 

KRAMER

(comes in, subdued) Hey. (grabs a water from refrigerator) 

JERRY

Hey, I thought you went to the game. 

KRAMER

No. I was kicked out for fightin' with one of the players. (leaving) 

JERRY

Wait. Way--way--way--way--way--way--wait! Who?! 

KRAMER

(stops) W--Reggie Miller. 

ELAINE

Cheryl Miller's brother? 

KRAMER

Yeah. (leaving) 

JERRY

Hey--hey--hey--wait, wait, wait, wait! What happened! 

KRAMER

(stops again) Well, first of all, for some reason, they started the game an hour Late. And uh, I was sittin' next to Spike Lee an' he an' Reggie were jawin' at each other, so I guess I got involved. (leaving) 

ELAINE

(same time as Jerry) --Wait, whoa--whoa--whoa--whoa!-- 

JERRY

Well--wait--wait--wait--wait! What do you mean 'involved'?! 

KRAMER

(stops again) Well I.. ran out onto the court an' threw a hotdog at Reggie Miller. 'Involved.' An' they threw meee, an' Reggie, an' Spike out o' the game. 

ELAINE

So that's it? 

KRAMER

Well I, well I, felt, pretty bad about everything an' uh, then the three of us, we went to a strip club. (leaves) 

JERRY

Can you believe that? 

ELAINE

I didn't know Cheryl Miller's brother played basketball. 

KRAMER

(suddenly comes back, excited) The Knicks killed 'em a hundred an' ten to seventy three! 

JERRY

What--of course, without Reggie Miller, it's a blowout! 

KRAMER

No, Jerry--that's thirty-seven points! The Knicks covered! You won! See, that's a cooool-G, Daddy-O--now you gotta let it riiiide! 

JERRY

On what?! 

KRAMER

(real addict) Ah, come-on, Jerry--I don't wanna lose this feeling. Hey--let's go down to the O.T.B. We'll put some money on the ponies. (getting out pocket-watch) 

JERRY

Yeah, all right. 

KRAMER

(looking at watch) Ssssh--ah! They just closed! 

JERRY

(not) Oh. Too Bad. 

ELAINE

Mr. Peterman? You wanted to see me? 

PETERMAN

Apparently Peggy--down in Design?--got into a liiiittle bit of a Tiff yesterday with somebody named, 'Susie'? 

ELAINE

Su-sie? 

PETERMAN

Yes. Between you, me and the lamppost. And the desk. Peggy says this 'Suze' isn't much of a Worker. 

ELAINE

(nit) It's Susie. 

PETERMAN

Nevertheless, Elaine. The House, of Peterman is in Disorder. First thing tomorrow morning I want to see you, Peggy, and, Susie right here, in my office. 

ELAINE

(dismayed) Ah, all o'--all of us? 

KRAMER

Allison. Hi. Uh--listen: I'm really sorry about what happened at the game last night. Listen--could I have a ticket tonight--'cause the Rockets are in town an' that, Hakeem Olajuwon? Ohhh--he's got a real attitude. 

ALLISON

Kramer? Have you seen George, around? I can't get a hold of him. 

KRAMER

Oh, yeah, yeah. Well, he--uh--visits the guy across the hall from me like every ten minutes. 

ALLISON

Oh yeah? 

JERRY

(singing) Believe it or not, Geooorge isn't at home. 

MIKE

(comes up) Hey. Jerry. 

JERRY

Hey Mike.. How 'bout those Knicks? 

MIKE

(a little anxious) Yeah! How 'bout 'em? Ha ha. Look, Jerry. I can't pay you. 

JERRY

Why not? 

MIKE

'Cause I don't have the money.. 

JERRY

Mike. You say you're a bookie? You take a bet an' then you can't pay? I don't know, Mike, to me it sounds a little, how you say.. 'Phony'? 

MIKE

Just give me 'til Friday. Please. Please! 

JERRY

You know, you're supposed to be the Bookie. Act like one. 

MIKE

I'm sorry. Uh--oh here--let me give you a hand with that. 

JERRY

(trying to shut the trunk hood) Something wrong with this trunk. 

MIKE

Oh. Let me see. 

GEORGE

So--ah, Kramer. Why'd you ask me out to dinner? (amused) An' why Pomodoro? 

KRAMER

(quiet, delicately) Allison spoke to me, and um. She wanted me to speak to you. 

GEORGE

(quiet) Uh-oh. 

KRAMER

We all know that this relationship isn't working. So Allison an' I think that the best thing to do is just.. make a, clean break. 

GEORGE

Can't we discuss this? 

KRAMER

(reasoning) We just don't think you're ready for a serious relationship! 

GEORGE

(dismayed) I didn't even know you wanted to get serious! 

KRAMER

(dismayed) So what am I in this for? You know, I'm getting to a point in my life where I need something more than just.. a good time. (is tearing up) 

GEORGE

(pause) Are you? 

KRAMER

Wha--me? No! No. But she is. 

GEORGE

I, I can't believe this is happening! 

KRAMER

George, we're sorry. 

GEORGE

Krama. Please. 

KRAMER

(leaves, upset) Waaa-aa--aa! I'm sorry-- 

ELAINE

(entering, uneasy) Mr. Peterman, Peggy, I.. guess we, should just get this over with. (sits) 

PETERMAN

Just Hold On a minute. Still One Short. 

ELAINE

Oh. No, we're not-- 

PEGGY

Susie has been very rude to me. 

PETERMAN

Well, Elaine, has nothing but Good things to say about Susie. 

ELAINE

Look. (engaging smile) We don't have to name names, or, point fingers, or.. (breathes in) name names! (indicating empty chair) Me and her, have had our problems. She and I have had our problems! You and I, and she and you-- 

PETERMAN

Don't you drag me into this! This is between you and her, and her. (indicating empty chair) 

ELAINE

Yes! And I am convinced that if she were here with us today, she would agree with me, too. 

PETERMAN

Who. 

ELAINE

(uh-oh) Her? 

PETERMAN

Where is she?! 

ELAINE

Ah--this is part of the problem! 

PEGGY

Iiii thought I was, part of this problem. 

ELAINE

(smiling, convincing) You're a, huuge part of the problem. But, I think that at it's core, this is a Susie-and-Elaine problem that requires, a Susie-and-Elaine solution! And, who better to do that than.. Elaine and Susie! Susie and Elaine! 

PETERMAN

Well, now that we have that cleared up.. why don't the three of us have lunch. 

ELAINE

(feigning hearing something) What?! Oh! Oh, I'm, coming! I--I gotta go. (rushes out!) 

PETERMAN

She is The Best. What was your name again. 

KRAMER

Mike's outside. He wants to talk to you. 

JERRY

Well why doesn't he just come in? 

KRAMER

Because he's scared, Jerry. 

JERRY

Why is he scared. 

KRAMER

(sighs, opens door) Come on in. Did you do this? (Mike has two hand casts on) 

JERRY

Yeah, but-- 

KRAMER

Uh--ah--ah! You broke his thumbs. 

JERRY

It was an accident. 

KRAMER

Oh, is that what you call it when, Somebody doesn't Pay Up? 

MIKE

(desperate) I'll get you the money, Jerry. I got a hundred dollars in my front pocket if you want to, reach in an' take it! 

JERRY

(hands up) I don't want it that way. 

KRAMER

Nuh! Okay Jerry, how about if Mike fixes your truuunk, we call it even, an' this way, nobody has to get hurt. 

JERRY

(whatever) Fine.. 

MIKE

Oh--uh--thank you, Jerry, thank you! I won't forget this, I'm gonna fix your trunk good--real good! 

KRAMER

See that was nice, Jerry. (under breath) Oh, by the way, I'm the one who broke your trunk. 

JERRY

Ah, it's just a car. 

GEORGE

Hi. 

KRAMER

(looking down, nodding) Hi. 

GEORGE

It's, funny runnin' into you here. 

KRAMER

Yeah, yeah.. 

GEORGE

(embarrassed/self-conscious about his gut) Do I? Thanks.. You too.. 

KRAMER

Ooo, yeah.. (indicating his face, embarrassed) (Heh, right.) You know, it's gettin' kind of late, I, I really have to be going, so, uh, it's nice seeing you again, all right-- 

GEORGE

(sad) Yeah! Yeah. Hey--hey you, you know.. Maybe I'll call you sometime. 

KRAMER

George, it's over. It's just.. It's Over. (leaves) 

GEORGE

(pause) What do you think, Jerry. 

JERRY

(wistful) I don't know, I just see you guys together. 

MIKE

Thumbs! 

MIKE

(from inside the trunk) Oh! Help! Somebody, help! Help! 

JERRY

So Peterman bought it? I can't believe you got away with that! 

ELAINE

Well, I'm very fortunate to be surrounded by such stupidity. 

JERRY

Yeah, I know how you feel. 

ELAINE

Do you hear something? 

JERRY

What? 

JERRY

Oh, the trunk's broken, it's rattling. 

ELAINE

Jerry, I don't know how much longer I can keep this up. They're starting to give Susie assignments now! 

JERRY

Well, there's only one thing to do. Eliminate her. 

ELAINE

What? 

JERRY

(firmly matter-of-fact) Get Rid of Susie. Make her disappear. 

ELAINE

I kinda like her. 

JERRY

She's Gooone. 

ELAINE

Jerry-- 

JERRY

(impatient) Gone! (starts maniacally laughing) (briefly stops to point and explain) That bumper sticker. 

MIKE

(desperately anxious) Oh God, I'm in trouble.. 

GEORGE

Krama. Open up! I--I know you're in there! 

KRAMER

(opens door) Uh--George, uh--uh--it's five o'clock in the morning, what's the matter with you.. 

GEORGE

(sad) It's only four.. 

KRAMER

Huh? 

GEORGE

I--I've been, walkin' around all night.. I've been thinkin' about Allison and me.. an' you-- 

KRAMER

Oh. Oh, George. 

GEORGE

Please. Give me another chance. 

KRAMER

(regretfully) Uh.. I know I'm gonna regret this. (sigh) All right. 

GEORGE

(grateful, relieved) Thank you! I'm gonna make you both so happy! 

KRAMER

All right, all right, I'll see ya later. (shuts door) 

GEORGE

(delighted!) Woooo! 

PETERMAN

Elaine! Where's Susie? I want her to head up our new Fingerless Glove Division. 

ELAINE

(quiet) Oh, but I thought I was in line for that assignment. 

PETERMAN

Mmmmm--nah. 

ELAINE

All right, then, I was gonna wait, to tell ya this, but.. last night, Susie.. (difficult subject, quiet) she took her own Life.. 

KRAMER

(happy, enthused) We're takin' George back-- 

ALLISON

What?! 

KRAMER

He's gonna make us very happy. 

ELAINE

(quiet) Look at this turnout. 

JERRY

(quiet) Where did Susie find the time to meet all these people.. 

ELAINE

(irritated) Your funeral's not gonna come close to this. 

PEGGY

(to herself) Oh my god! (quiet) Susie? 

ELAINE

(quiet) Oh, oh--ho--I'm not Susie.. I'm Elaine. 

PEGGY

But I've been calling you Susie. 

ELAINE

Oh! Hadn't noticed! Excuse me. (she's going to the podium) 

PEGGY

I guess I never met Susie. 

JERRY

(privately amused) Suze? I actually had a little thing with her for a while. (indicating Elaine) Her too. 

ELAINE

What can you say about a girl like Susie? (she doesn't know..) 

KRAMER

Hey. 

GEORGE

Where's uh, where's Allison.. 

KRAMER

Oh, Allison, she didn't want to come. 

GEORGE

But you took me back. 

KRAMER

Well, yeah, I did, but she's a tough nut. How d'ya like the tuxedo. It's a rental but I've had it for fifteen years. All right, eh. (heading in) 

GEORGE

Where are you goin'.. 

KRAMER

The Ball, silly. 

GEORGE

(afraid not) No no, no no no. You're not goin' in there. 

KRAMER

George. I thought you were gonna Change. 

GEORGE

(impatient) For her. Not for you. 

KRAMER

(light admonishing, under breath) Let's just try, an' have a nice time for once, an' we'll talk about this when we get home.. 

GEORGE

All right, look--wait--wait--Krama--wait, wait a minute, you are not. You are not goin' in. Ah-ahhh! 

WILHELM

Wow! What an, Entrance! (friendly, to George) And eh, who might this be? 

KRAMER

Oh, I'm with him. 

WILHELM

Oh. Ah-ha.. 

ELAINE

And.. also, much like me, Susie hated going to the, Market. 

PETERMAN

Elaine! May I say a few words. 

ELAINE

Oh, god, yes, Mr. Peterman. (steps down) 

PETERMAN

(steps up to the podium, refreshed) Ahhh. I don't think I'll ever be able to forget Susie--ahhh. And most of all, I will never, forget that one night. Working late on the catalogue. Juuust the two of us. And we surrendered to temptation. And it was Pretty Good. 

JERRY

(proud to Peggy, under his breath) Yeah, but he didn't sleep with both of 'em. (winks) 

PETERMAN

But Iiii never heard her Cries for Help. (sighs) An' nowww.. Susie is gone. 

MIKE

(running in, still hoarse, desperate!) Hold on! Hol--on! Susie didn't commit suicide! (rushes up to podium!) She was Murdered, by Jerry, Sein-feld! 

JERRY

(smugly, under-his-breath) Not only that, I broke his thumbs. 

PETERMAN

Elaine? Guess what. I've decided to Form a Charitable Foundation, in Susie's honor. And as Susie's best friend, I want you to be involved. 

ELAINE

Mr. Peterman.. (leaning forward, whispering) I'm Susie.. She's me.. 

PETERMAN

(leans forward, whispers carefully) I feel the same way. (announcing) And that's why this foundation will meet around Your Schedule. Nights! Weekends! Every, Free Moment you have. (leaving, pats her shoulders confidently) 

ELAINE

(looks up, screaming in frustration!) Suuuuuuuuuuze! 

JENNA

Morning. 

JERRY

Morning. 

JENNA

Hope you don't mind baking soda flavour. 

JERRY

(applying paste to brush) Ah, baking soda. Annoying little product. 'I can do this. I can do that.' Why doesn't this stuff just shut up? 

JENNA

I'm gonna grab you a towel. 

JERRY

Ooh-ooh 

GEORGE

So? 

JERRY

So? She used the toothbrush! 

GEORGE

You said you grabbed it outta there real fast, right? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

GEORGE

So I'm sure whatever germs it landed on were knocked out, and by the time the rest of them realised what was going on, you had already grabbed it out. 

JERRY

How many years of med school did you have? 

GEORGE

Was she mad? 

GEORGE

You didn't tell her. 

JERRY

Jenna's like me. She's very... (searches for word) 

GEORGE

Finicky? Prissy? Fastidious? 

JERRY

I'll take fastidious. 

JERRY

What is that? 

GEORGE

Ahh, Steinbrenner gave 'em to us, in honour of Phil Rizzuto being inducted into the Hall of Fame. 

HEAD

Holy cow! 

JERRY

They don't actually have to squeeze his head to get him to say 'holy cow', do they? 

GEORGE

Just the last few innings of a double-header. 

KRAMER

Hey. Look at this. I'm in the passing lane of the Arthur Berkhardt expressway, going seventy and (makes impact sound - pckergh!) Dragged this thing for five exits. 

JERRY

Why didn't you pull over? 

KRAMER

Well I was draughting behind a semi. I didn't wanna lose him. The infrastructure, Jerry, it's crumbling. 

HEAD

Holy cow! 

KRAMER

Well, look at that. A talking Nixon. 

OWNER

China Panda. 

ELAINE

Yeah, I'd like to place an order. 

OWNER

Ah yes, what you like? 

ELAINE

This Supreme Flounder, it says first time served in America. Is that true? 

OWNER

What number? 

ELAINE

Forty-seven. 

OWNER

Yeah, first time. What else? 

ELAINE

Uh, that's it. 

OWNER

Address? 

ELAINE

Seventy-eight, West Eighty-sixth Street. Apartment three E. 

OWNER

That's southside. Sorry, we don't deliver below Eighty-sixth. 

ELAINE

I'm not below. 

OWNER

Yes you are. Street itself is boundary. 

ELAINE

Your guy can't cross to my side? 

OWNER

If we deliver to you, then what? Eighty-fifth Street, Wall Street, Mexico, Eighty-fourth Street. 

ELAINE

Alright, fine. I'll just cross and meet him. 

OWNER

Sorry, food only for those who live within boundary. (slams down phone) 

OWNER

(picks up phone) China Panda. 

ELAINE

(using silly voice) Uh, yeah yeah. I'd like to place an order. 

OWNER

Ah, what you like? 

KRAMER

Well, I'm a poppa. 

JERRY

Bring it on. Nothing's throwing me at this point. 

KRAMER

(handing Jerry a cigar) Well, as of today I am a proud parent of a one-mile stretch of the Arthur Berkhardt Expressway. 

JERRY

Oh, that adopt-a-highway thing. 

KRAMER

Yeah, I'm part of the solution now Jerry. Yeah, I went down there and I checked it out this morning. Here, take a look. Mile one-fourteen. 

JERRY

Aw, looks just like you. 

KRAMER

Aw, I'm beaming Jerry. 

JERRY

So what d'you have to do? Pay to keep it clean? 

KRAMER

They try to push you into using their cleaning crew, with all their so-called maintenance equipment. 

JERRY

That old scam. 

KRAMER

Yeah, well that's why I'm doing it all myself. This parenting isn't about delegating responsibility, it's about being there. 

JERRY

At the side of the road, with a pile of garbage. 

KRAMER

Quality time. 

GEORGE

Keys. I can't find my keys. 

JERRY

You lost Phil Rizzuto's head?! 

GEORGE

Have you seen 'em? 

JERRY

No. 

GEORGE

Dammit! 

KRAMER

C'mon, retrace your steps. What d'you do today? 

GEORGE

I got up, I was supposed to go to work, I came here instead. 

KRAMER

Right. 

JERRY

Well, they're not here. You'll have to dig up your spare set. 

GEORGE

I don't have a spare set. All my keys say 'do not duplicate'. 

JERRY

So? 

GEORGE

So you can't duplicate 'em. 

KRAMER

Sure you can. (to Jerry) Such a sweet kid. 

ELAINE

Oh. Oh, hi. China Panda? 

BOY

(suspicious) Why you waiting on the street and not in your apartment? 

ELAINE

I... thought that I would meet you halfway. 

BOY

You really live here? 

ELAINE

Oh yeah. (handing over money) There you go, keep the change. Bye now. I'll see you. 

ELAINE

(at the boy's back) This isn't fair. This is address discrimination! 

JERRY

Well, I cleaned out their whole dental hygiene shelf. 

GEORGE

So the plan is to secretly sterilise her mouth? 

JERRY

By the time I'm through with her mouth, she'll be able to eat off it. Is it safe to drink bleach if you dilute it? 

GEORGE

No, stings the throat. Anyway, so I was coming along here, and I felt like a piece of cake, you know? But then I thought, it's morning, I should really have a muffin. I like those chocolate chip ones. Then I figured, well, they're really both cake. So I, uh, I sat on that bench for a little while, twenty minutes or an hour, and then I figured, check and see what you were up to. (a thought occurs to him) Wait a minute, wait a minute. The broad jump! The broad jump over the pothole on Eighty-sixth Street! 

GEORGE

Now I remember, as I jumped over the hole I heard a, like a jingling sound. 

JERRY

You didn't look down? 

GEORGE

I was trying to stick the landing. (indistinct) ...was right around here. 

GEORGE

No! No!! 

HEAD

Holy, Holy Cow! 

JERRY

Poor son of a bitch. 

JERRY

It's a hundred thousand revolutions a second. It's the most powerful one they make. 

JENNA

It's like I'm holding a blender. 

JERRY

The engine's made by McDonnell-Douglas. 

JERRY

Oh no, you keep going. It shuts off automatically. 

JENNA

(restarting and reapplying the brush) Really, it does? 

JERRY

(unheard by Jenna) When the battery runs out. 

JENNA

(shouting to Jerry) I was really happy with my old toothbrush. 

JERRY

No, trust me, that one was doing more harm than good. Don't forget to use the Plax too. 

JENNA

That stuff tastes like bleach! 

JERRY

I don't know anything about that. 

JENNA

Mmm. My mouth feels so clean. 

JERRY

That's the idea. 

JERRY

You know, maybe we better not. I, I think I'm getting a little cold. I don't wanna give you any of my germs. 

JENNA

Aww. Okay. Thanks, I guess. 

ELAINE

You still couldn't kiss her? 

JERRY

She has a taint. I can't see it, but I know it's there. 

ELAINE

Oh, so now you're finding fault on a sub-atomic level. 

JERRY

Maybe if I could shrink myself down, like in Fantastic Voyage, and get inside a microscopic submarine, I could be sure. Although if there was something there, it might be pretty scary. Course, I would have that laser. 

ELAINE

Jer, do you see where this is going? 

JERRY

Being really clean and happy? 

ELAINE

Jerry, you have tendencies. They're always annoying, but they were just tendencies. But now, if you can't kiss this girl, I'm afraid we're talking disorder. 

JERRY

Disorder? 

ELAINE

And from disorder, you're a quirk or two away from full-on dementia. 

JERRY

(thoughtful) Hmm, that could hurt me. (pointing out of window) Hey, there it is. 

ELAINE

Shall we stop and say hi? 

JERRY

Nah, we've seen it. 

ELAINE

Yeah. 

KRAMER

(shouting after car) Hey Jerry! Yeah, I'll see you back at the house! 

KRAMER

Mile one-fourteen, clean as a whistle. 

MAN

Yeah? 

ELAINE

Hi. I'm your neighbour, uh, fr... from across the street. And uh, (coughs nervously) I was wondering, if it wouldn't be too much trouble, if I could use your apartment to order some food? 

MAN

Wha? What d'you want? 

ELAINE

You see, there's this certain flounder and they won't deliver it to my side of the street. 

MAN

Wh, when is that? 

ELAINE

No, I just need them to deliver it here and I have to be kinda inside is all. 

MAN

Who are you with? 

ELAINE

No, actually I'm... I'm just kind of hungry. 

MAN

Who let you in? 

ELAINE

Well, the lock was broken. You just have to jiggle it, actually. But, I just need like a half an hour to an hour. 

JERRY

What's with the signs? 

KRAMER

Hey, you should see the Berkhardt, Jerry. My mile is spotless. I mean the big stuff was easy. Cinderblocks, air-conditioners, shopping carts (makes sound - fzup!), I just rolled 'em into the woods. 

JERRY

Yeah, that stuff's all natural anyway. 

KRAMER

(holding up a sign) Speed limit, one hundred and sixty-five miles per hour. See? They slipped a one in there. (laughing) Those kids with the spray paint, God love 'em. 

JERRY

Hey. So, keys? 

GEORGE

No keys. And I been calling the city all day. Course there's not really a number to call if you wanna make a pothole. 

JERRY

I guess they leave that up to the general population. 

GEORGE

I tell you this. If the real Phil Rizzuto was down there, this wouldn't be happening! 

JERRY

Hard to say. 

KRAMER

Hey, you need some roadwork done? 'Cos I met some maintenance guys today on the highway, they could probably help you out. 

GEORGE

Really? 

KRAMER

Oh yeah, yeah. I borrowed some cones from them when I was sweeping my car-pool lane. 

JERRY

Yeah? 

JENNA

It's Jenna. 

JERRY

If you guys wouldn't mind, I would like to ward off dementia. 

GEORGE

You think you could hook me up with these guys? 

KRAMER

Oh yeah, yeah. Give me a ring tomorrow. I'm gonna be at emergency callbox seven-eight-four. 

GEORGE

Seven-eight-four. 

JENNA

Hey. 

JERRY

Hi. 

JENNA

How you feeling? 

JERRY

Good. My cold's gone, and I've been looking forwards to kissing you, which I'm ready to do now, if you are ready. 

JENNA

What?! 

JERRY

Nothing. I just, I uh, I bruised my lip. I was drinking a Celray, and I brought it up too fast and I banged it into my lip, (lower voice and hurriedly) and then I knocked your toothbrush into the toilet and I wasn't able to tell you before you could use it. 

JENNA

What? 

JERRY

I'm sorry. 

JENNA

When were you gonna tell me this?! 

JERRY

Obviously never. 

KRAMER

I need the yield sign. 

JERRY

Kramer, I'm kind of in the middle of something. Would you get these signs out of here, please? 

KRAMER

You could've introduced me. 

JERRY

I wouldn't know where to start. 

JERRY

(knocking) Hey, Jenna. Hey! 

JENNA

There. Now something of yours has been in the toilet. 

JERRY

What?! Wha... what'd you put in there? 

JENNA

Gotta run. 

JERRY

Oh, man! 

JERRY

(into phone) Hello, Jenna, did you dunk the spatula? Was it the spatula? Hello? Dammit! 

ELAINE

She won't even give you a hint? 

JERRY

No. Could be anything. The whole apartment's a biohazard. 

ELAINE

You know what I bet it is? (points) Your remote. 

JERRY

Yes, that is a definite possibility. 

ELAINE

(walking to the couch) Or, could be your walkman there. 

JERRY

Are you just screwing with me? 

ELAINE

Yeah, I am. 

KRAMER

Hey ah. 

JERRY

Hey, how's life on the road? 

KRAMER

Oh, I'm making a difference Jerry. 

JERRY

I don't doubt it. 

KRAMER

You should see the smiles on the drivers' faces. I mean, you gotta look quick, but they're there. 

JERRY

What's this? 

KRAMER

Well, you know, those annoying little bumps on the lane-lines? (makes noise - bum, bum, bum, bum, bump) 

JERRY

Isn't that some kind of safety thing? 

KRAMER

Well, I had to pull 'em up if I'm gonna widen the lanes. 

JERRY

What the hell are you talking about? 

KRAMER

Ah, you know how in planes they got first class? More leg room, better ride? Well, I'm bringing that concept to mile one-fourteen. 

ELAINE

How are you gonna widen the lanes? 

KRAMER

Well you black out lane-lines one and three, and a four-lane highway becomes a two-lane comfort cruise. (to Jerry) So, you got any black paint? 

JERRY

(sarcasm) Yeah, in my toolshed, next to the riding mower. 

ELAINE

(into phone) Yuh, I'd like an order of supreme flounder, number forty-seven. Yeah, apartment one-Q. 

JERRY

One-Q? Whose apartment is that? 

ELAINE

That's the janitor closet, across the street. 

JERRY

You're pretending to live in a janitor's closet, just to get this flounder? 

ELAINE

It's better than eating it alone in the restaurant, like some loser. 

KRAMER

That stuff is unbelievable. I'd eat it out of a dumpster. 

ELAINE

(heading to door) How do you know about it? You're not in the delivery zone. 

KRAMER

Well, Newman uses his mail truck to run fish for China Panda on the weekends. 

ELAINE

Well, mine's coming in ten, so... see you boys. 

KRAMER

Now, where's that tool shed of yours? 

ELAINE

Hi. Sorry, I didn't hear you. I was in the shower. 

ELAINE

I'll see you. 

RALPH

You Costanza? 

GEORGE

Yeah. Thanks for, thanks for coming by fellas. Eh, got a set of keys, buried in the pothole. 

RALPH

What're the keys doing in there? 

GEORGE

Just need to uh, to dig 'em up. 

RALPH

You put 'em in there? 

GEORGE

Nah, nah, it's uh, it's a long story. Just uh, try to get it up. 

RALPH

Bad place to put your keys. 

GEORGE

Yeah, I know that. (clears throat) Could you start, working? 

RALPH

Difficult job. You want those keys, we're gonna have to dig this up. 

GEORGE

(penny drops) Oh, uh, wait a minute, wait a minute. (snorts) Is this about money? 

RALPH

Yeah. (snorts) It's about money. 

ALLISTER

'Scuse me, what are you doing in there? 

ELAINE

Uhm, nothing. I was just uhm... I wasn't in there. 

ALLISTER

You were hanging around in there, lazing on the job. When you shoulda been downstairs in the basement, cleaning out those old carpets and scrap wood. 

ELAINE

Right, because... I'm the janitor. (picks teeth with fingernail) 

ALLISTER

Don't get smart with me. 

ELAINE

(meek) Yes ma'am. 

RADIO

Hey, and if you're heading north on the Arthur Berkhardt, whoah Nelly, for some reason four lanes are converging into two, instantaneously right at mile-marker one-fourteen. I don't know what that is, but the A-B's a parking lot out there. Somebody screwed up on that one. 

ELAINE

Oh it's you. 

JERRY

Is the flounder here yet? 

ELAINE

No, it's not here yet. You want the tour? 

ELAINE

(gesturing) There's this. 

JERRY

Nice. French doors'd really open this place up. Oh, but you have a slop-bucket. 

ELAINE

(gleeful) The fish! 

ELAINE

Ah, what're you doing here? 

GEORGE

Hey. 

JERRY

Hey. 

GEORGE

Oh, I was uh, I was waiting downstairs for the jackhammer, thought I'd drop by. 

JERRY

Kramer's guys? 

GEORGE

Yeah. I got 'em down to fifty bucks. I just have to do all the jackhammering myself. 

JERRY

Oh that's nice, kind of a hard-labour fantasy camp. 

GEORGE

Ow! 

ELAINE

Uh, man! 

KRAMER

Huh, yeah. (looks round) Oh, sweet setup. Elaine, d'you have any paint thinner? I need like uh, forty gallons. 

ELAINE

I'm plumb out. 

KRAMER

Oh man, if I don't get that black paint off the City's gonna go ape. I don't wanna lose my baby! 

ALLISTER

Janitor? 

ELAINE

(to the guys) Uh, Mrs Allister. (louder) Yeah, uh, just coming Mrs Allister. (to guys) Okay, I've gotta get out. 

ELAINE

Here, can you move, you gotta move from the door. 

ELAINE

Hi, I uhm... What can I do for you? 

ALLISTER

I told you yesterday to haul that trash outta the basement. 

ELAINE

Yeah, I am so sorry. 

ALLISTER

Some of the children have been playing near it and putting it in their mouths. 

ELAINE

Well, a lot of it is vegetable... 

ALLISTER

Get that stuff outta there today, or you'll be outta here. Understand? 

ELAINE

(meekly) Yes ma'am. 

GEORGE

...stop pushing. (to Elaine) Kramer spilled ammonia. 

JERRY

I don't feel like eating. 

KRAMER

(holding up a set of heavy chains) I'm gonna borrow this, huh? 

ELAINE

(to Mrs Allister) Janitor's meeting. 

JENNA

So Jerry, why'd you call me? 

JERRY

Well, I thought it's about time we put aside all this silliness. I know now you didn't put anything in my toilet bowl. (pause) Did you? 

JENNA

Yes, I did. 

JERRY

Well, whatever. So, how've you been? 

JENNA

Good. 

JERRY

Good. (pause) Steak knife? 

JENNA

Just eating away at you isn't it? 

JERRY

Nah. 

ELAINE

Hi. 

JENNA

Hi. 

JERRY

Hi. 

ELAINE

Hi. Jerry, can I borrow your car? 

JERRY

For what? 

ELAINE

I have to haul some dirty garbage to the dump. 

JERRY

Dirt? That's alright, (for Jenna's benefit) because there's nothing wrong with dirt. 

ELAINE

Well, actually it's pretty grimy. 

JERRY

Grime, grease, filth, funk, ooze. Whatever it is, you take that stuff and put it right on my leather upholstery. 

ELAINE

Well, I don't know who you are, but thanks for the car. 

JERRY

Sure. Bye. 

ELAINE

Bye. 

JENNA

Bye. 

ELAINE

Bye. 

JERRY

There, you see? I just leant her my car, and she's gonna fill it with all sorts of... (he cracks) Alright! You win! That car was my last germ-free sanctuary. I slept there last night! Now, for the love of God, please, what is it? What is it?! 

JENNA

Toilet brush. 

JERRY

Toilet brush, oh (he pulls a 'Damn, shoulda guessed!' face). Alright, I can replace that. 

JENNA

You wanna order dinner? 

JERRY

Yeah. Let's uh, go to your place. Because I, threw out all my dishes. 

JERRY

That's true. 

JENNA

Mm. 

JERRY

But, I'll tell you this much. I am never going to let some silly hygienic mishap get in the way of, what could be, a meaningful, long-lasting relationship. 

JENNA

Do you hear something? 

JERRY

I don't know what that could be. 

HEAD

Holy cow! 

JERRY

Anyway, I'm a new man, and I'm looking towards the future. Clean, dirty, whatever. 

JERRY

Holy cow! Have a nice life. 

ELAINE

Hey, look at this. Wide lanes. This is so luxurious. Woo, yeah. 

KRAMER

Bugger! 

NEWMAN

(sings) You're once. Twice. Three times a lady. 

NEWMAN

What the hell was that? 

KRAMER

Double bugger! 

NEWMAN

(sings) Yes, you're once. Twice. Three times... 

NEWMAN

Aaah! Aaagh! Aah-aah. Oh, oh the humanity! Aaagh! 

KRAMER

Hey buddy. What're you doing out here? 

KRAMER

Man, did you see that fireball? Woo-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo. 

KRAMER

Hey, I gotta skedaddle. You wanna lift? 

KRAMER

Newman! Newman!! 

KRAMER

Well, I'll meet you at the coffee shop. 

JERRY

You know at the movies, they show that little ad for the concession stand? 

ELAINE

Where the cartoon candy's dancing and the Milk Dud's playing the banjo? 

JERRY

He's wailing on that banjo. 

ELAINE

Yeah. 

JERRY

I just don't understand the raisinettes. 

ELAINE

The sax player? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

ELAINE

Yeah. 

JERRY

The box of raisinettes runs up to the concession stand, buys another box of raisinettes. 

ELAINE

So? 

JERRY

Box of raisinettes eating another box of raisinettes? It's perverse. 

ELAINE

HE's not gonna eat them. He's buying 'em for his Pepsi girlfriend. 

JERRY

Why's he dating a Pepsi? They're not having children. 

ELAINE

He's a musician. 

JERRY

Musicians. Get a real job. 

WAITRESS

What d'you want? 

GEORGE

Ah, I've had everything on the menu. Uh, surprise me. 

DANIELLE

(to George) Neil. 

DANIELLE

Neil. 

DANIELLE

(apologetic) Oh, I am sorry. (smiling broadly) I'm supposed to meet my boyfriend here. He looks just like you. 

GEORGE

(bemused) Really? 

DANIELLE

(smiling) Yeah. 

GEORGE

(pointing to himself) Like me? 

DANIELLE

Uh-huh. Sorry. 

GEORGE

(confused, to himself) Like me? But how? 

WAITRESS

Here's your halibut omelette. Surprised? 

GEORGE

Yes, yes, I am. 

KRAMER

Look what I got for you, for your Florida trip. Crazy Shirts was closing 'em out. I got a dozen for a buck. 

KRAMER

Saved a fortune. Look at that. Heyy. 

JERRY

(reading, unimpressed) Ohh, 'Number 1 Dad'. 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

JERRY

(examining the label) Ooh, and it's in medium. Perfect. 

KRAMER

Hey. 

GEORGE

Hey. 

JERRY

Hey. 

GEORGE

Hey. You ready? 

JERRY

Almost. 

KRAMER

Okay, look, uh, when you're in Florida, can my cigar guy drop off some Cubans for me at your parents' house? 

JERRY

(reluctant) Kramer, I'm helping my parents move into their new condo. I'm gonna be busy. 

KRAMER

Aw, c'mon man. Help a brother out. 

JERRY

(grudging) Alright. 

KRAMER

Yeahh. I owe you one. 

JERRY

(holding up the '# DAD' shirt) We're even. 

GEORGE

Jerry, figure this out. I'm in the coffee shop, and this beautiful girl I could never even talk to, mistakes me for her boyfriend. 

JERRY

(continuing to pack) That's a nice four seconds. 

GEORGE

(incredulous) I look just like him. I. Me. (flings his arms out) This! This is what her boyfriend looks like. How is that possible? 

JERRY

Maybe he has money. 

GEORGE

(wondering) Maybe he doesn't. Maybe he and I are exactly the same, except for one minor, yet crucial, detail. You never know. 

JERRY

(zipping up his bag) Sometimes you do. 

GEORGE

Maybe it's some small thing I could change. Like a moustache. Or wearing a top hat, or a monocle, or a..or a cane. 

JERRY

(picking up his bag and coat) Who's she dating? Mr Peanut? 

GEORGE

(pointedly) She could do a lot worse than Mr Peanut, my friend. 

BLAINE

So, what d'you wanna see? 

ELAINE

(indicating a movie poster) What about Sack Lunch? 

BLAINE

(indicating another poster) How about The English Patient? It's up for all those Oscars. 

ELAINE

Oh, c'mon Blaine. I mean, look at the poster for Sack Lunch. 

BLAINE

It's a family in a brown paper bag. 

ELAINE

(laughing) Don't you wanna know how they got in there? 

BLAINE

No. 

ELAINE

(disappointment) Aww. Sold out. 

BLAINE

(to the booth guy) Oh, two for The English Patient. 

ELAINE

So d'you think they got shrunk down, or is it just a giant sack? 

GEORGE

(smiling) Uh, hi. Uhm, remember me? I..I'm the guy who looks like Neil? 

DANIELLE

(smiling back) Hi. 

GEORGE

Huh-Hi. (looks around a little) Uhm, is Neil here? 

DANIELLE

Oh, no. He got held up at work. 

GEORGE

Oh, that's too bad. I kinda wanted to meet him, seeing as how we look so similar. 

DANIELLE

Well, you know, you don't look that much like him. 

GEORGE

(disappointment) Oh. Course not. 

DANIELLE

No, you're a little taller. 

DANIELLE

You look like you're in better shape than Neil. Do you work out? 

GEORGE

(smiling) Listen, I..I..I don't mean to seem forward... 

GEORGE

...but is there any way that I could possibly have Neil's phone number? 

ELAINE

(very dissatisfied) Why is everyone talking about 'The English Patient, it's so romantic'. (vehement) God, that movie stunk! 

BLAINE

I kinda liked it. 

ELAINE

(firm) No you didn't. 

CAROL

Elaine. Elaine, did you just see The English Patient? 

GAIL

(tearful) Didn't you love it? 

LISA

How could you not love that movie? 

ELAINE

How about, it sucked? 

CAROL

That Ralph Fiennes, I would give up my firstborn for him. 

ELAINE

(aside) Huhh, getting the short end of that stick. 

MORTY

Jerry, this is Del Boca Vista's new physical fitness room. They got medicine balls, you can bike ride, anything you want. 

JERRY

Stairmaster? 

MORTY

What? 

JERRY

Nothin'. 

MORTY

(opening his tracksuit top) See what I'm wearing? 

JERRY

Oh, did you get that outta my bag? 

MORTY

No, your mother found it. Son, this is the most wonderful and thoughtful thing you've ever done for me. 

JERRY

You know, I bought you a Cadillac. Twice. 

MORTY

Hoh, here he is. This is the man I wanted you to see. Izzy Mandelbaum. He's eighty years old, but strong as an ox. (pointing) Watch this. 

MORTY

See that? You couldn't do that. 

JERRY

I could, but I choose not to. 

SID

Hey Morty. (nodding toward Jerry) Who's this? 

MORTY

This is my son Jerry, from New York. (leaning toward Sid) He thinks he can lift more than Izzy. 

JERRY

(protesting) I..I didn't say that. 

SID

(calling over) Hey, Izzy, this kid says he can lift more than you can. 

IZZY

Your kid's pretty funny, Morty. Should be a comedian. 

JERRY

(smiles) Actually, I am a comedian. 

SID

That's not so funny. 

IZZY

(challenging) Think you're better than me, huh? 

MORTY

Izzy used to work out with Charles Atlas in the fifties. 

JERRY

(jocular) Eighteen-fifties? 

IZZY

Yeah, that's it. It's go time. (points to the weights he put down) Let's see you lift that. 

JERRY

(reluctant) Mr Mandelbaum, I... 

IZZY

C'mon, c'mon. Pump it! 

JERRY

(consenting) Alright. 

IZZY

Yeah, wrong attitude. you're not bringing that trash into my house. 

JERRY

There. Alright? 

IZZY

Step aside, stringbean. 

IZZY

I'll show you. We're gonna take it up a notch. 

IZZY

(agonised) Ah! My back. Ugh. 

IZZY

(drawn out) Aaaahh. 

SID

Somebody, call an ambulance. 

MORTY

(unpanicked) There's already an ambulance here for Mrs Glickman. There's room for one more. 

ELAINE

(handing over her money) Okay, one for Sack Lunch. (taking the ticket) It's good, right? (smiling) Yeah, good. 

ELAINE

(surprise) Hey, what're you guys doing here? 

LISA

We just saw The English Patient again. 

GAIL

It's even better the second time. 

ELAINE

They make it longer? 

BLAINE

(to the girls) Got my umbrella. 

ELAINE

(shocked) Blaine!? 

BLAINE

Elaine. 

ELAINE

I thought you were busy tonight. 

BLAINE

(cold) Well, to tell you the truth Elaine. I don't know if I can be with someone who doesn't like The English Patient. 

ELAINE

It's just a stupid movie. 

BLAINE

(to Carol) That's what I'm talking about. 

CAROL

(taking Blaine's arm) Come on, Blaine. Let's go. 

BLAINE

(bitter) Enjoy Sack Lunch! 

ELAINE

(fierce) I will! 

HELEN

(accusing) How could you do that to Mr Mandelbaum? You should be ashamed of yourself. 

JERRY

(defensive) He egged me on. 

HELEN

You should be more mature. 

JERRY

He's eighty! 

MORTY

(standing) Okay. Tomorrow, Jerry and I will visit Izzy and apologise. Now, goodnight. 

HELEN

(walking after Morty) You're not sleeping in that shirt. It's too tight. 

MORTY

This shirt will never leave my body. 

HELEN

(to Jerry) Goodnight. 

JERRY

(smiling) Alright. Seven-thirty, got the place to myself. 

GUILLERMO

Jerry Seinfeld please. 

JERRY

Ah, you must be Kramer's guys. (indicating) Come on in. You got the cigars? 

GUILLERMO

What cigars? 

JERRY

Kramer said I was supposed to bring him back some Cubans. 

GUILLERMO

(indicating the threesome) We are the Cubans. 

KRAMER

Yeah, hello, Jerry's place. 

JERRY

(animated) They're real Cubans?! They're human beings, from Cuba?! 

KRAMER

I said Cubans. What'd you think I meant? 

JERRY

Cigars! 

KRAMER

Jerry, Cuban cigars are illegal in this country. That's why I got these guys. 

JERRY

(incredulous) You're making your own cigars now? 

KRAMER

Yeah, yeah. I got investors all lined up. 

JERRY

(to Kramer) Hold on a second. (to Morty) Hiya dad. 

MORTY

(without looking up) Who are they? 

JERRY

They're Cuban cigar rollers. 

MORTY

(walking back out of the room) Don't tell your mother. 

JERRY

What is that bubbling sound? Are you making your tomato sauce? 

KRAMER

Hot and spicy. 

JERRY

(accusing) You're not wearing a shirt, are you? 

KRAMER

Yes I am. 

JERRY

What colour is it? 

KRAMER

Damn! 

GEORGE

You know, you could've just given me Neil's number. You..you didn't have to take me out to dinner. 

DANIELLE

I wanted to give it to you in person. 

DANIELLE

(flirtatious) You know, I don't have to be up in the morning, and I know a great breakfast place, right around the corner. 

GEORGE

Does Neil like to eat a big breakfast? 

DANIELLE

(inviting) Why don't you come in? We'll take about it. 

GEORGE

(looking at his watch) I really should get going. Y'know, I..I wanna be home in case Neil calls. 

DANIELLE

Well, goodnight. 

GEORGE

(hurried) I'll see you. 

WAITRESS

Rough night? 

ELAINE

Ugh. You wouldn't believe it. My boyfriend dumped me. My friends, who I don't even like, they won't talk to me. (face-pulling) All because I don't like that stupid English Patient movie. 

WAITRESS

Really? I thought it was pretty good. 

ELAINE

Oh, come on. Good? What was good about it? (scoffs) Those sex scenes! I mean, please! Gimme something I can use! 

WAITRESS

(sour) Well, I liked it. 

ELAINE

(calling after) Hey. You forgot about my piece of pie. Hello? (irritated) You know, sex in a tub. That doesn't work! 

JERRY

This is quite a condo. 

MORTY

The Mandelbaums own the Magic Pan restaurants. 

JERRY

The crepe place? 

MORTY

Yeah. This is all big crepe money. 

JERRY

(doubtful) There's crepe money? 

IZZY

What are you doing here? 

JERRY

(apologetic) Aw, Mr Mandelbaum, I just wanted to come by and tell you how sorry I was that you hurt yourself. 

IZZY

What the hell is that? 

JERRY

What? 

IZZY

That shirt. You think that you are the number one dad? 

MORTY

This was a gift from my son. 

IZZY

Oh, I see how it works now. (indicates Jerry) He knocks me outta commission, so (indicates Morty) you can strut around in your fancy number one shirt. (moves the bedcovers) Well, I'll show you who's number one. 

JERRY

Mr Mandelbaum, please. 

IZZY

It's go time. 

IZZY

(pained) Ahh. My back. I can't move. 

MORTY

Call an ambulance. 

JERRY

I think I saw one a coupla doors down. 

JERRY

(disbelief) So she wanted you to come up, but you left because you thought some guy might be calling you?! 

GEORGE

(animated) Some guy. Some guy? Neil! I have got to find out how he could get a girl like Danielle. 

JERRY

(pointing out the obvious) George, you've got Danielle. Forget about Neil. You've out-Neiled him. 

GEORGE

(surprised) So, I'm Neil? How did I do that? 

JERRY

I don't know, but you better keep it up. 

GEORGE

I'm gonna go meet Danielle. (grabs his coat) There's a new Neil in town! (triumphant laughter) Hahaha! 

JERRY

(to himself) I try to take a vacation, I come back, the whole operation's a shambles. (answers phone) Hello. 

MORTY

Hey Jerry. Number One here. Did you go see Izzy at the back specialist? 

JERRY

I will, I just walked in the door. 

HELEN

You have to go see him. 

JERRY

Ma. 

MORTY

Helen, will you stop bothering him. 

HELEN

Jerry, that shirt is gone right to his head. 

MORTY

Number One, signing off. 

KRAMER

Jerry, I just picked up the Cubans at the bus station. (shrill) What's going on!? 

JERRY

What? 

KRAMER

(animated) They're not real Cubans. They're Dominicans. 

JERRY

So? 

KRAMER

So, Jerry, if my investors don't get Cubans, the whole deal's off. 

JERRY

What's the difference? 

KRAMER

Jerry, once you've had real Cubans, there's just nothing else like it. 

JERRY

(confused) We're talking about people, right? 

KRAMER

Yes, yes. The quality, the texture, the intoxicating aroma. These guys don't have it. 

JERRY

I thought they smelled pretty nice. 

KRAMER

Jerry, your palate's unrefined. 

JERRY

Is not. 

KRAMER

Is too. 

JERRY

Is not. 

KRAMER

Is too. 

JERRY

I'm not having this conversation. 

KRAMER

Are too. 

JERRY

Am not. 

KRAMER

Are too. 

JERRY

Am not. 

KRAMER

Are too. 

PETERMAN

Another productive meeting. By the way, I saw that English Patient film last night. It was extraordinary. 

DUGAN

(enthusiastic) Oh yes. It was so romantic. It ravished me. 

PETERMAN

Elaine, what'd you think? 

ELAINE

(hesitant) Well, uh, act..actually, I haven't seen it. So, I couldn't tell you whether I liked it, or whether it really sucked. 

PETERMAN

(aghast) You haven't seen it? 

ELAINE

(shakes head) No. 

PETERMAN

That's it! Drop everything. We're going right now. 

JERRY

Again, Mr Mandelbaum, this back specialist is supposed to be the best. So if there's anything else I can do, please don't hesitate to, uh, try and find my number. 

IZZY

Uh, oh, wait. 

IZZY

How 'bout that, huh? The World's Greatest Dad. My son made it for me. 

JERRY

(humouring him) That's very nice. 

IZZY

The best in the world. (pointing to himself) Which means I'm better than just number one. 

JERRY

Well, I don't know how official any of these rankings really are. 

IZZY

Hi, son. 

JERRY

(surprise) This is your son? 

IZZY

I got married in high school. 

IZZY

This is Seinfeld's kid. 

JERRY

(jocular) You got any kids? 

JERRY

(trying to defuse the situation) Look, no-one is lifting anything. 

IZZY

(pointing) The television. 

JERRY

(under his breath) Oh no. 

IZZY

(urgent) Call an ambulance. 

JERRY

(laconic) We're already in a hospital. 

HAFFLER

Awright, partner. Let's get down to business. 

KRAMER

(nervous) Okay, well, uh, I'll uh, I'll get the Cubans. 

KRAMER

They're right out here. 

KRAMER

Hey, here they are. The Cubans. Real Cubans. 

HAFFLER

You wouldn't be trying to sell old Earl Haffler Dominicans in a Cuban wrapper now, would you? 

KRAMER

(fidgety) Oh, now, come on. Look at these boys. If they were any more Cuban, Castro would've smoked them himself. Huh. 

HAFFLER

(confusion) We're talking about people, right? 

KRAMER

(puzzled) I think so. 

HAFFLER

I thought he quit smoking cigars. 

KRAMER

Well, yeah, yeah. But they also rolled for his brother... (thinks for a second) ...Dennis. 

HAFFLER

(dubious) Dennis Castro? 

KRAMER

Uh, Dwayne. 

HAFFLER

Get the hell outta my office. 

KRAMER

(shrill) What!? 

DANIELLE

You know, Neil called me today. 

GEORGE

(interested) Really? 

DANIELLE

Yeah. He's pretty upset that I broke up with him to go out with you. 

GEORGE

(smug) Ah, I guess I showed Neil who's Neil. 

DANIELLE

He wants to get together tomorrow night and have coffee. 

GEORGE

(little worried) Coffee? (thinks) I can beat that. Move in with me. 

DANIELLE

(surprised) What? 

GEORGE

(smiles) Beats the hell out of coffee. 

PETERMAN

(emotional) And I thought I knew what love was. 

ELAINE

(indifferent) Yuh. 

JERRY

(incredulous) You asked her to move in with you? 

GEORGE

I gotta stay one step ahead of Neil. 

JERRY

(musing) What if it's Neil Armstrong? 

GEORGE

(animated) Then I'm going to Mars! 

JERRY

What if it's Neil Diamond? 

GEORGE

(tormented) Aw, shut up Jerry! Just shut up! 

JERRY

Alright, I gotta go back to the hospital. 

GEORGE

What, to see the old guy? 

JERRY

No, I got into a thing with the son, and now he's laid up too. 

GEORGE

How old's the son? 

JERRY

I think he's the same age as the father. 

GEORGE

What is with this family? 

JERRY

I dunno. It's like, if one of 'em dies, the other one wants to bench press the casket. 

KRAMER

(quietly) Hey, Jerry. 

KRAMER

(noise - like shivery) Datiditadit. 

JERRY

You're cold? 

KRAMER

No. (indicates with his head) (noise again) Ditadidatidat. 

JERRY

Something wrong with your chest? 

KRAMER

(indicating with his thumb) Dijadidatjd. There. 

JERRY

(leaning round Kramer) Where? 

KRAMER

(urgent) No, no. Don't look. Don't look. 

KRAMER

Over there. The Dominicans. 

JERRY

Aren't they supposed to be rolling cigars? 

KRAMER

Well, it didn't quite work out, and now I've got nothing for them to do. 

GEORGE

So? 

KRAMER

So, I taught 'em all about Cuba, and they really took to it. You know, Marxism, the Worker's Revolution, the clothing. 

JERRY

Boy, they seem pretty angry about something. 

KRAMER

(nervous) Yeah. I'm a little worried. When there's no work, and the people get restless, who do you think they come after? (pointing to himself, shrill) El Presidente! 

JERRY

I swear to you, I didn't know they TV was bolted to the table. 

JERRY

He couldn't handle the weight. 

IZZY

(hostile) Oh, so now you think you're better than me? 

JERRY

(placatory) Look, let me just state for the record, I think you're both better than me. 

IZZY

Okay. 

IZZY

My dad. 

JERRY

(incredulous) Oh, come on! 

JERRY

He was trying to lift the TV. 

JERRY

(consternation) Oh no. (to the bedridden two) It's go time. 

IZZY

I still thought you could do it. 

JERRY

Fellas, fellas, look, I gotta go. 

IZZY

Oh yeah, that's right. Go. Put us all in the hospital. And you've ruined our business with all your macho head games. 

JERRY

(defensive) I didn't ruin your business. 

IZZY

Yes, you did. There's nobody there now at the Magic Pan to roll the crepes. We gotta close it up. 

JERRY

(uncertain) Don't you hire people to do that? 

IZZY

Each crepe has to be hand-rolled by a Mandelbaum. That's what puts the magic in Magic Pan! 

JERRY

(thinking) So, you just need some guys that could roll 'em? 

IZZY

Yeah. 

JERRY

(having an idea) I think I can help you out. I'll see you later. 

JERRY

Here. 

IZZY

You think you're better than us, don't you?! Huh!? 

PETERMAN

Elaine, I hope you're watching the clothes, because I can't take my eyes off the passion. 

ELAINE

(quiet vehemence) Oh. No. I can't do this any more. I can't. It's too long. (to the screen) Quit telling your stupid story, about the stupid desert, and just die already! (louder) Die!! 

PETERMAN

(surprised) Elaine. You don't like the movie? 

ELAINE

(shouts) I hate it!! 

CROWD

Shh! 

ELAINE

(shouts) Oh, go to hell!! 

PETERMAN

(quietly) Well, why didn't you say so in the first place? You're fired. 

ELAINE

(grabbing her bag and coat) Great. I'll wait for you outside. 

JERRY

He was gonna fire you? 

ELAINE

The only way I could talk him out of it was that I agreed to go and visit the Tunisian desert. 

JERRY

Tunisia? 

ELAINE

That's where they filmed the movie. It's supposed to inspire me. 

JERRY

Well, that doesn't sound so bad. 

ELAINE

I have to live in a cave. 

JERRY

(sardonic) Oh. (smiles) 

KRAMER

These Dominicans really know their way round a crepe. Look at that. It's like they're rolling a double corona. 

KRAMER

(to one of the guys) Just a cigar made outta bisquik, huh, Guillermo? 

DANIELLE

I'm very happy with George. I'm sorry Neil, it's over. 

DANIELLE

Come on, let's just eat our crepes. 

CUSTOMER

(pained scream) Aaghh!! My face! 

DANIELLE

(concerned cry) Neil! 

JERRY

Why are the crepes spraying? 

KRAMER

(looks over at the three guys) The Dominicans are rolling them too tight. (regretful) Uhm, well, that's why you gotta get real Cubans. 

GEORGE

Danielle. Where's Neil? (indicating the bed) Is this him? 

DANIELLE

Yeah, that blueberry crepe burned him pretty badly. 

GEORGE

(to Danielle) Whose cane is this? 

DANIELLE

It's Neil's. 

GEORGE

(to himself) A cane. I knew it. (to Neil) So, we meet at last. I admire your skills, Mr Peanut. 

GEORGE

Well, Danielle, (digs in his pocket) we should get going. I got a key made for you. 

DANIELLE

George, I can't move in with you. 

GEORGE

(shocked) What? 

DANIELLE

I'm sorry, but I'm taking Neil to a clinic in England. 

GEORGE

(animated) N..no, no. You can't leave me. (frantic) Marry me! I'll burn myself. I'll burn my parents! 

DANIELLE

Sorry George. 

NEIL

(beckoning) George. 

NEIL

(quiet triumph) I win. 

TAN

Ladies and gentlemen. In just one moment, we'll be showing our feature presentation... 

ELAINE

(dread) No, no, no, no, no. 

TAN

...the comedy hit, Sack Lunch, starring Dabney Coleman. 

ELAINE

(cheering up) Ah, right! Aw, this is shaping up. 

GUY

Excuse me, please. 

ELAINE

Oh, sure. 

ELAINE

(uncomfortable) Ooh. 

GUILLERMO

Ladies and gentlemen. Because we have been exploited by your Magic Pan crepe restaurants... 

GUILLERMO

...we are hijacking this plane to Cuba! 

GUILLERMO

Everyone stay in your seats. And shut that movie off! 

ELAINE

(annoyed) Aww, nuts! 

GEORGE

Oh, boy I was up to four in the morning watching the Omen trilogy. 

JERRY

That's good stuff. 

GEORGE

I can't to myself. I'm exhausted. 

JERRY

Can you grab a nap at work. 

GEORGE

Not with that big glass window looking out into the hall. I'd love a good nap. That's the only thing getting me out of bed in the morning. I'll see ya'. 

ELAINE

Bye. 

JERRY

So what are you doing now? 

ELAINE

I'm going to take a little stroll through the park. 

JERRY

With a gentleman caller? 

ELAINE

Yes, his name is Hal. 

JERRY

The walking date is a good date. You don't have to look right at the other -person. 

ELAINE

It's the next best thing to being alone. 

JERRY

Shower? 

KRAMER

No, pool. I just swam 200 laps. 

ELAINE

You are kidding. 

KRAMER

Look at hose babies [hands]. They're prunes. I saw Conrad going up to oyur place. 

ELAINE

Oh, yeah, that's right. Those new kitchen cabinets. How is that coming? 

JERRY

A little slow. I've got to hold this guy's hand on every little decision. 

ELAINE

Hey, Kramer, listen, you've seen the Omen right? 

ELAINE

What exactly was that kid? 

KRAMER

Who, Damien? Nothing, just a mischievous, rambunctious kid. 

WILHELM

Oh, George, have you seen the American league directory? It is a big green book. Oh, thanks kiddo. 

ELAINE

Well I don't care. It was delicious. 

ELAINE

Wanna sit down? 

HAL

Oh, I don't sit on park benches. They're very bad for the back. 

ELAINE

Really? 

HAL

I threw my back out about 15 years ago. Ever since I have been very careful. I only buy furniture in the ergonomics store. 

ELAINE

Oh those places have the stupidest names. Like, uh, 'Back in ', or 'Good Vertibrations'. 

HAL

Not this one. It's called the 'Lumbar Yard'. 

CONRAD

Oh, Jerry are you okay with this hinge? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

CONRAD

I can get you any kind you want, you know. Four holes, three holes, two holes, bronze, no hinge at all. 

JERRY

You know, why don't we just go with the one in your hand? 

CONRAD

Oh, these are different. 

JERRY

Drop one. . . . left! 

GEORGE

Jerry, look at my eyes. 

JERRY

A little less beady today. 

GEORGE

Because I'm REFRESHED. I finally found a way to sleep in my office. Under the desk. I lie on my back. I tuck in the chair. I'm invisible. 

JERRY

Sounds like a really cool fort. 

CONRAD

Jerry, do you want a flat edge on this molding or do you want me to bevel it? 

JERRY

I'll tell you what I would like you to do with it. 

GEORGE

Conrad, is it? 

CONRAD

Conrad, Connie, or Con, whatever you prefer. 

GEORGE

Uh, let me ask you a question. Could you, uh, expand the space underneath a desk to give it a little more headroom? 

JERRY

He's kind of tied up here. 

GEORGE

It'll have to be a night job anyway. You don't normally work after dinner, do you? 

CONRAD

There is no normal, whatever jerry wants. He wants me here late, I'm here late, he wants me here early, I'm here early, he . . . 

JERRY

Why don't you just work on George's project for a while? 

CONRAD

Whatever you want. 

JERRY

So how was Wednesday's walk in the park with Hal. 

ELAINE

Uh, it was okay,. He's coming over later to watch a movie. Hey listen, what's better for your back? Couch cushions or a folding chair? 

JERRY

I don't know. 

ELAINE

Uh, maybe we'll just stand and watch the tv. [knock knock]. I gotta go someone's at my door. Yeah! 

GUY

Delivery. Elaine Benes? 

ELAINE

Yeah. 

GUY

We're from the Lumbar Yard, we got your mattress. 

ELAINE

Mattress, I didn't order a mattress. Who sent this? Hal Kitzmiller? 

GEORGE

Do you think it might be possible to add a little shelf like, uh, for an alarm clock? 

CONRAD

You mean like that big? 

GEORGE

Like this. 

CONRAD

Yeah, I can do that. 

GEORGE

Thanks. You know this could sound crazy but, what do you think about adding a drawer for - like a blanket? 

CONRAD

Blanket or quilt? 

GEORGE

Blanket. 

CONRAD

That thick? 

GEORGE

Maybe like this. 

CONRAD

Like that? 

GEORGE

Yeah, like that. 

CONRAD

If that is what you want. 

GEORGE

That is what I want. 

CONRAD

Hey George, you want this cup holder mounted on the left, or the right, or the middle, . . . 

GEORGE

Whatever!!. . . . Oh oh oh this is unbelievable. This is better than my bed at home. 

GEORGE

Its been a long night. You go home and get some sleep. 

CONRAD

If that's what you want. 

GEORGE

That's what I want. 

WILHELM

Morning George. 

GEORGE

Good morning Mr. Wilhelm. 

KRAMER

got problems Jerry. 

JERRY

What happened? 

KRAMER

Well I had been swimming for three hours and I was in a real grove so I decided to keep going. But at ten they start the aquasonics Thirty-five geriatrics throwing elbows. It was like I was swimming through a flabby armed spanking machine. 

JERRY

How long did that last? 

KRAMER

A half hour then diving class started. Well... that got a little messy. I gotta find a new place to swim 'cause that pooll can't hold me, Jerry. 

JERRY

How was the movie? 

ELAINE

I cancelled. Hal sent a mattress to my apartment. The nerve of that guy. 

JERRY

Why? 

ELAINE

He's got a back problem. 

JERRY

So you think he was expecting a roll in the supportive hay. 

ELAINE

After one date! 

KRAMER

What's that guy's last name again? 

ELAINE

Kitzmiller. 

KRAMER

Oh, that's right. 

JERRY

So what are you going to do with the mattress? 

ELAINE

I don't know. Chuck it? 

KRAMER

Oh, no no no no I'll take it. Why don't you come over. Let's see if it will fit in my bedroom. 

ELAINE

Oh, all right. 

KRAMER

My old one sprung a leak. 

ELAINE

You have a water bed? 

KRAMER

Sand! It's like sleeping on the beach. 

CONRAD

Hi, Jerry I'm sorry I'm late. George and I have been up working all night long. I can make up the time in any number of ways. 

JERRY

How about this? . . . Finish this thing up today! 

CONRAD

Couple of questions for you. 

JERRY

No. No more questions. Just figure it out for yourself and get it done. 

CONRAD

All right Jerry. But I can figure it out myself any way you want. 

JERRY

Just . . . do it. 

STEINBRENNER

Costanza? Where's Costanza? . . . Excus&eacute; mois? Have you seen Costanza? 

SECRETARY

I've seen him around. 

STEINBRENNER

Um, I'm stuck on this song yesterday. I can't seem to get it out of my head. I don't know the name of that. 'She's a heart breaker, love taker . . ..Oh. Oh' . . .very catchy. You know what? I can't stay awake for that guy. What is this? People? Um, the most beautiful people people. Ally Selica, Nothing wrong with that uh? 

HAL

Elaine, your taking this totally the wrong way. That's not what Ii intended. 

ELAINE

Well, what did you intend, Hal? 

HAL

I just wanted you to have the comfort and report you deserve. That's why I had the mattress custom designed for you. 

ELAINE

Custom designed? 

HAL

They adjust the foam density and spring tension to your body type. I estimated your height and weight. Five eight, about 110 pounds? 

ELAINE

Uh, that is the nicest thing anyone has ever done for me. 

HAL

So you do like the mattress? 

ELAINE

Oh, I love it. I'm glad . . . I kept it. 

FATHER

Over there, that's Brooklyn . That's where Spike Lee lives. 

SON

Hey, there's a man swimming in the water. 

FATHER

Naw, that's probably just a dead body son. You see when the mob kills someone they through the body in the river. 

KRAMER

Jer. 

JERRY

Hi. 

KRAMER

Well my swimming pool problems are solved. I just found myself miles and miles of open lanes. 

JERRY

What is that smell? 

KRAMER

That's East River. 

JERRY

You're swimming in the East River? The most heavily trafficked overly contaminated waterway on the eastern seaboard? 

KRAMER

Technically Norfok has more gross tonnage. 

JERRY

How could you swim in that water? 

KRAMER

I saw a couple of other guys out there. 

JERRY

Swimming? 

KRAMER

Floating, they weren't moving much. But they were out there. 

ELAINE

(on phone) Hey, Kramer, it's Elaine, thanks for bringing my mattress back. And I guess I'll just get my spare key from you - whenever. All right, bye. 

ELAINE

Oh, this is a good mattress. Sniff, sniff, Ugh! 

STEINBRENNER

What is with this guy? I've been waiting three and a half hours. Should I go? No way Jack! ??? at the registrar again, I'll tell you that. 

STEINBRENNER

That's what they call me. 

STEINBRENNER

Oh, well, send them in. Send the little tykes in. ... little people .. pony express ... wow, 

JERRY

(on phone) hello. 

GEORGE

Jerry, I'm trapped under my desk. Steinbrenner is in the room. You got to help[ me. 

JERRY

Who is this? 

GEORGE

Jerry, . . . 

BRADY

Hi, 

GEORGE

Sh, sh, goodbye, sh, get away. 

BRADY

Hi, I'm Brady. 

GEORGE

?? get away?? 

JERRY

Why don't you just have him paged? 

GEORGE

Can't you think of something. Call in a bomb threat. 

JERRY

A bomb threat? Why would I call in a bomb threat? 

GEORGE

Just CALL! 

JERRY

I should have some reason. 

STEINBRENNER

Hey you kids know tunes; see if this song rinSTEINBRENNER a bell, 'Heartbreaker , . . . ' 

STEINBRENNER

A bomb in the building, oh, m'god. Quick, everyone under the desk. 

STEINBRENNER

Boy can you think of what went through my mind when I saw there wasn't going to be enough room under that desk for me and my babies. 

GEORGE

I'm sorry sir. 

STEINBRENNER

You know what I think? I think you knew about that bomb ahead of time. 

GEORGE

What? 

STEINBRENNER

???? about that bomb. You climbed under that desk because you have ESP. George, what's on my mind? . . . Meatballs! Huh? Unbelievable. Anyway this terrorist had a specific demand. Not more cheap adjustable hats on hat day. He wants fitted hats just like the players wear. 

ELAINE

Jerry, Jerry. 

JERRY

Yeah. 

ELAINE

What the hell is this? Where are you? 

JERRY

Over here. You can see right through here. 

ELAINE

What is this. It's like you're selling movie tickets back here. 

JERRY

It's kind of cozy. 

ELAINE

Hey, you're not going to believe what Kramer did to my mattress. . . . I can't talk to you like this. So Kramer completely funked up my mattress. 

JERRY

Does it smell like the East River? 

ELAINE

How did you know? 

JERRY

Because Kramer has been swimming laps between the Queensborough bridge and the Brooklyn bridge. 

ELAINE

Oh, GREAT! 

KRAMER

Oh man, I'm on the wrong floor again. 

ELAINE

Hey, thanks for ruining my mattress. It reeks. 

KRAMER

Hey, you know what I think it is? I think it's that East River. I think it might be polluted. 

GEORGE

Well, you really did it to me this time, Seinfeld. . . . What the hell happened here? 

ELAINE

Hi. 

GEORGE

Hi. Look at how obtrusive this is. 

ELAINE

It is obtrusive, isn't it? 

KRAMER

It is very obtrusive. 

JERRY

I don't think it's that bad. 

KRAMER

You can't get a stool in here. 

JERRY

No the stools go over there. 

KRAMER

No, that's no good. I'm leaving. 

ELAINE

I'm with you. I'm going back to my place. 

GEORGE

Fitted Hat Day! That's what you asked Steinbrenner for? 

JERRY

You mean they're actually doing the fitted hats? Cool. 

GEORGE

Guess who he put in charge of Fitted Hat Day? Me. 

JERRY

Hey look at you. 

GEORGE

Yeah, look at me. Now I GOTTA FIGURE OUT THE HAT SIZES OF 59,000 DIFFERENT PEOPLE!! WHAT IF A PINHEAD SHOWS UP. I GOTTA BE ON TOP OF THAT. 

JERRY

No knock offs. I want the ones like the real players wear. 

GEORGE

??? KNOCK OFFS. I NOT GOING TO DO IT! AND YOU'RE GOING TO CALL STEINBRENNER BACK AND CANCEL THE WHOLE THING. 

JERRY

Could you at least get a hat for me? 

GEORGE

FINE? WHAT SIZE? 

JERRY

Seven and five eighths 

GEORGE

SEVEN AND FIVE EIGHTHS!! 

JERRY

Why are you shouting? 

GEORGE

I DON'T KNOW. It's this place. I'm very uncomfortable here. 

HAL

So are you liking the mattress? 

ELAINE

I am totally loving it. Uh, you know ... we should um ... get going. 

HAL

What is that smell? 

ELAINE

What smell? 

HAL

I think it's the mattress. Did something happen to it. 

ELAINE

No no, oh, you know what that is? I um, went claming the other day and I forgot to hose off my boots. 

HAL

Claming? 

ELAINE

Yeah, clam and scallop. I clam and scallop. 

STEINBRENNER

Yes, yes, come in. 

GEORGE

Sir, I just got a call from the terrorist. I told him to call back here. 

STEINBRENNER

Just let me ask you something. Is it 'February' or ' February'? Because I prefer 'Febuary' and what is this 'ru'? 

GEORGE

Let me put that on speaker phone. 

STEINBRENNER

Hello are you the bomber? 

JERRY

Yes this is the terrorist bomber. 

STEINBRENNER

Costanza here is busting his ass on those hats. 

JERRY

think I've changed my mind. 

STEINBRENNER

You don't want them, then goodbye. 

GEORGE

??? sir. 

STEINBRENNER

Well what do you want instead? 

JERRY

What? 

STEINBRENNER

Well, you're the terrorist. You're going to want something. 

JERRY

I guess it would be nice if you called all the ticket holders if the game was going to be rained out. 

STEINBRENNER

All right George, you can handle that. 

STEINBRENNER

Costanza what the hell are you doing? 

GEORGE

You have to stand tough sir. That's why I had to hang up the phone. 

STEINBRENNER

You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to run around the stadium and close all the windows. That's where I'm going, pal. And I'll tell you something else. I'm very nervous. 

ELAINE

Gotta get some of that stuffed crust pizza. cheese crust pizza. 

HAL

It's just more cheese. 

ELAINE

I'll tell you something. It'll be years before they find places to hide more cheese on a pizza. Kramer! 

KRAMER

Oh, hey, 

ELAINE

Oh, hi. This is Hal. Hal, this is Kramer. Kramer, Hal. 

KRAMER

Hal, .. uh Langerhans. 

HAL

Kitzmiller. 

KRAMER

Oh, Kitzmiller. That's right 

ELAINE

You feeling jiff? 

KRAMER

Oh, I'm jiff. 

HAL

That smell... 

KRAMER

Oh, listen I gotta get to the pier. The ferry traffic is really bad around four thirty. Look, I still got the key to your apartment and I'll get it back to you as soon as I can. 

ELAINE

Oh, baby. 

GEORGE

Finished. 

HAL

Kramer? Can I talk to you a minute? 

KRAMER

Yeah, sure, um, oh boy, . . . 

HAL

Kitzmiller. 

KRAMER

That's it. 

HAL

You and Elaine are pretty close. 

KRAMER

Oh, we go back a ways. 

HAL

And you've, . . . how do I put this? You've been in her bed? 

KRAMER

That's right. 

HAL

But this isn't still going on. 

KRAMER

No, no. She put a stop to that. 

HAL

That's all I needed to know. So you actually swim in this thing? 

KRAMER

Oh yeah. Exercises every muscle in the body. It's great for the back. 

HAL

Great for the back. Right. 

KRAMER

Four hours in this chop and I'm a full inch taller. . . . Giddyup. 

STEINBRENNER

'Heatbreaker, Brewbaker, ...' Hey George, I remember that tune. George? George? Um, what's that ticking. Oh oh. Oh, oooh,...wo wo wo wo . [runs out] fire in the hole! 

ELAINE

I wouldn't believe the Lumbar Yard wouldn't pick this up. Ug, oh, okay, . . . 

CONRAD

You want it back the way it was? 

JERRY

Yeah, that's right. 

CONRAD

You know I don't get you Seinfeld. You want something one day. The next day you don't like it. Come on man, make a decision. 

JERRY

One second. Hello. 

ELAINE

Jerry you gotta help me. I threw my back out. 

JERRY

Just lie down. 

ELAINE

I am lying down. I am trapped under a funky mattress. I gotta go get a doctor or at least come over and roll this thing off of me. 

JERRY

All right. I'll be right there., Conrad I gotta go. 

CONRAD

Stay, go whatever. 

HAL

Hey, Kramer. 

KRAMER

What's going on? 

HAL

I told my Chiropractor how swimming in the river made my back heal. He recommended it to all his patients. 

MAN

Step aside. 

KRAMER

He just sunk like a stone. 

GEORGE

Sir, I'm sure it's not a police matter. 

STEINBRENNER

Don't be so sure George. Mess with them and they're messing with you. All right boys send it in 

STEINBRENNER

What's that figure ahead? Is that anything? Okay, let's check the desk. That's where I heard the ticking. Search each one of those drawers starting with the top one. So, empty calories and male curiosity, eh, Georgie? 

COP

Looks like there's more compartments underneath. 

STEINBRENNER

Compartments underneath, that's probably where it is. Okay boys, let 'er rip. I'll tell you what George. Starting tomorrow no more desks. Just Lucite tables and four leSTEINBRENNER. 

KRAMER

Hey, watch where you're kicking! 

ELAINE

Kramer. 

KRAMER

Elaine 

ELAINE

I can't believe it. Hey, I'll meet you at the coffee shop. 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

ELAINE

Yeah. 

GEORGE

Hi Connie, Jerry around? 

CONRAD

No, and I prefer 'Conrad'. So I heard what happened to the desk. 

GEORGE

There was something so reassuring about that cozy little space. 

CONRAD

Yeah, well, whatever. See ya' 

JERRY

Ah, back to normal. Not bad for four thousand bucks. . . . I can't believe I got the Low Fat! 

GEORGE

So, Marcy, you should've seen me in the hot tub yoday. 

MARCY

Why? 

GEORGE

I was naked. 

MARCY

Oh, George. 

JERRY

I saw it. 

MARCY

How'd he look? 

JERRY

Okay. I wouldn't see it again. 

MARCY

You know, a friend of mine thought she got Legonare's disease in the hot tub. 

GEORGE

Really? What happened? 

MARCY

Oh, yada yada yada, just some bad egg salad. I'll be right back. (She gets up) 

JERRY

I noticed she's big on the phrase 'yada yada.' 

GEORGE

Is 'yada yada' bad? 

JERRY

No, 'yada yada' is good. She's very succinct. 

GEORGE

She is succinct. 

JERRY

Yeah, it's like you're dating USA Today. (Tim the dentist enters Monk's) 

GEORGE

Hey. 

JERRY

Hey, George, you know Tim Whatley. 

GEORGE

Yeah, dentist of the stars. 

JERRY

What's up? 

TIM

I'll tell you what's up. I'm a Jew. 

JERRY

Excuse me? 

TIM

I'm a Jew. I finished converting two days ago. 

JERRY

Well... (Thinking of something to say) Welcome aboard. 

TIM

Thanks. 

GEORGE

Hey, where you just at the health club? 

TIM

Oh, well, I didn't do much. I just sat in the sauna. You know, it was more like a Jewish workout. I'll see ya. (Jerry and George give confused looks) 

JERRY

Elaine, the guy's Jewish two days, he's already making Jewish jokes. 

ELAINE

So what? When someone turns twenty-one, they usually get drunk the first night. 

JERRY

Booze is not a religion. 

ELAINE

Tell that to my father. Anyway, guess what? Beth Lookner called me. 

JERRY

Ooh. Beth Lookner, still waitin' out hat marriage. 

ELAINE

What are you talking about? That marriage ended six months ago. She's already remarried. 

JERRY

I gotta get on that internet. I'm late on everything. 

ELAINE

Anyway, Beth and her new husband Arnie have listed me a reference for an adoption agency. They're trying to get a baby. (Kramer and Mickey enter wearing the same shirt) 

KRAMER

Elaine, all right, who looks better in this shirt? Me or Mickey? 

MICKEY

We're double dating tonight, and if we wear the same shirt we'll look like idiots. 

ELAINE

Hmm, turn around. (They turn around) Both so striking. 

KRAMER

Tell me about it. We just picked up two women at the Gap. 

ELAINE

How did you decide which one of you would date which girl? (They pause then look at each other) 

MARCY

So I'm on 3rd Avenue, mindin' my own business, and, yada yada yada, I get a free massage and a facial. 

GEORGE

What a succinct story. 

MARCY

I'm surprised you drive a Cadillac. 

GEORGE

Oh, it's not mine. It's my mother's. 

MARCY

Are you close with your parents? 

GEORGE

Well, they gave birth to me, and, yada yada... 

MARCY

Yada what? 

GEORGE

Yada yada yada... 

KAREN

(To Mickey, wearing the shirt Elaine looked at for them) I like your shirt. 

MICKEY

Oh, thank you. It's 100 cotton, and some wool. 

KRAMER

Well, you too seem to have the same taste. 

JULIE

Well I like it, too. 

KRAMER

Well I have the same shirt. 

MICKEY

Yeah, well I'm wearin' it. 

JULIE

I like your shirt too. 

KAREN

Oh, so do I. 

KRAMER

Oh. (Waiter approaches table) 

WAITER

Anything to drink? Some wine, perhaps. 

MICKEY

I like Merlot. 

KAREN

I love Merlot. 

JULIE

I'm crazy about Merlot. 

KRAMER

I live for Merlot. 

WAITER

We're out of Merlot. 

AGENT

So you, uh, know Betha and Arnie pretty well? 

ELAINE

Oh, yeah, yeah. 

AGENT

Do you socialize with them often? 

ELAINE

Yeah, we got out to dinner a lot. Usually Chinese, well sometimes Thai. And we go to the movies, Arnie's a real film buff. 

AGENT

Oh. 

ELAINE

Actually, I remember this one time, um, this is funny. Um, we went to see the movie Striptease. I don't know if you've seen... doesn't matter. Anyway, I was whispering something to Beth, and Arnie leens over to me, and he goes, 'Would you SHUT UP?!' I mean, he barely even knew me. Where did he get ah-- But they're nice people. (Elaine tries to smile realizing her mistake) 

GEORGE

Oh, you're in here. 

JERRY

What're you doing here? 

GEORGE

I knew you had an appointment. 

JERRY

Well this is very awkward. 

GEORGE

I'll leave when the guy comes in. I gotta tell you, I am loving this yada yada thing. You know, I can cross over my whole life story. (Picks up dental tool) 

JERRY

Hey, you don't play with that. That's going in my mouth. 

GEORGE

Hey, what this thing? Whew! 

JERRY

All right, that's enough. Now get going. Get outta here. (Tim and his staff enter) 

GEORGE

Hey, Tim. Quick question. Is it normal for your teeth to make noises, like a hissing or a chirping? 

JERRY

George... 

TIM

Um... 

GEORGE

Fine, I'll make an appointment. (He leaves) 

TIM

All right, it is cavity time. Ah, here we go. Which reminds me, did you here the one about the rabbi and the farmer's daughter? Huh? 

JERRY

Hey. 

TIM

Those aren't mahtzah balls. 

JERRY

Tim, do you think you should be making jokes like that? 

TIM

Why not? I'm Jewish, remember? 

JERRY

I know, but... 

TIM

Jerry, it's our sense of humor that sustained us as a people for 3000 years. 

JERRY

5000. 

TIM

5000, even better. Okay, Chrissie. Give me a schtickle of flouride. 

JERRY

And then he asked the assistant for a schtickle of flouride. 

ELAINE

Why are you so concerned about this? 

JERRY

I'll tell you why. Because I believe Whatley converted to Judaism just for the jokes. (Phone rings) 

PHONE

Would you be interested in a subscription to the New York Times? 

JERRY

Yes. (Slams down phone. Kramer and Mickey enter) 

KRAMER

I don't believe that. 

MICKEY

If you had gotten into the backseat of the car we could've figured this whole thing out. 

KRAMER

Why were you holding the door open for? 

MICKEY

Not for you! Who holds a door open for a man? 

KRAMER

Well, I thought it was a nice gesture. But I guess I was wrong! 

MICKEY

Let's just put they're names in a hat. 

KRAMER

I don't even know their names! Look, why don't you just take the one that was on the left? 

MICKEY

I'm not sure she was my type. 

KRAMER

Oh, everybody's your type. 

MICKEY

What the hell does that mean? 

KRAMER

You've been married three times. 

MICKEY

That's it, it's go time! (Charges toward Kramer, only to be held back by Jerry and Elaine) 

JERRY

All right, take it easy. 

ELAINE

Hey, hey, hey! 

KRAMER

Come on, let him go. You want throw? Let's throw! 

ELAINE

Hey! Hold on a second. All right, look, I got an idea. Why don't you just show up early for your next date, sit across from each other, and see who the girls sit next to. 

MICKEY

That's not bad. 

KRAMER

All right, so we let the girls decide. 

MICKEY

Yeah, why should we knock ourselves out? 

KRAMER

Yeah, I wanna wear that shirt next time. 

MICKEY

No, no one wears the shirt next time. 

KRAMER

That's right, 'cause they already saw it. 

MICKEY

We'll look like idiots. (They exit) 

GEORGE

Well, we were engaged to be married, uh, we bought the wedding invitations, and, uh, yada yada yada, I'm still single. 

MARCY

So what's she doing now? 

GEORGE

Yada. 

MARCY

Speaking of ex's, my old boyfriend came over late last night, and, yada yada yada, anyway. I'm really tired today. 

ELAINE

Beth, Arnie, hi. What's up? 

ARNIE

Well our adoption application was denied. 

ELAINE

Really. 

BETH

The adoption agent seems to feel that Arnie has a violent temper. 

ELAINE

Oh. 

BETH

So we're just asking our friends what they may have said to the adoption agent. 

ELAINE

Uh, you know, I just told them what kind people you are and, uh, yada yada yada, that is it. 

JERRY

How you doing? 

FATHER

I have a discomfort in my molar. (Enter Tim) 

TIM

Well, the Curtis, why don't you come in? (To Jerry) Father Curtis, good guy. Oh, which reminds me, did you hear the one about the Pope and Raquel Welch on the lifeboat, huh? I'll tell you later. (Exits) 

JERRY

Whatley. (Like 'Newman') 

KRAMER

What are they doing here? 

MICKEY

I told you we should've gotten here a half hour early. 

KRAMER

All right, all right. Now what're we gonna do? 

MICKEY

All right, don't panic. Let's just decide now. Which one do you want? 

KRAMER

All right, I'll take Julie. 

MICKEY

I knew you wanted her. That's who I wanted. 

KRAMER

All right, I'll take Karen. 

MICKEY

No, no, you think I'm fallin' for that? I'll take Karen. 

KRAMER

All right, which one is Julie? (They walk over to the table and fight over who sits where) Hey, you ladies look lovely tonight. (Continue to struggle) 

JERRY

So Whatley sayd to me, 'Hey, I can make Catholic jokes, I used to be Catholic.' 

ELAINE

You see, I don't think it is a Catholic joke. I think it's more of a Raquel Welch joke. What was it? No, I said hand me the buoys. (Laughing) Bouys! 

JERRY

Don't you see what Whatley is after? Total joke telling immunity. He's already got the two big religions covered, if he ever gets Polish citizenship there'll be no stopping him. 

ELAINE

So what're you gonna do? 

JERRY

I think this Father Curtis might be very interested to hear what Whatley has the Pope doing with Raquel Welch. 

ELAINE

(Calling on phone) Hey, Beth, Arnie, it's Elaine. Um, thought you guys might wanna have lunch. Gimme a call. Bye. 

JERRY

They're not getting a baby so you're taking them out to lunch? 

ELAINE

Thought it would be nice. 

JERRY

Poor Beth. 

ELAINE

Hey, Arnie's just as upset. 

JERRY

Oh screw him! (George enters) 

GEORGE

Listen to this. Marcy comes up and she tells me her ex-boyfriend was over late last night, and 'yada yada yada, I'm really tired today.' You don't think she yada yada'd sex. 

ELAINE

(Raising hand) I've yada yada'd sex. 

GEORGE

Really? 

ELAINE

Yeah. I met this lawyer, we went out to dinner, I had the lobster bisk, we went back to my place, yada yada yada, I never heard from him again. 

JERRY

But you yada yada'd over the best part. 

ELAINE

No, I mentioned the bisk. 

GEORGE

Well, I gotta do somethin'. (Walks over to bathroom. Kramer enters) 

KRAMER

Well, I gotta do somethin'. 

JERRY

George is already in there. 

KRAMER

(Confused) No, Mickey and I, we can't work it out. You know, I'm thinking of asking that Karen out by myself. 

JERRY

I thought you were leaning towards Julie. 

KRAMER

I was, but the one I thought was Julie turned out to be Karen. 

GEORGE

Well it was a helluva yada yada. 

MARCY

He's moving to Seattle. We wanted to say goodbye, I was just getting out of the shower, and yada yada yada-- 

GEORGE

All right, enough! Enough! From now on, no more yada yada's. Just give me the full story. 

MARCY

Okay. 

GEORGE

Tell me about the free facial. 

MARCY

Okay, well, like I said I was on 3rd Avenue, and I stopped by a large department store. 

GEORGE

Which one? 

MARCY

Bloomingdale's. 

GEORGE

Very good. Go on. 

MARCY

Oh, and I stole a Piaget watch. 

GEORGE

What's that? 

MARCY

And then, I was on such a... high, that I went upstairs to the salon on the fifth floor, and got a massage and facial, and skipped out on the bill. 

GEORGE

Shoplifting. 

MARCY

Well, what about you? You told me that you were engaged. What was the rest of that? (Pause) 

JERRY

Excuse me, Mother? 

NUN

Sister. 

JERRY

Sister, right. Do you know when Father Curtis has office hours? 

NUN

Well not until tomorrow. 

JERRY

Hmm, I really need to speak with him. 

FATHER

That's a kneeler. 

JERRY

Oh. (Adjusts accordingly) 

FATHER

Tell me your sins, my son. 

JERRY

Well I should tell you that I'm Jewish. 

FATHER

That's no sin. 

JERRY

Oh good. Anyway, I wanted to talk to you about Dr. Whatley. I have a suspicion that he's converted to Judaism just for the jokes. 

FATHER

And this offends you as a Jewish person. 

JERRY

No, it offends me as a comedian. And it'll interest you that he's also telling Catholic jokes. 

FATHER

Well. 

JERRY

And they're old jokes. I mean, the Pope and Raquel Welch in a lifeboat. 

FATHER

I haven't heard that one. 

JERRY

Oh, I'm sure you have. They're out on the ocean and, yada yada yada, and she says, 'Those aren't buoys.' (Father starts laughing) Father... 

FATHER

One second... Well, if it would make you feel better I could speak to Dr. Whatley. I have to go back and have a wisdom teeth removed. 

JERRY

You know the difference between a dentist and a sadist don't you? 

FATHER

Um... 

JERRY

Newer magazines. 

FATHER

Now if you'll excuse me. (Closes door. George enters confessional.) 

GEORGE

Jerry, I gotta talk to you. 

KRAMER

Hi. 

KAREN

Hi, Kramer. 

KRAMER

Got a minute? 

KAREN

Uh, actually my parents are over, but, would you like to meet them? 

KRAMER

Sure. 

KAREN

(Parents enter and are little people like Mickey) Mom, Dad. 

KRAMER

Hi. 

ARNIE

Elaine, I have to ask you something. What exactly happened down there? 

ELAINE

Well, I don't know. I mean, I talked to him and, blah blah blah, he asked about you guys and, da da da da da, more questions, bleh bleh bleh.... 

ARNIE

All right, shut up! 

ELAINE

Again you are telling me to shut up? 

ARNIE

What? 

ELAINE

You yelled that time at the movies. That's why you're not getting the baby. 

ARNIE

Oh my God. How am I gonna tell Beth? 

ELAINE

Look, I'll go down and talk to this adoption guy and I'll make sure that it all gets worked out. 

ARNIE

All right, just don't screw it up this time! (He exits) 

ELAINE

See, again with the yelling. Not a fan of the yelling. 

JERRY

(In pain) Oh, are you about done? 

TIM

I'm just getting warmed up. Because I'm just a sadist with newer magazines. 

JERRY

Huh? 

TIM

Father Curtis told me about your little joke. 

JERRY

What about all your Jewish jokes? 

TIM

I'm Jewish, you're not a dentist. You have no idea what my people have been through. 

JERRY

The Jews? 

TIM

No, the dentists. You know, we have the highest suicide rate of any profession? 

JERRY

Is that why it's so hard to get an appointment? 

KRAMER

So, I'll uh... all right. (Hangs up) 

JERRY

Date with Karen? 

KRAMER

No, Julie. She's the one. 

JERRY

What happened to Karen? 

KRAMER

Well, Mickey and her have a lot more in common. you know her parents are little people? 

JERRY

Oh, small world. So little people can have not little people children? 

KRAMER

Oh yeah, and vice versa. Mother Nature's a mad scientist, Jerry. 

JERRY

So you won't believe what happened with Whatley today. It got back to hime that I made this little dentist joke and he got all offended. Those people can be so touchy. 

KRAMER

Those people, listen to yourself. 

JERRY

What? 

KRAMER

You think that dentists are so different from me and you? They came to this country just like everybody else, in search of a dream. 

JERRY

Kramer, he's just a dentist. 

KRAMER

Yeah, and you're an anti-dentite. 

JERRY

I am not an anti-dentite! 

KRAMER

You're a rabid anti-dentite! Oh, it starts with a few jokes and some slurs. 'Hey, denty!' Next thing you know you're saying they should have their own schools. 

JERRY

They do have their own schools! 

KRAMER

Yeah! 

ELAINE

One little baby, whatever you have in stock. 

AENT

Miss Benes... 

ELAINE

Look it, look it, Ryan. These people are gettin' a baby. Period. Now we can do this the easy way, or we can do this the fun way. 

BETH

Jerry, I'm sorry to bother you, but you always said you'd be there for me. 

JERRY

Well, what's wrong? 

BETH

I'm thinking of leaving Arnie. 

JERRY

Talk to me. 

BETH

He met with Elaine, and I asked him what happened, and he yada yada'd me. I mean, could he be having an affair? 

JERRY

Well, I wouldn't put anything past anybody. 

BETH

But we just got married. 

JERRY

Well obviously that was a mistake. You need to forget about Arnie. The important thing is you're moving on. 

BETH

Why would Elaine do that to me? 

JERRY

Forget about Elaine. Let's just focus on us. Come on, big hug. (Mickey and Karen enter) 

MICKEY

Hey Jerry. Where's Kramer? I've got exciting news. 

JERRY

I'm kinda in the middle of something. 

MICKEY

Karen and I are getting married. 

JERRY

Oh, congratulations. Her marriage just fell apart. 

MICKEY

(To Beth) How many is that for you? 

BETH

Two. 

MICKEY

You're a lightweight. Come on, honey. 

ELAINE

Hey Jerry. What are you doing here with Beth? 

JERRY

Beth and Arnie broke up. 

ELAINE

So they don't want a baby? 

JERRY

(Shaking his head no) Pff. 

ELAINE

(Realizes her mistake) I think I'm gonna be sick. (George enters alone) 

JERRY

Hey, where's Marcy? 

GEORGE

She, uh, went shopping for some shoes for the wedding and, yada yada yada, I'll see her in six to eight months. (Kramer and Julie enter) 

JERRY

Hey, Kramer, over here. 

KRAMER

I just assume not sit next to you. 

JERRY

Kramer... Oh look, there's Mickey and his parents. 

ELAINE

Nice looking family. 

JERRY

Very handsome. 

KRAMER

(To Mr. Abbott) How ya doing? 

ABBOTT

Hey Kramer. 

JULIE

Oh Mickey. Excuse me, I can't take this. (She exits quickly) 

JERRY

Hi, Mr. Abbott. 

ABBOTT

That's Dr. Abbott, D.D.S. Tim Whatley was one of my students. And if this wasn't my son's wedding day, I'd knock you teeth out you anti-dentite bastard. 

BETH

What was that all about? 

JERRY

Oh, I said something about dentists and it got blown all out of proportion. 

BETH

Hey, what do you call a doctor who fails out of med school? 

JERRY

What? 

BETH

A dentist. (They laugh) 

JERRY

That's a good one. Dentists. 

BETH

Yeah, who needs 'em? Not to mention the Blacks and the Jews. (Jerry fakes a smile) 

ELAINE

Where's Beth? 

JERRY

She went out to get her head shaved. 

FATHER

We are gathered her today to unite this couple in holy... matrimony. 

JERRY

Those wisdom teeth are tough to get out. 

FATHER

Marriage is not an intervention to be entered lightly... Yada yada yada, I pronounce you man and wife. (They kiss, walk toward exit) 

KAREN

(To Kramer) I really wanted you. 

ELAINE

Uh, excuse me. 

GLADYS

Be with you in a minute. (turns her back to Elaine and continues into phone) No, you shoulda come last night, it was fun. 

ELAINE

Uhm, I just have a question. 

GLADYS

(into phone) I know, the margaritas in that place are so strong. 

ELAINE

(walks up to counter) Helloo? I'd like to buy these hirachis. 

GLADYS

(into phone) So? What else is goin' on? 

ELAINE

(shouts) HEY!! 

GLADYS

Listen, I'll call you back. (to Elaine) Yes? What can I do for you? 

ELAINE

(tosses the hirachis onto the counter) Nothing. You, just lost a customer. 

VALERIE

Ready to go? I don't wanna miss the previews. 

JERRY

Me neither. I love the previews. In fact I enjoy being in the theatre cut up(?). Last week after a preview, I yelled out 'Must miss'. 

VALERIE

I think that I was in that theatre. That, that was really funny. 

JERRY

Yeah, it got a good laugh. Let me just check my messages before we go. 

GEORGE

So you're on the speed dial? 

JERRY

After two dates! 

GEORGE

What number? 

JERRY

Seven. 

GEORGE

Wha! You know, it's a pain to change that. You gotta lift up that plastic thing with a pen. 

KRAMER

Uh, hey buddy. 

JERRY

Hey. 

KRAMER

It all right if I keep these here for a while? I'm having a New Year's Eve party. 

JERRY

You're gonna keep these here for eight months?! 

KRAMER

No, Jerry. New Year's Eve nineteen ninety-nine. The millennium. I told you about that. 

JERRY

Kramer, you're gonna leave these chairs here for two and a half years?! 

KRAMER

You're not gonna see 'em. I got a case of party poppers I'm gonna keep in front of 'em. 

GEORGE

Hey, so get this. I get a call this morning from one of the Mets front office guys. They wanna take me out to lunch. 

JERRY

What for? 

GEORGE

(smiling) I'm on a winning ball club, Jerry. They probably wanna pick my brains. 

JERRY

Really, why d'you think they're taking you out to lunch? 

GEORGE

(thoughtful) I have no idea. 

ELAINE

Alright, I have had it with those Mayans. 

JERRY

I don't mind the Mayans. 

ELAINE

(unfolding chair) You know that store, Putumayo? (sits) I was trying to buy these hirachis, right, and the saleswoman just completely ignored me. 

KRAMER

What, we talking hirachis? I know a great store for hirachis. 

ELAINE

No, no, not Putumayo. 

KRAMER

No, no. Cinqo de Mayo. (leaving) Yeah, Marcellino, he turned me on to it, and he's one sixty-fourth Mayan. 

GEORGE

(slightly worried) You know, I'm starting to get a little nervous about this lunch. 

ELAINE

What'd you have? 

KRAMER

Yeah, I'm gonna keep these here too, huh? They'll be alright. (begins to leave) 

JERRY

Kramer, these balloons aren't gonna stay filled till New Year's! 

KRAMER

(at the door) Well, those aren't for New Year's. Those are my everyday balloons. 

MINKLER

George, we'll be blunt. The Mets need somebody to head up scouting, and we think that someone might be you. 

GEORGE

(surprise) Head of scouting? 

MOONEY

Interested? 

GEORGE

(playing it cool) I'm still here. 

MINKLER

Now, unfortunately, league rules prevent us from making you an offer while you're still under contract. 

MOONEY

You understand what we're talking about? 

GEORGE

So you're talking... 

MINKLER

No, no. 

MOONEY

We're *not* talking. We're just, talking. 

GEORGE

So, you need me to get fired. 

MINKLER

We didn't say that. 

MOONEY

We couldn't say that, because even if we did... 

MINKLER

...we couldn't say that we said it. 

MOONEY

You see what we're saying? 

GEORGE

(jokingly) You are still paying for this lunch? 

MINKLER

(serious) We didn't say that. 

JERRY

Hi. Sorry I'm late. There's a lotta chairs and balloons in my apartment. How 'bout I make it up to you with dinner? 

VALERIE

(pointedly) Someplace nice this time? 

JERRY

Yeah, I'm sorry about that Mongolian barbecue last night. I'd heard good things. 

VALERIE

(rising) I don't know, got a two in Zagat's. 

JERRY

Lemme just check my messages. (to himself) Maybe a nicer girl called. 

VOICE

Hello? 

JERRY

Hello? Who's this? 

VOICE

Jane. What number did you dial? 

JERRY

Seven? 

ELAINE

Hey! See these? (raises her foot so her new hirachis can be seen) Cinqo de Mayo! Sales commission, bye-bye-o! (waves) 

GEORGE

(singing) Meet the Mets... 

GEORGE

...meet the Mets. Come on in and greet the Mets. 

JERRY

Good meeting? 

GEORGE

There was no meeting. (gets one of the folding chairs) But it was quite a meeting. You are looking at the next director of Mets scouting. The only thing is, I have to get fired from the Yankees first. 

JERRY

You can do that. 

GEORGE

Of course. But I really wanna leave my mark this time, you know, uh. I wanna walk away from the Yankees with people saying 'Wow! Now that guy got canned!' 

JERRY

So you want to go out in a final blaze of incompetence? 

GEORGE

Ehh. (nostalgic) Remember that summer at Dairy Queen where I cooled my feet in the soft-serve machine? 

KRAMER

You think people will still be using napkins in the year two-thousand? Or is this mouth-vacuum thing for real? 

JERRY

So, George... 

GEORGE

Yeah. 

JERRY

(rising) I had like a so-so date with Valerie, now I'm number nine on the speed-dial. 

GEORGE

So? 

JERRY

So? I used to be seven. I dropped two spots. 

GEORGE

What, she's ranking you? 

JERRY

Yeah, this speed-dial's like a relationship barometer. 

GEORGE

What is a barometer exactly? 

KRAMER

It's pronounced thermometer. 

KRAMER

You know, in the year two-thousand, we'll all be on speed-dial. You'll just have to think of a person, they'll be talking to you. It'll be like, wup (judders and puts his hands to his temples, as if receiving a call on a 'mental phone') getting a call here. 

KRAMER

(to Jerry and George) Hey, it's Newman. (to 'mental phone') Hey, how you doing, Newman? 

KRAMER

(to 'mental phone') Oh, you wanna talk to Jerry? 

VALERIE

(pleased) Oh, flowers. You didn't have to do that. I mean, the dinner, and the play, and the hansom cab ride. 

JERRY

Well, I just wanted to... (breaks off) You forgot the gift certificate to Barnes and Noble. 

VALERIE

Oh. 

JERRY

(resumes) ...you know, make a good impression. 

VALERIE

I'm gonna go put these in some water. 

JERRY

I like the way you think. 

JERRY

Oh my God! Number one!! Seinfeld, you magnificent bastard! 

GEORGE

Sorry I'm late, but look what I found in the Yankee Hall of Pride display case. 

WILHELM

Isn't that Babe Ruth's uniform? 

GEORGE

Is it? (reaches into bag) 

GEORGE

Huh, strawberries, anyone? (eats a strawberry) Ah, that's good. Ooh, juicy this time of year. 

GEORGE

Gotta get the good ones. 

GEORGE

Oh, that's bad. That's bad. 

KRAMER

So Jerry, my millennium party's really coming together. Will people be able to breathe underwater in the year two-thousand? 

JERRY

Some of us. 

KRAMER

(crumpling a piece of paper) I don't wanna exclude anybody. 

JERRY

Hola. 

ELAINE

Shove it! 

JERRY

What is all this? 

ELAINE

I got all this junk at Cinqo de Mayo, because I was trying to show Putumayo how much business they'd lost. I mean, I been dancing (demonstrates dance) and strutting in front of their store for two days. 

JERRY

Ah, no wonder we're getting so much rain. 

KRAMER

Elaine, I'm having a millennium party, so save the date. 

ELAINE

Hey, you know what? Newman sent me an invitation already, to his party. 

KRAMER

Newman? 

ELAINE

Yeah. 

KRAMER

(reads) Come celebrate the millennium, with Newmanniun. Newman! 

JERRY

Hi Valerie. 

JERRY

You're not Valerie. 

HAMILTON

I'm her step-mother. Drive. 

HAMILTON

It's taken me thirteen years to climb up to the top of that speed-dial, and I don't intend to lose my spot to you. 

JERRY

But, I never... 

HAMILTON

(threatening) You just stay away from that phone. 

GEORGE

You wanted to see me, sir? 

STEINBRENNER

I heard about what happened at the meeting this morning... 

GEORGE

Oh, yes. I already packed up my desk, sir. I can be outta here in an hour. 

STEINBRENNER

...and I have to tell you, it's exactly what this organisation needed. 

STEINBRENNER

We wanna look to the future, we gotta tear down the past. Babe Ruth was nothing more than a fat old man, with little-girl legs. And here's something I just found out recently. He wasn't really a sultan. Ah, what d'you make of that? Hey, check this out. (he stands to reveal he's wearing baseball pants) Lou Gehrig's pants. Not a bad fit. (a thought occurs) Hey, you don't think that nerve disease of his was contagious, do you? Uh, I better take 'em off. I'm too important to this team. (removes the pants to reveal his boxers) Big Stein can't be flopping and twitching. 

STEINBRENNER

Hey, how 'bout some lunch. What're you going for? 

JERRY

You know uh, Valerie, I uh, couldn't help but notice that I'm on your speed-dial. 

VALERIE

You deserve it. 

JERRY

But I can't help thinking that maybe there's someone in your life who deserves it more. Someone you've known, you know, more than a week. 

VALERIE

My stepmother got to you, didn't she? 

JERRY

What? No. 

VALERIE

Uuh, I can't believe she did this again. That's it! She's off the speed-dial completely! 

JERRY

Yikes! 

KRAMER

Well, I just got your invitation to the Newmanniun party. 

NEWMAN

You just got it? Damn, the mail is slow. 

KRAMER

(getting worked up) You knew I was having a millennium party, but you just had to throw yours on the same day! 

NEWMAN

I have done nothing unethical. 

KRAMER

Yeah, well you're gonna have to cancel it, because I've told everybody about my party. 

NEWMAN

Cancel! (jumps to feet) Think again, longshanks! I started planning this in nineteen seventy-eight. I put a deposit down on that revolving restaurant that overlooks Times Square, and I booked Christopher Cross. 

KRAMER

(worked up) Well, what am I gonna do? I got over two hundred folding chairs, and quite a bit of ice. 

NEWMAN

(thoughtful) What kind? 

KRAMER

Cubed. 

NEWMAN

That's good stuff, and you can never have too much ice. Alright, I'll tell you what I'll do. You can co-host the party with me, under one condition. No Jerry. Jerry is not invited. 

KRAMER

I gotta invite Jerry. He's my buddy. 

NEWMAN

That he may be. But he's outta my life, starting in the year two-thousand. For me, the next millennium must be, Jerry-free! 

JERRY

How could they not fire you? 

GEORGE

Never thought I'd fail at failing. 

JERRY

Aw, come on there now. 

GEORGE

(depressed) Feel like I can't do anything wrong. 

JERRY

Nonsense. You do everything wrong. 

GEORGE

(hopeful) Everything? 

JERRY

Everything. 

GEORGE

You really think so? 

JERRY

Absolutely. I have no confidence in you. 

GEORGE

Alright. I guess I just have to pick myself up, dust myself off, and throw myself right back down again! 

JERRY

That's the spirit. You suck! 

GEORGE

(pleased) I know. 

ELAINE

No, no, no no, listen to me. I work in fashion. Together, we can drive Putumayo outta business and make Cinqo de Mayo numero uno... de Mayo. 

GLADYS

Do you need some help with something? 

ELAINE

(puzzled) You? What're you doing here? 

GLADYS

I own this store. 

ELAINE

No you don't. You own Putumayo. Unless you own both stores. (laughs nervously) 

GLADYS

I'm Gladys Mayo. 

ELAINE

Ah, this really sticks in my craw. 

JERRY

Well, Mrs Hamilton, it's certainly nice that you and Valerie patched things up, so we could all get together like this. Where is Valerie? 

HAMILTON

I'm sure she'll be along. (handing over a glass) Have some wine, Jerome. 

JERRY

Okay. 

HAMILTON

You know Jerome, I can understand what Valerie sees in you. So attractive, so strong, so comedic. 

JERRY

Uh, good. 

HAMILTON

Jerome, I have a deliciously naughty idea. 

JERRY

(nervous) What? 

HAMILTON

Why don't I put you on my speed-dial? 

JERRY

I don't know, Mrs Hamilton. That doesn't sound... 

HAMILTON

Don't be such a child, Jerome. How's number three sound? 

JERRY

Valerie's not coming over, is she? 

HAMILTON

Seven, four... 

JERRY

No... 

HAMILTON

Two... 

JERRY

Stop, stop. This isn't right. What about Valerie? 

HAMILTON

I won't tell if you don't. 

JERRY

(leaving hurriedly) Wuhh... 

KRAMER

Jerry... Newman... Two-thousand... 

KRAMER

(yells) Newmanniun!! 

KRAMER

(whimper) Jerry? 

KOREN

Alright, Yankees, two. Orioles, nothing. Wait a minute! A short stocky bald man is streaking across the field. 

JERRY

Oh my God, George! 

KOREN

Check that. He's not streaking. He's wearing a flesh-tone body-stocking. Apparently, he's a bit bashful, and oddly, no-one seems upset. 

JERRY

Kramer, look, it's George. 

KOREN

Everyone loves him. 

KRAMER

Yeah, yeah, I know. (he clicks off the TV) Listen, Jerry, I can't let you come to my New Year's party. 

JERRY

(neutral) Fine. 

KRAMER

(agitated) I mean, it's killing me! Newman's got the jump on the invites, and will crush me if I try to go it alone! 

JERRY

(neutral) No problem. 

KRAMER

(swung by Jerry's argument) You're right. I won't do it without you. I feel so ashamed I even thought of it, huh. 

KRAMER

(pleading) Elaine, you can't go to Newman's Newmanniun. 

ELAINE

(neutral) Okay. 

KRAMER

No, no, no. You gotta spend New Year's nineteen ninety-nine with me and Jerry. 

ELAINE

(neutral) Fine. 

KRAMER

(frustrated shout) Oh come on!! 

ELAINE

(neutral) Alright. 

KRAMER

(triumph) Yesss! Alright, so it's you, it's me, and it's Jerry, huh. (claps hands) Yeah, now things are starting to snowball, huh. I'll tell Newman I don't need him. So, I'll uh, see you two in the twenty-first century. 

ELAINE

(following Kramer to the door) Okay. Kramer, Kramer, wait a minute. Do you still have that pricing-gun? 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

ELAINE

Okay, I need you to help me put Putumayo outta business. 

KRAMER

Can do. 

JERRY

What're you doing with a pricing-gun? 

ELAINE

That place is about to have the sale of the century. Nothing over ninety-nine cents. 

JERRY

(to himself) Still a rip-off. 

JERRY

Hello? 

VALERIE

Jerry, I was just at my stepmom's house, and I saw that you were on her speed-dial. 

JERRY

Uh, well, she uh, probably just wanted to be able to keep tabs on you. 

JERRY

Hold on a second. 

JERRY

Hello? 

HAMILTON

(seductive) Hi Jerome. 

JERRY

Oh, Mrs Hamilton, this is a very bad time. I've got Valerie on the other line. Just a second. 

JERRY

Hello? 

VALERIE

That's her on the other line, isn't it? 

JERRY

Well... 

VALERIE

Tell her I don't want you on her speed-dial. 

JERRY

Hang on. 

JERRY

She knows about the speed-dial. Mrs Hamilton, you gotta get me off this thing. 

HAMILTON

I won't, until she puts me back on hers. 

JERRY

Hang on. 

JERRY

She wants to be back on yours. 

VALERIE

Fine. But only if you're off hers. 

JERRY

Hang on. 

JERRY

Fine, if I'm off yours. 

VALERIE

No, still me. 

JERRY

Sorry. Hang on. 

JERRY

Fine, if I'm off yours. 

HAMILTON

I won't do it. It's my speed-dial, and I don't trust her. 

JERRY

Please, Mrs Hamilton, this is very awkward for me. 

HAMILTON

(conspiratorial) Alright. I'll hide you in one of the emergency buttons. 

JERRY

(hurried) Great, bye. 

JERRY

She said she'll do it. 

VALERIE

Great. 

JERRY

Hang on. 

JERRY

Hello? 

GEORGE

Jerry. I can't get fired. 

FAN

Hey, body-suit man. 's up? 

FAN

(pointing) Hey, body-suit man. 

KRAMER

Hi, I'm H.E. Pennypacker. I'm a wealthy American industrialist uh, looking to open a silver mine in the mountains of Peru and uh, before I invest millions in a lucrative mine, I, I'd like to go a little native. Uh, Get the feel of their condiments, of their unmentionables, you know, the real uh, gritty-gritty. 

GLADYS

Well, lemme show you what we have. 

KRAMER

Well uh, I think I can just browse around on my own. 

KRAMER

(re the chips) Hmm, Macchu Picchu. Are these free? 

GLADYS

Yeah. 

KRAMER

Hmm-mmm. 

GLADYS

Some of those are women's clothes. 

KRAMER

Oh, not a problem. 

GEORGE

Attention Steinbrenner and front-office morons! Your triumphs mean nothing. You all stink. You can sit on it, and rotate! This is George Costanza. I fear no reprisal. Extension five-one-seven-oh. 

KRAMER

L'Occupado. 

ELAINE

Come on, what is taking you so long? 

KRAMER

Elaine, I broke the price-gun, so I had to move to plan B. 

ELAINE

Plan B? There is no plan B. 

KRAMER

(holds up some small white sachets) I took these out of every single garment in the store. 

ELAINE

What?! 

KRAMER

They're dessicates. See, they absorb moisture. (gleeful) These clothes won't last five years without 'em. 

ELAINE

That's not gonna do anything. 

KRAMER

Patience. 

ELAINE

Alright. Forget it! 

KRAMER

What? 

ELAINE

You have screwed me again, Pennypacker! 

GLADYS

Ladies, care for some chips? 

KRAMER

(emerging from the changing room) Well, I don't mind if I do. 

KRAMER

Well, I've uh, I've changed my mind. I think I'm going to build a rollercoaster instead. 

STEINBRENNER

I heard what you did in the parking lot, big boy, and it is in-excuse-a-bull. You personally insulted me, my staff... I cannot believe that you, body-suit man, could perpetrate such a disloyalty. Breaks my heart to say it... Oh, who am I kidding? I love it. You're fi... 

WILHELM

Wait, wait, Mr Steinbrenner. George doesn't deserve any of the blame for what happened in the parking lot today, sir. If there's anyone to blame here, it's me. 

STEINBRENNER

What're you talking about, Wilhelm. You popping pills? You got the crazies again? 

WILHELM

No, no. No, no, sir. I ordered George to drive around insulting people today. Because I'm tired of all your macho head games. 

GEORGE

(agitated) He's lying, sir! I'm tired of all your macho head games! 

STEINBRENNER

Macho head games? 

WILHELM

(puts arm round George's shoulder) He's just being loyal to me, sir. 

STEINBRENNER

Wilhelm, you're fired. I owe you an apology, body-suit man. Streak on. (rising) Now, if you gentlemen'll excuse me, I'm not going to the game today, I'm gonna go outside and scalp some tickets. (heads toward the door) Owner's box, that's gotta bring in forty bucks, no problem. 

GEORGE

Mr Wilhelm, what was that?! 

WILHELM

I wanted to get fired. George, you are looking at the new head scout of the New York Mets. 

WILHELM

(singing) Meet the Mets, meet the Mets. Come right out and greet the Mets. 

KRAMER

I don't know what Elaine is so upset about. I mean, without dessicates, those clothes'll be noticeably musty in five years. 

JERRY

She never sees the big picture. 

JERRY

Hello, Newman! 

NEWMAN

Hello Jerry. (to Kramer) What did you say to Elaine? I just got her cancellation in the mail. 

KRAMER

Oh, well I guess she found some place better to go. 

NEWMAN

Well, it's her mistake. Because she is going to miss the party of a lifetime. 

KRAMER

Well, maybe so, but come midnight, when she's looking for someone warm and cuddly to kiss, I guess you'll be caught between the moon and New York City. 

NEWMAN

Alright. Come back to my party, please. 

KRAMER

Jerry too, of course. 

NEWMAN

(reluctant) You don't wanna do your... act, or anything, do you? 

JERRY

No. 

NEWMAN

Alright then, I guess I can accept a little Jerry, if it gets me a (suggestive) lot of Elaine. 

KRAMER

Deal? 

NEWMAN

To the Newmanniun! (holds out his hand) 

KRAMER

(grasps Newman's hand) To the Kramennium. 

JERRY

By the way Newman, I'm just curious. When you booked the hotel, did you book it for the millennium New Year? 

NEWMAN

(smug) As a matter of fact, I did. 

JERRY

Oh, that's interesting, because as everyone knows, since there was no year zero, the millennium doesn't begin until the year two-thousand and one. Which would make your party, one year late, and thus, quite lame. 

JERRY

Aww! 

HAMILTON

I don't feel well at all. I feel all dried-out inside. 

VALERIE

I'll call for help. 

JERRY

Hello? 

VALERIE

Who's this? 

JERRY

It's Jerry. Who's this? 

VALERIE

Uh, it's Valerie. 

JERRY

Oh, hi Valerie. What's up? 

VALERIE

I'll tell you what's up. My stepmother is violently ill, so I hit the button for poison control and I get you! 

JERRY

Wow, poison control? That's even higher than number one! 

JERRY

Hello? 

JERRY

Hang on just let me pick up a paper. 

MAN

Excuse me. Would you mind watching my bag for a minute? 

GEORGE

Yeah. No problem. 

JERRY

Let's go. 

GEORGE

Woah, I gotta watch this guy's bag. 

JERRY

For how long? 

GEORGE

I'm sure he'll be back in a second. 

JERRY

Come on. 

GEORGE

Excuse me sir. Would you mind watching my bag for a minute? 

GEORGE

Where are you going? 

JERRY

I'm going to be this guy's friend. 

JERRY

New clothes? 

GEORGE

Yeah. I did some shopping. Some new clothes shopping. (turns to a man) Can I borrow your menu? 

JERRY

Strange. For new pants, there's noticable wear on the buttocks of those chinos. Wait those are the clothes from the bag! 

GEORGE

The guy never came back. 

JERRY

He asked you to watch them not wear them. 

GEORGE

I'm still watching them. 

JERRY

You look like a tourist. 

GEORGE

All right, let me ask you something: When do you start to worry about ear hair? 

JERRY

When you hear like a soft russeling. 

GEORGE

It's like puberty that never stops. Ear puberty, nose puberty, knuckle puberty, you gotta be vigilent. Let me ask you this: Do you know where Walker Street is downtown? I've got a league meeting there. 

JERRY

Oh right, the new job, how is it? 

GEORGE

I love it. New office, new salary. I'm the new Wilhelm. 

JERRY

So who's the new you? 

GEORGE

They got a new intern from Francis Louis High. His name is Keith. He comes in Mondays after school. 

JERRY

Oh hi Alex. 

ALEX

I'm sorry I'm late. Have you ordered yet? 

JERRY

No. 

ALEX

I'll be right back. 

GEORGE

Where are you meeting these women? When they get off the bus at the port authority? 

JERRY

Right here, George. In here. (pointing to his chest) Try opening this up. You'll find the biggest dating scene in the world. 

GEORGE

Thanks. Thanks a lot. 

KRAMER

Hey. 

ELAINE

Hey. 

KRAMER

Hi. 

ELAINE

Where's Jerry? 

KRAMER

Well he's in the shower. You want me to get him? 

ELAINE

No. No no. Actually I kind of need to speak to you. 

KRAMER

Well let's sit down. 

ELAINE

Kramer, ahem, remember that whole deal with you selling Peterman your stories for his book and then he gave them back to you? 

KRAMER

Vaguely. 

ELAINE

Well I was kind of, hehehe, short on material and I, um, I put them in the book anyway. 

KRAMER

You put my life's stories in his autobiography? 

ELAINE

Kramer listen, it is such a stupid book. It doesn't matter. 

KRAMER

Oh no. Sure. It matters. Wow. I've broken through, huh. I'm part of popular culture now. Listen I've got to thank Mr. Peterman. 

ELAINE

He's doing a book signing at Waldenbooks this afternoon. 

KRAMER

Waldenbooks? That's a major chain huh. 

KRAMER

He Jerry, I'm going to waldenbooks. 

JERRY

(yelling) Get out! Get out! I don't want to live like this. 

KRAMER

All right, let's go. 

ELAINE

Mr. Lippman, how are you? 

LIPPMAN

Well I'm not bad. Not bad. 

ELAINE

What are you doing here? 

LIPPMAN

I work for Pundant Publishishing. This is our book. 

ELAINE

Oh. 

LIPPMAN

If you can call it that. Why is it every half-wit and sitcom star has his own book out now? 

KRAMER

Hey buddy. Remember me? 

PETERMAN

You're that gangly fellow we bought the stories from. 

KRAMER

Yeah, I'm just here to do my part. What's your name darling? 

KRAMER

I'm the real Peterman. 

PETERMAN

All right playtime's over. 

KRAMER

Relax man. There's enough juice here to keep us all fat and giggley. 

WOMAN

I can't believe somebody pulled the top off of this muffin. 

ELAINE

That was me. I'm sorry. I don't like the stumps. 

LIPPMAN

So you just eat the tops. 

ELAINE

Oh yeah. It's the best part. It's crunchy, it's explosive, it's where the muffin breaks free of the pan and sort of (makes hand motions) does it's own thing. I'll tell you. That's a million dollor idea right there. Just sell the tops. 

KRAMER

I have a right to be here. These are my fans. Hey you're hurting my elbow. 

ANNE

Please don't think all New Yorkers are so rude. 

GEORGE

Well actually I'm... 

ANNE

I'm Mary Anne. I work for the New York Visitor's Center. Where are you visiting from? 

GEORGE

Little Rock, Arkensas. 

ANNE

Ooh. 

JERRY

Hmm. That looks new. 

KRAMER

So get this. Peterman has his henchmen forcefully eject me from the book signing like I'm some kind of a maniac. 

JERRY

(uncomfortably) Yeah that's too bad. 

KRAMER

What's the matter with you? 

JERRY

(uncomfortably) Nothing. 

KRAMER

No, no, no. Don't give me that. I know you. Something's wrong. What is it. 

JERRY

I did something stupid. 

KRAMER

What did you do? 

JERRY

Well I was shaving. And I noticed an asymmetry in my chest hair and I was trying to even it out. Next thing I knew, (high pitched voice) Gone. 

KRAMER

Don't you know you're not supposed to poke around down there. 

JERRY

Well women do it. 

KRAMER

(high pitched voice) 'Well women do it.' I'll tell you what. I'll pick you up a sundress and a parasol and you can just (high pitched voice) sashey your pretty little self around the town square. 

JERRY

Well what am I going to tell Alex? 

KRAMER

Listen to me. You don't tell anybody about this. No one. You hear me? 

JERRY

Um hum. 

KRAMER

Hey, Jerry shaved his chest. 

JERRY

Hey! 

KRAMER

I forgot. Wait. Never mind. 

ALEX

How about the beach this weekend? 

JERRY

You couldn't pay me enough to go to the beach on a weekend. I mean it's hard enough... 

ALEX

All right. All right. Wow is that a Mexican Hairless? Oh, I love those. Ooh, Hairless. This is where it's at. It's so much smoother and cleaner. 

JERRY

Really? 

ELAINE

'Top of the Muffin to you!'? 

LIPPMAN

Top of the muffin to you. Elaine! 

ELAINE

Mr Lippman? 

JERRY

So you're pretending to be a tourist? 

GEORGE

It's beautiful. She makes all the plans. I'm not from around here so it's okay if I'm stupid, and she knows I'm only in town visiting so there's no messy breakup 

JERRY

How do you explain your apartment? 

GEORGE

I got a hotel room. 

JERRY

you moved into a hotel? 

GEORGE

Well I don't know anyone here Jerry. Where else am I going to stay? 

JERRY

So get this: we're in the park today Alex goes wild for this hairless dog. 

GEORGE

So? 

JERRY

So. I figure since she likes one hairless animal why not another. 

GEORGE

Oh really. You tell her you shaved it? 

JERRY

Are you nuts? I don't want her to think I'm one of those low-rise briefs guys who shaves his chest. 

KRAMER

(yelling up at Jerry) Hey Jerry. 

KRAMER

(yelling) I'm starting a Peterman Reality Bus Tour. Check it out. Hahaha. 

GEORGE

Reality tour? 

JERRY

The last thing this guy's qualified to give a tour of is reality. 

ELAINE

This was my idea you stole my idea. 

LIPPMAN

Elaine these ideas are all in the air. They're in the air. 

ELAINE

Well if that air is comming out of this face then it is my air and my idea. 

LIPPMAN

You want a muffin or not? 

ELAINE

Peach. 

ANNE

So I notice you don't have much of an accent. 

GEORGE

Yeah my parents have it. Sometimes it skips a generation. 

ANNE

Look george, I'm really enjoying spending time with you but I'm not sure this is going to work out. At some point you're going back to your job at Tyler Chicken and your three-legged dog Willie. 

GEORGE

Willie. Yeah. 

ANNE

And I'm still going to be here. 

GEORGE

Well what if I told you I'm thinking of moving here? 

ANNE

(laughs) George, no offense. But this city would eat you alive. 

JERRY

You're moving to New York? That's fantastic. I can see you all the time now. 

GEORGE

Eat me alive, huh? We'll see who can make it in *this* town. 

JERRY

What is it she think you can't do? 

GEORGE

Find a job. Get an apartment. 

JERRY

How did you do those things? 

GEORGE

Never mind. The're done. All I have to do now is redo them. You know if you take everything I've ever done in my entire life and condense it down into one day, it looks decent. 

JERRY

Hey, what were you doing with that bus yesterday? 

KRAMER

Here you go, here you go, check it out. 

JERRY

'The Real Peterman Reality Bus Tour'. I'm confused. 

KRAMER

Peterman's book is big business. People want to know the stories behind the stories. 

JERRY

Nobody wants to go on a three hour bus tour of a totally unknown person's life. 

KRAMER

I'm only charging $37.50, plus you get a pizza bagel and desert. 

GEORGE

What's desert? 

KRAMER

Bite-size Three Musketeers. Just like the real Peterman eats. 

GEORGE

He eats those? 

KRAMER

No. I eat those. I'm the real Peterman. 

GEORGE

I think I understand this. Jay Peterman is real. His biography is not. Now, you Kramer are real. 

KRAMER

Talk to me. 

GEORGE

But your life is Peterman's. Now the bus tour, which is real, takes to places that, while they are real, they are not real in sense that they did not *really* happen to the *real* Peterman which is you. 

KRAMER

Understand? 

JERRY

Yeah. $37.50 for a Three Musketeers. 

LIPPMAN

Elaine. I'm in over my head. Nobody likes my muffin tops. 

ELAINE

So? What do you want me to do about it? 

LIPPMAN

You're the muffin top expert, tell me what I'm doing wrong. 

ELAINE

Mr. Lippman, when I worked for you at Pendent Publishing, I believed in you, you know as a man of integrity. But, I saw you in that paper hat and that aprin... 

LIPPMAN

What if I cut you in for 30% of the profits? 

ELAINE

Deal. Here's your problem. You're making just the muffin tops. You've gotta make the *whole* muffin. Then you... Pop the top, toss the stump. Taste. 

LIPPMAN

Ah. (takes a bite of the top.) Mmmmm. Ah hah? 

ELAINE

Yeah. 

LIPPMAN

So what do we with the bottoms? 

ELAINE

I don't know, give em to a soup kitchen. 

LIPPMAN

That's a good idea. 

ELAINE

And one more thing, you really think we need the exclamation point? Because, it's not 'Top of the Muffin *TO YOU!!!*' 

LIPPMAN

No. No. It is. 

KRAMER

Hey Jerry. What is this? Lady Gillette? What's going on? 

JERRY

What? Can't I get a moment's peace? 

KRAMER

What are you doing to yourself? 

JERRY

I can't stop. Alex thinks I'm naturally hairless. 

KRAMER

You can't keep this up. Don't you know what's going to happen? Everytime you shave it, it's going to come in thicker and fuller and darker. 

JERRY

Oh that's an old wives tale. 

KRAMER

Is it? Look at this. 

KRAMER

(high pitched voice) Look at it! Look at it! And it's all me. I shaved there when I was a lifeguard. 

JERRY

Oh come on. That's genetics. That's not going to happen to me. 

KRAMER

Won't it? Or is it already starting to happen? 

ELAINE

Wow. Look at this. We're cleaning up. 

LIPPMAN

Oh, Rubin, get me another tray of lowfat cranberry. 

REBECCA

Excuse me, I'm Rebecca Demore from the homeless shelter. 

ELAINE

Oh, hi. 

REBECCA

Are you the ones leaveing the muffing pieces behind our shelter? 

ELAINE

You been enjoying them? 

REBECCA

They're just stumps. 

ELAINE

Well they're perfectly edible. 

REBECCA

Oh, so you just assume that the homeless will eat them, they'll eat anything? 

LIPPMAN

No no, we just thought... 

REBECCA

I know what you thought. They don't have homes, they don't have jobs, what do they need the top of a muffin for? They're lucky to get the stumps. 

ELAINE

If the homeless don't like them the homeless don't have to eat them. 

REBECCA

The homeless don't like them. 

ELAINE

Fine. 

REBECCA

We've never gotten so many complaints. Every two minutes, 'Where is the top of this muffin? Who ate the rest of this?' 

ELAINE

We were just trying to help. 

REBECCA

Why don't you just drop off some chicken skins and lobster shells. 

ELAINE

I think I might. 

ANNE

I can't believe you found something so quickly. How much you pay? 

GEORGE

$2300. 

ANNE

Ouch. A month? 

GEORGE

Yeah. 

ANNE

Well, guess that's all right for now, but if you say here for more than a few months, you're a real sucker. 

GEORGE

Yeah, well I uh got lots of other stuff to show you too. Wait till you see the plum job that I landed. 

ANNE

Yeah. We should let this place air out anyway. It smells like the last tenant had monkeys or something. 

KRAMER

Comming up on the right, if you glance up you can just make out my bedroom window. It's the one that's covered in chicken wire. 

WOMAN

Hey if you're the real Peterman, who come you're wearing those ratty clothes? The're not very romantic. 

KRAMER

(over the speaker) Well that's your opinion. 

KRAMER

Forget it. Okay Newman's postal route is around here somewhere. 

KRAMER

Ahh. Everyone just settle down. We have three hours left on this thing, and I can't drive and argue with you rubes all at the same time. Okay. Lomez's place of worship is right on the right here. 

JERRY

Why do I have to go on the tour? 

KRAMER

Jerry you're a minor celebrity. If you go on this thing, it could create a minor stir. Bring that girlfriend of your and I'll only charge to 60 bucks. 

JERRY

Hey, how's business? 

ELAINE

Ooh, I've got stump troubles. The Sanitation Department won't get rid of them all, I can't get a truck to haul this stuff until next week. Meanwhile, I'm sitting on a mountain of stumps. 

KRAMER

All right, I've got to hose the puke off the floor of the bus. 

ELAINE

Bus? Wait a minute, wait a minute, bus? You've got a bus? 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

ELAINE

You got any room on that thing? 

KRAMER

Yeah there are a few seats still available. 

ELAINE

Do you think you could transport some stumps for me? I'll make it worth your while. 

KRAMER

Well, if they don't mind sitting in the back. 

ELAINE

No they don't. 

KRAMER

Are they war veterans? 

ANNE

Wow this is your office. 

STEINBRENNER

Woah. Hello. Sorry George, didn't know you got a girl in here. Give me a signal on the doornob like a necktie or a sock or something. Come on George, help me out. 

ANNE

Mr. Steinbrenner, I would like to thank you for taking a chance on a hen supervisor at Tyler Chicken like our boy George here. 

STEINBRENNER

Hen supervisor from Tyler Chicken? 

GEORGE

Yes. Very nice to have had her to mention... (starting to leave) 

STEINBRENNER

Wait a minute George. 

GEORGE

Be right with you. Look Mr. Steinbrenner. 

STEINBRENNER

Moonlighting for Tyler Chicken. Pretty impressive George. Days with the New York Yankees and nights in Arkensas with a top flight bird outlet. And a hen supervisor to boot. I am blown. Bloooown away. Blown George. (vibration in the 'o''s) Bloooooooooooooooooooown. 

ALEX

You know when you make a pizza bagel, you really shouldn't use cinnimon rasin. 

JERRY

You also shouldn't use a donut. 

KRAMER

All right ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Peterman Reality Tour... 

PLAYER

Turn music off. 

JERRY

Can we just go? 

KRAMER

And go we will. 

MAN

What is this? A piece of pound cake? 

KRAMER

We have a bonus reality stop today. We will be hauling muffin stumps to the local repository. 

KRAMER

And we're off. 

JERRY

You know I never though he would be able to recreate the experience of actually knowing him, but this is pretty close. 

STEINBRENNER

(the back of his head to the camera) John Tyler? George Steinbreener here. I want to talk about George Castanza. I understand he's been dividing his time between us and you. I cannot have that. 

TYLER

(the back of his head also to the camera) Well I don't know who he is but if you want him that bad I'm not giving him up that easily. 

STEINBRENNER

Oh is that so. Playing a little hardball huh Jonnyboy? 

TYLER

How about this. You give me Castanza, I convert your concessions to all chicken no charge. Instead of hot dogs, chicken dogs. Instead of pretzels, chicken twists. Instead of beer, alcoholic chicken. 

STEINBRENNER

How do you make that alcoholic chicken? 

TYLER

Let if ferment, just like everything else. 

STEINBRENNER

That stuff sounds great. All right. I'll have Costanza on the next bus. 

MAN

Hey hey hey hey hey. Where do you think you're going? 

KRAMER

I was going to dump this. 

MAN

It doesn't look like garbage. 

KRAMER

Well it's muffin stumps 

MAN

Where are the muffin tops? 

KRAMER

This is a garbage dump. Just let me dump it. 

MAN

Can't do it. 

KRAMER

Is this a joke? 

MAN

That's what I'd like to know about it. 

ALEX

You have a pretty heavy beard, don't you? 

JERRY

What's that? 

ALEX

Well look it's almost time for you to shave again. 

JERRY

Oh. Yeah. 

KRAMER

(gets back on the bus, yelling) Well maybe I will take it up with Consumer Affairs. Ladies and Gentlemen you're in for an additional treat. We're going to extend the tour at no extra charge. 

MAN

Where are we going? 

KRAMER

(looking at a map) I don't know. (over the speaker) Uh, no more questions. 

WAITRESS

So, the New York Yankees traded you for a bunch of Tyler chicken. 

GEORGE

Dogs, twists, a kind of fermented chicken drink. 

MAN

Hey, aren't you the guy I asked to watch my clothes? 

GEORGE

What clothes? 

MAN

These clothes. The ones you're wearing. 

JERRY

(in low voice to next to Kramer) Kramer how much longer? My chest hair is comming back and it's itching me like crazy. I can't let her see me scratch it. 

KRAMER

Don't worry. I've got a good feeling about this dump. 

JERRY

I'm telling you man, I'm losing it. 

JERRY

I can't sit on this bus anymore. I think I'll go play with that dog. 

KRAMER

I don't know where the tops are. 

KRAMER

Jerry what's the matter? 

JERRY

(for the first half of the howl, a dog howls along with him.) Awoooooo-oooooooo, that feels good. 

BARTENDER

Hey, you looking for George? 

ANNE

Yeah. 

BARTENDER

He's been in the bathroom awhile. You might want to check on him. 

GEORGE

(talking on the phone) Jerry you gotta bring me some clothes down here. I lost my job with the Yankees. I'm standing in the men's room on 43rd street in my underpants. 

ANNE

I told you this city would eat you alive. 

LIPPMAN

What is this guy again? 

ELAINE

They call him a Cleaner. He makes problems go away. 

NEWMAN

Hello Elaine. Where are they? 

ELAINE

In the back. 

NEWMAN

All right, I'm going to need a clean 8 ounce glass. 

LIPPMAN

What is going on here? 

NEWMAN

If I'm curt, then I appologize. But as I understand it, we have a situation here and time is of the essence. 

JERRY

Nah, you had a good run. Took them to the World Series. 

GEORGE

I got to give the players most of the credit for that. 

JERRY

Don't sell yourself short. You made all the flight arrangements, hotels, busses. 

GEORGE

No, I don't know who was doing that. 

JERRY

So, when you actually did work, what it was that you did? 

GEORGE

They had a pastry cart you wouldn't believe. 

LANETTE

Here you go. Your latt&eacute;, your cappuccino. 

JERRY

Maybe I should ask her out? 

GEORGE

She is a good waitress. 

JERRY

That's true. Maybe I take her to the Tony's. 

GEORGE

You're going to the Tony's? 

JERRY

Yeah, I wrote some jokes to the show and they gave me two tickets. 

GEORGE

Why didn't you ask me? I know a million theater jokes. 'What's the deal with those guys down in the pit?' 

JERRY

They're musicians. That's not a joke. 

GEORGE

It's a funny observation. 

GEORGE

Severance package...The Yankees are giving me three months full pay for doing nothing. 

JERRY

They did it for three years. What's another few months. 

GEORGE

I'm really going to do something with these three months. 

JERRY

Like what? 

GEORGE

I'm gonna read a book. From beginning to end. In that order. 

JERRY

I've always wanted to do that... 

GEORGE

I'm gonna play frolf. 

JERRY

You mean golf? 

GEORGE

Frolf, frisbee golf Jerry. Golf with a frisbee. This is gonna be my time. Time to taste the fruits and let the juices drip down my chin. I proclaim this: The Summer of George! 

ELAINE

...and then Peterman ate it. I never told him. 

ELAINE

Who's that? 

DUGAN

That's Sam, the new girl in the counting. 

WALTER

What's with her arms? They just hang like salamis. 

DUGAN

She walks like orangutan. 

ELAINE

Better call the zoo. 

DUGAN

Reer... 

ELAINE

What? 

WALTER

ssssss... 

DUGAN

Cat-ty... 

ELAINE

It's like she's carrying invisible suitcases. 

JERRY

Like this? (imitates the walk) 

ELAINE

Yes, exactly. 

JERRY

That's so strange. 

ELAINE

Right. So why I'm the one who gets 'reer'. You know I mean they were being as catty as I was. It's a double standard. 

JERRY

Oh, what about 'ladies night'? Women admitted free before 10? 

ELAINE

That is so stupid. 

JERRY

Reer. 

GEORGE

Hey, 'The White Shadow' is on... 

JERRY

Boy, your really packing it all in. 

GEORGE

Jerry, my vacation just started. I need a day or two to de-compress. Besides, I did plenty today. 

JERRY

Like what? 

GEORGE

I bought a new recliner with a fridge build right in to it. 

KRAMER

Hey Jerry, you got any Tums? 

JERRY

Stomach ache? 

KRAMER

I drank too much water in the shower. 

JERRY

Aah, top of the fridge. Hey George, I'm taking that waitress to the Tony's. 

GEORGE

Shadow! 

KRAMER

Oh, the Tony's. I'll see you there buddy. 

ELAINE

You're going to the Tony's too? 

KRAMER

Roger that. 

JERRY

Where are you sitting? 

KRAMER

Well, all over the place. Yeah, I'm a seat filler. They don't like to see empty seats on TV so when somebody gets up I just park my kaboos on their spot until they get back. 

ELAINE

How did you get that job? 

KRAMER

Mickey, Mickey he hooked me up. He's a member of the academy. 

JERRY

What academy? 

KRAMER

Well, he didn't say (leaves). 

LANETTE

Hi! 

JERRY

Hi! 

LANETTE

Nice tuxedo. 

JERRY

Thanks, it's a breakaway. 

LANETTE

Should we go? 

JERRY

Absolutely. 

LANETTE

Lyle, were going! Jerry, this is Lyle. 

LYLE

Hey, how you doing? 

JERRY

Ok... 

LANETTE

Bye. 

LYLE

Have a good time. 

JERRY

Thanks, Lyle... 

KRAMER

Are you leaving? Cause I got you covered. 

KRAMER

I'll just squeeze in... 

MAN

What are you doing? 

KRAMER

My job. What are you doing? 

KRAMER

You know, if they catch two of us on TV, you got some explaining to do. 

JERRY

So, you and Lyle are roommates? 

LANETTE

No. 

JERRY

Gay? 

LANETTE

What? 

JERRY

Is he gay? 

LANETTE

No. 

JERRY

Are you sure? 

LANETTE

I think I would know. 

JERRY

(to himself) This is a new one. 

KRAMER

(to woman next to him) Pemmican turkey? Come on take a bite...well more for me. 

ANNOUNCER

...and the best musical award goes to: Scarsdale surprise! 

GEORGE

Kramer? 

GRAHAM

(on TV) Thank you and God bless you all. This has truly been a Scarsdale surprise! 

SAM

Elaine, am I crazy? I just get the feeling that Dugan and the others are making fun of me all the time. 

ELAINE

Well, You might wanna think about...maybe, eh...moving your arms a little when you walk. 

SAM

My arms? 

ELAINE

You know, sort of swing them, so your not lurching around like a caveman. 

SAM

I a caveman? 

ELAINE

No no no no, it's just... 

SAM

Everybody told what a catty shrude you are. Your horrible! 

GEORGE

She had a dude? 

JERRY

Yeah, when I went to pick her up there was this dude. 

GEORGE

How do you know it was her dude? 

JERRY

What do you think it could've been just some dude? 

GEORGE

Sure, dudes in this town are dime a dozen. 

JERRY

I reckon. 

GEORGE

Or maybe, she just wanted to go to the Tony's. I tell you what; you ask her out again. No Tony, just Jerry. That way you know it he was her dude or just some dude. 

JERRY

Dude! 

GEORGE

All right, that's enough. I gotta go home and take a nap. 

JERRY

It's 10:30 in the morning? 

GEORGE

I tell you; I'm wiped. 

JERRY

So, has the summer of George already started or are you still de-composing? 

GEORGE

De-compressing. 

KRAMER

Whooa, good morning gentleman and Tony says hello to you. 

JERRY

You didn't give that thing back? 

KRAMER

Jerry, it was a whirlwind. They whisked us backstage, the media is sworming, champagne is flowing...whooo! I can't describe how great it is to win. 

JERRY

That's because you didn't win. 

GEORGE

'Scarsdale surprise'. That's the musical about that Scarsdale diet doctor murder. 

KRAMER

Featuring the mind-blowing performance of Ms. Raquel Welch! 

JERRY

You haven't even seen it. 

KRAMER

Aah, Jerry I'm not gonna let you bring me down from this high. I've been partying all night. I saw the sunrise at Liza's! 

GEORGE

What, Minelli's!?! 

KRAMER

No. 

ELAINE

Sam, listen I'm so sorry about the other day. 

SAM

No, don't apologize Elaine. I was thinking that maybe I should swing my arms a little bit more. 

ELAINE

See, yeah, that's all I was saying. 

SAM

How's this (Sam hits a pen case out of the table), or this (swings a paper holder of the table and starts to clear the table left and right). 

ELAINE

Well, you seem to be getting a hang of it... 

JERRY

Hi! 

LANETTE

Sorry, I'm running late. I just lost track of time. 

JERRY

No rush. 

LYLE

Hey, Jerry! What's up? 

JERRY

(to himself) I have absolutely no idea. 

JERRY

..except that the dude plays the showroom and I'm stuck doing food and beveridged! 

GEORGE

Who's that? 

JERRY

It's Kramer. 

GEORGE

Hey Kramer. 

JERRY

George says hi. 

KRAMER

(shouts to the telephone) Hi George! 

GEORGE

How's that Tony? 

JERRY

Why don't you just come over? 

GEORGE

Why can't we do this on the phone? What's Kramer doing now? 

JERRY

He's looking on to fridgerator. 

GEORGE

Kramer. Anything good in there? Any Popsicles? 

JERRY

I can't do this. 

KRAMER

So, what's George doing? 

JERRY

He's not doing anything. Goodbye! 

KRAMER

So listen, I'm going to crab a bite to eat at Sardi's. You wanna go? 

JERRY

Are you taking the Tony to Sardi's? 

KRAMER

The Tony is taking me to Sardi's. 

JERRY

Oh, hello. 

KRAMER

I'm going. 

LANETTE

Congratulations! 

KRAMER

Oh, thank you, thank you so much. I have so many people I want to thank and don't want to forget anyone... 

JERRY

All right, all right. 

JERRY

I said no! (hangs up the phone.) 

LANETTE

Jerry, I just want to let you know; Lyle and I are completely over. I'd rather be with you. 

JERRY

Just me? No dudes or fellas? 

LANETTE

What you think? 

JERRY

I can start right away. 

JERRY

But not here. (They leave.) 

MACHINE

'I'm not here, leave a message.' 

GEORGE

(on the answering machine) Jerry, what's happening? Come on, pick up the phone. 

KRAMER

...so I said to him: Arthur, Artie come on, why does the salesman have to die? Change the title; The life of a salesman. That's what people want to see. 

GRAHAM

Mr. Kramer, my name is Lewis Maxton Graham. I'm one of the producers of 'Scarsdale surprise'. 

KRAMER

Hey, eh, Lew! 

GRAHAM

We need to talk. 

PETERMAN

Elaine, what did you want to talk me about? 

ELAINE

This. My office. Sam trashed my office. 

PETERMAN

Well, I see what's going on in here. I am smack dab in the middle of a good old fashioned cat fight. 

ELAINE

Mr. Petermen, this is not a cat fight. This is violent psychotic behavior directed at me all because are told her to swing her arms. 

PETERMAN

Woof! 

ELAINE

Do you mean 'reer?' 

PETERMAN

Yes, that's the one! Good day Elaine. (Leaves.) 

ELAINE

Oh, no please Mr. Peterman, she's crazy! (Sam walks by and Elaine starts to sing) Crazy for feelings... 

JERRY

I can't believe how much we did this afternoon. I have friends who this would've be their whole life. 

LANETTE

Now, what time are you picking me up tonight? 

JERRY

Eh, what? 

LANETTE

You got our reservation from Sfuzi's, didn't you? 

JERRY

Oh yeah, Sfuzi? I- I've gotta do that. 

LANETTE

Should I ware the outfit I bought today? 

JERRY

Sure. 

LANETTE

Which one? 

JERRY

The one with the...(mumbles.) 

LANETTE

If I wanna get my hair cut I've gotta go now. Call me when you get home. I wont be there, but leave a message so I know you called. 

JERRY

Ok, ok... 

LANETTE

Do you mind? 

JERRY

No, I'll crab it. 

GEORGE

Hey, I've done that today. 

JERRY

What, did you lose your remote? 

GEORGE

Nah, the cable's out. What's with you? You look dead. 

JERRY

It's Lanette! I need an assistant or intern or something. 

GEORGE

(Laughs) Relationship intern...hey, what if two of us teamed up? 

JERRY

Not. 

GEORGE

No, no... 

JERRY

No, because that's... 

GEORGE

No, listen; we are always sitting here, I am always helping you with your girl problems and you are helping me with my girl problems. Where do we end up? 

JERRY

Here. 

GEORGE

Exactly! Because neither one of us can't handle a woman all by ourselves. 

JERRY

I'm trying. 

GEORGE

I've tried. We don't have it. But maybe the two of us, working together at full capacity, could do the job of one normal man. 

JERRY

Then each of us would only have be like a half man. That sounds about right! 

GRAHAM

I'm sure how excited you are to have this very very prestigious award. But you didn't have anything to do with the actual production. 

KRAMER

No. 

GRAHAM

I don't think there's no way how we can allow you to keep this Tony. Unless... 

KRAMER

Anything... 

MALCOLM

Are you familiar with our star, Raquel Welch? 

KRAMER

Oh yeah, she's fantastic.... 

GRAHAM

She's a train wreck. 

MALCOLM

There's a big tap dance number just before Jean Harris leaves the (?) school to confront Dr Tarnover. 

GRAHAM

It is a gut wrenching scene. 

MALCOLM

But, Raquel Welch doesn't move her arms when she tap dances. It's very distracting. 

GRAHAM

There's lot of this (swings his arms) in tap dancing. 

KRAMER

So, you'd like me to teach how to dance? 

MALCOLM

No, we want you to fire her. 

JERRY

Why they want you to fire Raquel Welch? 

KRAMER

Because they're terrified of her. I heard from someone that when they cut one of her lines, she climbed up the rope on side of the stage and started dropping lights on peoples heads. Story like that has got to be true. 

JERRY

She seems very nice. 

KRAMER

Jerry, you're not in show business. You don't know what these people are like. 

JERRY

I'm in show business. 

KRAMER

Oh, come on! What am I gonna do? She's going to eat me alive. 

JERRY

I've got a tape of 'Fantastic voyage' if you think that would help. 

KRAMER

Yayaya... 

ELAINE

Jerry, that crazy straight-armed woman down at Peterman's trashed my office. And then listen to this; this is message she left me. 

VOICE

Elaine...I am going to find you. If not in your office then in the xerox room or the little conference room near to the kitchen... 

ELAINE

She must've got a blueprint of the building or something. 

JERRY

Did you tell Peterman about this? 

ELAINE

Well, I tried, but he thought it was some sort of cat fight. 

KRAMER

Cat fight? 

ELAINE

Ok, why? Why do guys do this? What is so appealing to men about a cat fight? 

KRAMER

Yeye cat fight! 

JERRY

Because men think if women are grabbing and clawing at each other there's a chance they might somehow kiss. 

KRAMER

T-t-t-t... 

JERRY

You got the tickets? 

GEORGE

Yeah, two for the 7:15 of Novaj pravas (?). What you're wearing the green sweater? 

JERRY

I like it. 

GEORGE

She doesn't like. Here is your blue one, it's her favorite. (Takes sweater out of his bag.) 

JERRY

What? 

GEORGE

Just put it on! All right now, remember she had her nails done today so remark how you like the color. And if you need me you beep me, all right. Here you go, hey, hey, hey, hey...(sprays Binaca into Jerry's mouth.) Go get'em you're a tiger! 

JERRY

Hey George, one second, she's having a party friday night and she wants me to take care of the invitations. 

GEORGE

A little notice would've helped! How many people? 

JERRY

35, and George, on the invitations... 

GEORGE

I know, I know...don't skimp. Go go go go... 

LANETTE

Right on time, I like that. 

JERRY

I like your nails, that is a great color. 

LANETTE

Love the sweater. 

JERRY

This old thing? 

GEORGE

Hi, I need some party invitations. 

CLERK

Okay, have you been in here before? 

GEORGE

About a year ago. Wedding invitations. 

CLERK

Right, how did that all work out? 

GEORGE

No complaints. 

CLERK

Well, they are arranged according the price. And as I recall...(she flips the sample book all the way to the end.) 

GEORGE

Actually, (George flips the book back to the beginning) I'll take these nice glossy ones. 

RAQUEL

'You are a fraud Dr Tarnover. You haven't even been to Scarsdale.' 

KRAMER

Ms. Welch. 

RAQUEL

Who are you? 

KRAMER

Well, I'm Cosmo Kramer, I'm one of the producers. 

RAQUEL

Hello, Sidney! No, no I told you I don't want to do that! If you bring it up again I will feed your genitals to a wolf! (hangs up) Kids! You're still here. 

KRAMER

Well, I- I Ms. Welch I do need to talk to you about a little problem regarding, eh, your performance. 

RAQUEL

What kind of problem? 

KRAMER

Well, it seems that due to the vagaries of the production parameters of this fragmenting of the audience to the cable television, carnivals, water parks... 

RAQUEL

Out with it! 

KRAMER

Well, you're fired because you don't move your arms when you tap dance, you're like a gorilla out there I've gotta go... 

GUY

Little help? 

GEORGE

Hey, frolf? 

GUY

Yeah, you know we need a fourth for the back nine. You want in? 

GEORGE

Yeah, sure. 

GUY

Ok, come on. 

JERRY

Ok, let's towel it up. 

LANETTE

Jerry, where are those invitations you were supposed to get? If they don't go out today they're useless. 

JERRY

But we're in towels. 

LANETTE

Jerry. 

JERRY

all right. One second. 

GEORGE

He frolfs, he scores...(he drops one invitation on the stairs.) 

GEORGE

Hello. 

JERRY

George, where are those invitations? You were supposed to leave them with her doorman! 

LANETTE

Did you shave your chest hair? 

JERRY

No. (Lanette leaves.) Did you at least pick them up? 

GEORGE

Yeah, the super glossy. The best they had. 

JERRY

Ok, get them over here pronto. We're in towels here George. 

GEORGE

All right, All right, keep your towel on. 

GEORGE

It's a joke. 

JERRY

All right, that's not bad. Now get over here! 

VOICE

(on the tape)...if not in your apartment then in the laundry room or the ATM in the building across the street or the watch shop! 

ELAINE

Can't you do anything about this? I mean this woman is a psycho! 

ELAINE

Look, just because I'm a woman... 

RAQUEL

I don't move my arms when I dance. That's my signature! 

ELAINE

Would you just keep an eye out for this woman. She's about ye high and eh, she doesn't swing her arms when she walks. 

ELAINE

Like this...(imitates the walk with her arms hanging.) 

RAQUEL

What the hell is that? Are you making fun of my dancing? 

ELAINE

Aren't you Raquel Welch? 

RAQUEL

You know who I am. Now, what are you doing? 

ELAINE

Nothing, I wasn't just moving my arms... 

RAQUEL

That's it, you are going down. 

KRAMER

So how's George? 

JERRY

I don't know. They don't tell me anything. What's that? (Kramer holds a broken Tony) 

KRAMER

Tony. 

JERRY

What happened to you? 

KRAMER

Raquel Welch! 

JERRY

Yikes. 

JERRY

What happened to you? 

ELAINE

Raquel Welch! 

KRAMER

The woman is a menace. 

ELAINE

Yeah, I bumped in to her on the street. It got pretty ugly. 

JERRY

Cat fight with Raquel Welch. 

KRAMER

Yey eye ca-catfight. 

ELAINE

My god, George! 

GEORGE

I slipped on the invitations...how's the towels? 

JERRY

Back on the rack. 

GEORGE

With the two of us? 

JERRY

I think we're still a man short. 

DOCTOR

Mr. Costanza. ..your legs have sustained extensive trauma. Apparently your body was in the state of advanced atrophy, due to a period of extreme inactivity. But with a lot of hard work and a little bit of luck, I think there's a good chance you may, one day, walk again. 

KRAMER

Well, that's good news. 

ELAINE

Wow, invitations again... 

KRAMER

Yeah, that's weird. 

ELAINE

All right, well...you want to grab some coffee? 

JERRY

Yeah... 

KRAMER

I'd like to get some coffee. 

GEORGE

This was supposed to be 'The summer of George'! The summer of George. 

THERAPIST

Now, swing them...swing...swing them, just swing them. 

SAM

I can't do it. It's hard! 

GEORGE

Still a little summer left. 

GEORGE

What is Holland? 

JERRY

(also wearing a moustache) What do you mean, 'what is it?' It's a country right next to Belgium. 

GEORGE

No, that's the Netherlands. 

JERRY

Holland *is* the Netherlands. 

GEORGE

Then who are the Dutch? 

JERRY

(picking at his moustache) You know I cannot stand this thing anymore. 

GEORGE

I know, I hate it too. I feel like an out of work porn star. 

JERRY

I told you, we should have taken some kind of vacation. 

GEORGE

Well why didn't we? 

JERRY

Because you said this would be better. Remember? A vacation from ourselves. That's what you said. 

GEORGE

What if we grew muttonchops? 

JERRY

No. 

GEORGE

Buzz cuts? Parachute pants! 

JERRY

Stop it, George. Stop it. I'm sorry, you've gotta get a job. 

GEORGE

(resigned) Dammit. 

GEORGE

Hey hey hey, check me out, huh? 

JERRY

No more crutches, that must be a relief. 

GEORGE

Yeah, with crutches everyone has questions. 

JERRY

Not with a cane? 

GEORGE

Nah, with crutches it's a funny story, with a cane it's a sad story. You through with those? 

JERRY

That is a sad story. Hey, you should have been here tonight. Some guy from NBC saw my set, he wants me to do a showcase. I might have another shot at a pilot. 

GEORGE

Alright, we're back in! 

JERRY

We? No. 

ANNOUNCER

(off camera) Ladies and gentlemen, Kenny Bania. 

BANIA

Thank you, thank you, (To Jerry) Hey, Jerry, did ya see me up there? I was killing, Jerry. Killing. I killed. 

JERRY

Killed? 

BANIA

Killed. (pause) I'm gonna go pick up some chicks. Good-looking ones, too! (walking away) Hey, what's your name? 

JERRY

Yeah, killed. Because I killed first and warmed up the crowd. He's like that fish that attaches himself to the shark. 

GEORGE

And you're the shark? 

JERRY

Yeah, I'm the shark and he's the fish eating my laughs. 

GEORGE

I don't know how a fish could eat laughs. 

JERRY

Well, I'm glad I brought it up. 

KRAMER

You got any shredded coconut? 

JERRY

(looking at Kramer's moustache) Uh, we're not doing that anymore. 

KRAMER

Yeah, yeah, right. (walks out) 

GEORGE

(on the phone) Oh my God. 

JERRY

What? 

GEORGE

I got a job interview. They want to see me this afternoon. 

JERRY

So what's this job? 

GEORGE

Oh, it's beautiful. It's in sports. 

JERRY

Knicks? Rangers? 

GEORGE

Playground equipment. 

JERRY

Welcome back to the show. 

GEORGE

Yeah haha. 

KRAMER

Yeah, this is better. So, you got any shredded coconut? 

JERRY

No. 

GEORGE

(holding his cane) I gotta hobble. (walks out) 

KRAMER

D-d-d-d. I gotta switch shaving creams. I'm getting no protection. 

JERRY

What kind do you use? 

KRAMER

Whatever you get. 

JERRY

(nods) Look, postcard from Elaine from Europe. 

KRAMER

Don't tell me she's dragging another poor guy across Europe. 

JERRY

Remember David Puddy? 

KRAMER

Oh, the face-painting auto mechanic. So she's dating him again, huh? 

JERRY

Well, I guess she's batted around and she's back at the top of the order. 

KRAMER

Boy, a month in Europe with Elaine. (whistles) That guy's coming home in a body bag. 

PUDDY

Well, let's see, I've got a ten kroner, a five kroner, a twenty kroner? No wait, that's another ten kroner. A fimty kroner? How much is that? 

ELAINE

We have to break up. 

PUDDY

What? 

ELAINE

I can't take this anymore! I don't want to hear how interesting the change with the hole in it is! And if you tell me what time it is in New York again, you are going home in a body bag! 

PUDDY

Well what about you? What do you think The Gap in Rome has that's not in The Gap on Broadway? 

ELAINE

Okay, alright listen. Forget about The Gap because we are through! 

PUDDY

Fine! 

ELAINE

Fine! 

DRIVER

Okay, terminal three. Have a nice flight. 

CAPTAIN

Ladies and gentlemen, our flight time, with stopovers, will be approximately 22 hours. 

ELAINE

(to flight attendant) Hey, you gonna bust out that drink cart or what? 

KRAMER

Hey, what are you doing? 

JERRY

Oh, I'm taking this lace out. It came undone and touched the floor of a men's room. That's the end of that. 

KRAMER

Did you see Bania's set last night? 'Cause I read on the Internet he killed. 

JERRY

He killed. He only does well when he has me for a lead-in. He's a time slot hit. 

KRAMER

Jerry, you gotta give him some credit. (starts rubbing a stick of Jerry's butter across his face) You're just being totally ridiculous. (keeps rubbing) I'll see you later buddy. 

JERRY

Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute. 

KRAMER

What? 

JERRY

Do I have to ask? 

KRAMER

I ran out of butter so I had to borrow yours. Anything else, Mr. Nosy? 

JERRY

Why are you buttering your face? 

KRAMER

I'm shaving with it. 

JERRY

Oh Moses smell the roses. 

KRAMER

Jerry, it's vastly superior to any commercial shaving cream. The shave is close and clean, and the natural emolients keep my skin silky-smooth. Now feel my face. 

JERRY

No. 

KRAMER

Feel it. 

JERRY

I don't want to. 

KRAMER

Feel it. Feel it. 

JERRY

(places two slices of bread against Kramer's face) That is close. 

GEORGE

I got the job? 

THOMASSOULO

George, everybody here at Play Now is very impressed with you. I, I'm sure you heard that. 

GEORGE

Well, no. 

THOMASSOULO

Now I don't want you to think that anyone's gonna treat you any differently just because of your, uh, (clears his throat) handicap. 

GEORGE

Handicap? (gesturing to his cane) Oh, I'm not handicapped. 

THOMASSOULO

I'm sorry. Differently, uh, advantaged. 

GEORGE

Yeah, I didn't mean that. 

THOMASSOULO

Of course you will have your own private, fully equipped bathroom. 

GEORGE

(shocked) When do I start? 

THOMASSOULO

Whenever you feel that you're able. (rises to show George out) Um, you need a hand here. 

GEORGE

(Thomassoulo helps George get up) Yeah, what the hell. 

JERRY

You got the job? 

GEORGE

Jerry, it's fantastic. I love the people over there. They- they treat me so great. You know they think I'm handicapped, they gave me this incredible office, a great view. 

JERRY

Hold on, they think you're handicapped? 

GEORGE

Yeah, yeah, well, because of the cane. You should see the bathroom they gave me! 

JERRY

How can you do this? 

GEORGE

Jerry, let's face it, I've always been handicapped. I'm just now getting the recognition for it. Name one thing I have that puts me in a position of advantage. Huh? There was a guy that worked at the Yankees-- no arms! He got more work done than I did, made more money, had a wife, a family, drove a better car than I did. 

JERRY

He drove a car with no arms? 

GEORGE

All right, I made up the part about the car, but the rest is true. And he hated me anyway! 

JERRY

Do you know how hard it's getting just to tell people I know you? 

GEORGE

I love that bathroom. It's got that high, high toilet. I feel like a gargoyle perched on the ledge of a building. 

KRAMER

Hey! They hooked me up. 

GEORGE

What's with all the butter? 

KRAMER

I'm shaving with it, and you know what I discovered? 

JERRY

You can eat it? 

KRAMER

No, my face feels so good, I'm gonna use it all over my body. 

JERRY

Oh my god, it's Bania and Jenna. 

GEORGE

Who? 

JERRY

The tooth brush in the toilet bowl. 

BANIA

Hey Jerry, this is Jenna. Pretty good-lookin' huh? 

JENNA

Uh, Jerry's the guy that I dated right before you. 

BANIA

Oh. This is awkward. 

JENNA

Don't worry, Kenny. After dating Jerry, you're a pleasure. 

JERRY

I don't believe this. 

GEORGE

You miss her, don't you? 

JERRY

No! He's riding my coattails again. He's getting everything off me, first laughs now ladies. 

GEORGE

You miss her. 

PUDDY

(to flight attendant) You know I think ultimately, I'm upset with myself. I knew what I was getting into, she's a bitter, unstable person. I mean the sex was good. I'm sure it was fine for her. I need more. 

ELAINE

(to another passenger) Huh. You believing this? 

PASSENGER

Excuse me, I...I was sleeping. 

ELAINE

You missed quite a performance. 

PASSENGER

(disbelieving) That's my apple juice. 

JERRY

Someone's cooking. 

NEWMAN

Hello, Jerry. 

JERRY

Hello, Newman. 

NEWMAN

You know, old friend, sometimes I ponder this silly gulf between us and I say, 'Why?' Are we really so different. For what is-- 

JERRY

(cutting in) I'm not the one doing the cooking, Newman. 

NEWMAN

Damn you Seinfeld. You useless pustule. Um, somebody's got something on the griddle. maybe it's Kramer. 

JERRY

No, he's up on the roof getting some sun with the butter (pauses) Oh no! 

NEWMAN

Butter? 

PASSENGER

(explaining the coins to Elaine) This is the fimty kroner. 

ELAINE

(to passenger) Oh? You know my last boyfriend, he had a real kroner comprehension problem. Know what I mean? A real cement head. 

WOMAN

David, you are so funny. 

PUDDY

Yeah, I know. 

ELAINE

(grabbing Puddy) What are you doing? 

PUDDY

It's a long flight, Elaine. I had to get on with my life. 

ELAINE

By making time with some floozy across the aisle? 

PUDDY

Yeah, that's right. Well, what's going on over there with you and, uh, Vegetable Lasagna? 

ELAINE

This guy? He's an idiot. he doesn't mean anything to me. 

PASSENGER

(hereon known as Vegetable Lasagna) I can hear you. 

PUDDY

Well, she doesn't mean anything to me either. If it were up to me, we'd still be together. 

ELAINE

Well maybe I feel the same way. 

PUDDY

Ok. 

ELAINE

Ok, so now what? 

PUDDY

Let's make out. 

JERRY

Kramer! 

KRAMER

Oh, man. I think I cooked myself. 

JERRY

Look at your skin. 

KRAMER

Stick a fork in me, Jerry. I'm done. 

KRAMER

I'm fried. 

JERRY

Technically, you're saut&eacute;ed. So, what are you doing for that? 

KRAMER

Well, I just gotta keep my skin moist so I don't dry out. 

JERRY

Is that what the doctor said? 

KRAMER

No, I read an article in Bon Appetit magazine. (grabs a baster) I'll see you later. 

JERRY

Yea. 

KRAMER

Hey. 

GEORGE

Hey. 

KRAMER

How you doing? (Kramer leaves) 

GEORGE

(sniffing) Hmm. Game hen? 

JERRY

Kind of. Nice limp, you're bringing your work home with you? 

GEORGE

No, I fake limp on my right. This is a real limp because I sprained my ankle. 

JERRY

What happened? 

GEORGE

Well, I was buttering myself up for a nice shave -- 

JERRY

Oh no, not you too? 

GEORGE

I must have dripped some on the floor and I slipped and... 

JERRY

You know what's good for that? Relish. 

JERRY

Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. What? No. No! No! No!! No!!! Thank you. (Hangs up.) I don't believe this. They've added Bania to the network showcase and he's going on right after me. 

GEORGE

So what, he's got a couple of good jokes. 

JERRY

Oh, like what, Ovaltine? Why do dogs drink out of the toilet? Shopping carts with one bad wheel? 

GEORGE

That's true, that always happens to me. 

JERRY

You think that's funny? 

GEORGE

I don't know, I like stuff you don't have to think about too much. 

JERRY

You like Bania's act. You're a closet Bania fan! 

GEORGE

Maybe I am. 

JERRY

Oh, I'm gonna puke. 

GEORGE

Puke! That's a funny word. Puke. (laughing) Puke! Don't have to think about that. 

ELAINE

I can't believe we broke up like that. 

PUDDY

It was stupid. 

ELAINE

Do you want something to read? 

PUDDY

No I'm good. 

ELAINE

Well, are you going to take a nap or -- 

PUDDY

No. 

ELAINE

You're just going to sit there staring at the back of a seat? 

PUDDY

Yeah. 

ELAINE

That's it! I cannot take this! I mean, look at this, nothing has changed. We've been back together two hours, we're having the same problems we had 12 hours ago. 

PUDDY

Tell me about it, I don't know why I ever took you back. 

ELAINE

Oh, please! I took you back. You know it, I know it, Vegetable Lasagna here knows it. 

LASAGNA

Please, please, I don't want to get involved. 

ELAINE

Ugh, I hope a giant mountain rises out of the ocean and we just ram right into it and end this whole thing! 

LASAGNA

Oh God. 

NEWMAN

How much longer you gonna be, I'm starving here. 

KRAMER

Just a few more squirts. Cause I gotta stay juicy. 

NEWMAN

That smell. It's still with you, huh? 

KRAMER

Yeah, it's baked on in. Hey, put another stick of butter in.  

NEWMAN

Here. 

KRAMER

Yeah, stir it up so it melts. 

KRAMER

Oh yea that feels good. Ahh, now I'm simmering. 

NEWMAN

I'll meet you at the coffee shop. 

THOMASSOULO

Good morning, George. 

GEORGE

Good morning, sir. 

THOMASSOULO

Is there something wrong with your other leg? 

GEORGE

Oh, no, that's just the old, uh, the old handicap acting up. 

THOMASSOULO

But your cane's on the wrong side. 

GEORGE

Oh well, that's, uh, that&iacute;s just because we're, uh, standing on opposite sides. 

THOMASSOULO

Huh? 

GEORGE

Yeah, see, uh, when we met, I was over there and, uh, you were over here, so the image, uh, the image was reversed, like, uh, like in the mirror. 

GEORGE

See? This looks right to you, doesn't it? 

THOMASSOULO

Uh, yeah, I guess. 

GEORGE

(passes cane from right to left and back a few times) But, see here. Right. Wrong. Right. Wrong. Right. Right. Wrong-- 

THOMASSOULO

Will you stop it, George? Just stop it! I think I can see what's going on here. 

GEORGE

Well, you're not gonna believe what happened. 

JERRY

You mugged Stephen Hawking? 

GEORGE

Play Now thinks I got problems in both legs. My own personal Rascal, Jerry. On the house. 

JERRY

Well it must be comforting to know you'll be going straight to hell at no more than three miles an hour. 

JERRY

Hello? 

ELAINE

Jerry. 

JERRY

Hey, Lainie, how's the trip going? 

ELAINE

Awful. This trip was a *huge* mistake. Huge! 

LASAGNA

Please don't shout. I can't take it. 

JERRY

Who's that? 

ELAINE

It's Vegetable Lasagna. 

JERRY

Who? 

ELAINE

Vegetable Lasagna! 

LASAGNA

My name is Magnus. 

ELAINE

Shut up or I'll snap you in half and stuff you in the overhead! 

JERRY

Get me some duty free Kahlua. 

GEORGE

How's the trip? 

JERRY

Sounded good. 

GEORGE

Well. Gotta motor. 

JERRY

Hey, if you got any juice left, you might wanna roll by the big showcase tonight. 

GEORGE

Ah, you still going on in front of Bania, eh? 

JERRY

That's right, and I'll tell you what. I'm feeling a little off. 

GEORGE

What are you talking about? (Jerry grins) You're not! 

JERRY

That's right, I'm taking a dive. 

GEORGE

You're throwing the set? 

JERRY

I'm laying down! Then we'll see how he does up there, without all the assistance. 

GEORGE

Listen Jerry. With all due respect, Bania's voice is the voice of a new generation. My generation. 

JERRY

We're four months apart. 

GEORGE

Nevertheless. His time has come. 

GEORGE

Now if you will kindly help me unwedge my front wheel, I'll be on my way. 

NEWMAN

Butter. Kramer. Butter. Kramer. 

KRAMER

Jerry, what are you doing? George tells me you're gonna throw your set? 

JERRY

That's right, Choochie. Let's see how Bania does without the cushy timeslot. 

ANNOUNCER

(OC) Ladies and gentlemen, Jerry Seinfeld! 

JERRY

If you'll excuse me. 

KRAMER

Whoa, man! 

JERRY

(OC) Hey everybody! Who's ready to laugh? 

JERRY

What's the deal with lampshades? I mean if it's a lamp, why do you want shade? 

JERRY

And what's with people getting sick? 

NEWMAN

Hee hee! Yeah yeah! 

JERRY

I mean, what's the deal with cancer? 

AUDIENCE

I have cancer! 

KRAMER

Oh, tough crowd. 

MAN

Hey, hey! You dented my ride. 

GEORGE

Whatcha got there, the 4-volt? Heh, I did you a favor. 

MAN

How about I do you a favor upside your head? 

GEORGE

Oh yeah? 

MAN

Oh yeah. 

MAN

Hey! 

WOMAN

Get the bikes. 

BANIA

Ouch. 

KRAMER

Well, that wasn't so bad, huh? 

JERRY

What are you talking about? I bombed! 

KRAMER

No, you had some good stuff. The cancer bit? I mean, it was edgy, it was not my sort of thing but some of those people out there, they really liked it. 

JERRY

Like who? 

KRAMER

Well, that guy who yelled out. 

JERRY

He *had* cancer! 

KRAMER

And laughter is the best medicine. 

JERRY

Hey, sorry Kenny. Guess you got your work cut out for you. 

ANNOUNCER

(OC) Ladies and gentlemen, Kenny Bania! 

KRAMER

Hey, Jerry, he could have used your laugh. He was a big turkey out there. 

NEWMAN

(salivating) Turkey? 

KRAMER

A big fat turkey. 

NEWMAN

I'm sorry I missed that. 

KRAMER

I tell ya, he worked so hard and then he just-- 

KRAMER

What is this, oregano? 

KRAMER

Look at me! I'm all covered in oregano and Parmesan, and it's sticking to me because of the butter! Look at me! 

NEWMAN

Here. Hold this. 

KRAMER

What is this, parsley? 

JERRY

Ah, the sweet stench of failure. 

KRAMER

Ah you bit me. Get off of me, get off of me! 

MAN

Now I got you! 

THOMASSOULO

George? Your legs! 

GEORGE

Are you a religious man, sir? 

THOMASSOULO

No. 

MAN

Eat hickory!! 

BANIA

Hey Jerry, didja see it? 

JERRY

Ouch. 

STU

Kenny! There you are. Jay Shermak and Stu Crespi from NBC. Listen, Kenny. Really funny out there. 

JERRY

What? 

JAY

That thing you did having the two guys running through? I love stuff you don't have to think too much about. 

STU

Give us a call. We want to be in the Kenny Bania business. 

JAY

By the way, Jerry? The suspenders? A little hacky. 

BANIA

How about that Jerry? First you had a pilot on NBC and now I'll have one. Looks like I'm following you again. 

JERRY

Oh, I'm gonna puke. 

BANIA

Puke? That's a funny word. Can I use that? 

ELAINE

David, this has been the worst month of my life and if I never see you again it'll be too soon. 

PUDDY

Ditto. 

ELAINE

Oh that's origi- 

PUDDY

Go to Hell. 

ELAINE

86th and Broadway please. 

DRIVER

I'm sorry lady, there's a cab shortage. The Transit Police are making everybody share. 

ELAINE

Oh no. 

LASAGNA

Hello! (sees Elaine) Oh no. I'm sorry. 

ELAINE

Noooooooooooo! 

THOMASSOULO

George, you're not really handicapped, are you? 

GEORGE

I've had my difficulties. 

THOMASSOULO

I saw you running down Amsterdam Avenue lifting that 200 pound motorized cart with one hand. 

GEORGE

Mr. Thomassoulo during times of great stress, people are capable of super human strength. Have you ever seen the Incredible Hulk, sir? 

THOMASSOULO

No 

GEORGE

How about the old Spider Man live action show? 

THOMASSOULO

George, I've realized we've signed a one-year contract with you, but at this point I think it's best that we both go our separate ways. 

GEORGE

I don't understand. 

THOMASSOULO

We don't like you. We want you to leave. 

GEORGE

Clearer 

JERRY

So you're staying at Play Now? 

GEORGE

Why not? Pay is good. I got dental, private access to one of the great handicapped toilets in the city. 

JERRY

But they not you aren't handicapped, aren't you ashamed? 

GEORGE

They're the ones who should be ashamed. They signed me to a one-year contract. As long as I show up for work every day, they have to pay me. 

ELAINE

Hey 

GEORGE

(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o! 

GEORGE

Hello-o-o-o Elaine! 

ELAINE

What's that? 

JERRY

Oh, it's just this stupid thing. 

ELAINE

Well, I'm sure it's stupid. It's not about me, is it? 

JERRY

(doing the voice) No-o-o-o. 

GEORGE

(doing the voice) Not at all. 

ELAINE

Tell me! 

JERRY

All right. You know this girl Clare I am seeing? 

ELAINE

Yeah. 

JERRY

Well, he and I starting joking that when she falls asleep her stomach stays awake all night and talks to me. 

ELAINE

How is it talking? 

JERRY

Well, her belly button is like a mouth. (doing the voice) I'm bored. Talk to me. 

ELAINE

Oh I gotta start taking these 'stupid' warnings more seriously. 

JERRY

Hey, look whose here - Puddy. 

ELAINE

My Puddy? But we broke up. 

JERRY

And yet he continues to live. 

PUDDY

Hey Benes, How are you? 

ELAINE

I'm doing great. 

PUDDY

Great. (pauses) See ya. 

JERRY

Well, that's it. You two are back together. 

ELAINE

What? 

JERRY

The bump into. The bump into always leads to the backslide. 

ELAINE

David and I will not be getting back together. 

JERRY

Elaine, breaking up is like knocking over a coke machine. You can't do it in one push, you got to rock it back and forth a few times, and then it goes over. 

GEORGE

That's beautiful. 

ELAINE

What about you? You were even engaged, and you cut it off just like that. 

JERRY

That's different. I didn't have feelings for those people. But you, you'll backslide 

ELAINE

You want to bet? 

JERRY

Stakes? 

ELAINE

50 

JERRY

Dollars? 

ELAINE

All right. Witness? (looks at George). 

GEORGE

Witness. 

JERRY

Done. 

GEORGE

Percentage? 

ELAINE

No. 

CLARE

So I'll call you tonight? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

CLARE

What's wrong with the belt? 

JERRY

I went to the movies last night, I went to the bathroom and I unbuckled a little wobbly and the buckle kind of banged against the side of the urinal. So...(throws away belt) that's it! 

CLARE

So, you're insane? 

JERRY

Oh yes, quite. 

KRAMER

Hello! 

JERRY

Of course it's a sliding scale. 

CLARE

Catch you later. 

JERRY

(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o! (haha) 

JERRY

(doing the voice) La la la. 

KRAMER

(doing the voice) La la la. 

KRAMER

Look at this, they are redoing the Cloud Club. 

JERRY

Oh, that restaurant on top of the Chrysler building? Yeah, that's a good idea. 

KRAMER

Of course it's a good idea, it's my idea. I conceived this whole project two years ago. 

JERRY

Which part? The renovating the restaurant you don't own part or spending the two hundred million you don't have part? 

KRAMER

You see I come up with these things, I know they're gold, but nothing happens. You know why? 

JERRY

No resources, no skill, no talent, no ability, no brains. 

KRAMER

(interrupts) No, no...time! It's all this meaningless time. Laundry, grocery, shopping, coming in here talking to you. Do you have any idea how much time I waste in this apartment? 

JERRY

I can ball park it. 

ELAINE

(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o! 

KRAMER

Here we go; now she comes in. Now my whole day is shot! 

JERRY

Hey, I called you last night, where were you? 

ELAINE

(looking VERY guilty) I went out with a (fake cough) a friend. 

JERRY

George? 

ELAINE

(looking guiltier) No, no...no. 

JERRY

Well, I was here, that's everyone (laughing). 

ELAINE

(laughing). 

JERRY

Are those the same shoes as yesterday? 

ELAINE

Oh, you know I wear these shoes all the time. 

JERRY

Your hair, it's somewhat de-poofed. 

ELAINE

It's the new look. You know Heroin Cheek? 

JERRY

Wait a second, what's going on here? 

ELAINE

Nothing, nothing. 

JERRY

(screams). 

ELAINE

(screams). 

JERRY

You're wearing the same clothes as yesterday!!! (pauses) You saw Puddy! 

KRAMER

Hoochie moochie. (haha) 

JERRY

Hand it over. Pay up. 

ELAINE

No! It's an isolated, sexual incident. We are not back together! 

JERRY

Then what do you call it? People don't just bump into each other and have sex. This isn't cinemax. 

ELAINE

It was no big deal OK? I mean we fooled around, then we went out and grabbed a little dinner. 

JERRY

Ah, dinner! That's it, you're all the way back! 

ELAINE

Ugh! 

JERRY

Sex, that's meaningless, I can understand that, but dinner; that's heavy. That's like an hour. 

KRAMER

(still reading the paper) Man, 2.9 percent financing on a Toyota Onedun (Sp?). That was my idea too! 

GEORGE

Good Morning! 

WORKER

Go to hell! 

GEORGE

Hi Allison, that's a nice dress. 

ALLISON

Don't even look at me. 

GEORGE

Hey Glenn! 

GLENN

Hey, go tell hell! 

GEORGE

Heard that one already. 

KRAMER

...So that's the bedroom. Here's the bathroom. If you need to, you can familiarize yourself with the kitchen...Yeah, go ahead and look through some of the drawers. 

JERRY

And you are? 

DARREN

Oh, hey, I'm Darren. I'm new here. 

KRAMER

Yeah, that's Jerry, you don't have to worry about him. Why don't you go across the hall and get started on that mail. 

DARREN

Right! 

KRAMER

He's a go getter! 

JERRY

Who's he? 

KRAMER

My intern from NYU. Well, you remember my corporation, Kramerica Industries. 

JERRY

Alright. 

KRAMER

Well, apparently NYU is very enthusiastic about their students getting some real world corporate experience. 

JERRY

But you only provide fantasy world corporate experience. 

KRAMER

Well, this will really free up my time so I can focus on more important things, like my bladder system. 

JERRY

Alright, it's time to go. 

KRAMER

Jerry, it's not for people, it's for oil tankers. 

JERRY

(sarcastically) I know! 

KRAMER

You see the idea is for a rubber ball inside the tanker so if it crashes, the oil won't spill out. 

JERRY

Actually, that is not a bad idea. 

KRAMER

(smiles) yeah. 

JERRY

Now, it's time to go. 

JERRY

Hello 

GEORGE

(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o. (He's sitting on the floor in his Play Now office). 

JERRY

(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o. (pauses) So, what's going on? 

GEORGE

Siege mentality, Jerry. They really want me out of here. They've downgraded me to some sort of a bunker. I'm like Hitler's last days here. 

JERRY

So, are you going to leave? 

GEORGE

Oh no! I'm vigilant. They'll never get me out. I'm like a weed, Jerry. 

JERRY

I thought you're like Hitler in the bunker? 

GEORGE

I'm a weed in Hitler's bunker. 

JERRY

I'm getting a little uncomfortable with the Hitler stuff. (his other line beeps) I'm getting another call, see ya...(answers call) Hello! 

DARREN

Hi, this is Darren from Kramer's office. Mr. Kramer would like to schedule a lunch with you at Monk's coffee shop. 

JERRY

(looking shocked) Really? When? 

DARREN

In 10 minutes. Do you need directions? 

JERRY

No, I don't. 

DARREN

Well, I'll call back in 5 minutes to confirm. 

KRAMER

Yeah, 5. 

ELAINE

Hey! 

JERRY

Hey! So, where's my money? 

ELAINE

No money, I am Puddy free. So, are we eating or what? 

JERRY

Oh yeah, hold on. 

JERRY

Hello Darren, this is Jerry from Jerry's office. (Elaine is looking confused). We're going to be three for lunch. (Elaine is still looking confused) What do you mean he's already left? 

JERRY

Hey, Elaine is going to come with us, alright? 

KRAMER

What? When did this happen? 

JERRY

Well, just... 

KRAMER

(yelling) DARREN! 

ELAINE

I am not calling Puddy. What did I do with my gloves? Oh, I bet I left them over at Puddy's. I should call him. I need those gloves. No, I better not. I'll call. (looks at table) Oh, look at that! There are the gloves. I was just about to call. There they are. That's funny. That's really funny. That's really really funny. You know who loves funny stories, David Puddy. (Picks up phone). 

GEORGE

Well, Play Now is through playing. They turned the heat way up in my office. They tried to sweat me out. 

JERRY

Do you have to write all this stuff down. 

DARREN

Well, Mr. Kramer is in a meeting with Mr. Lohmase and he didn't want to miss anything. 

JERRY

So, how hot did it get? 

GEORGE

I don't know, 120, 130...Then they sent some guys to sandblast for 6 hours. Tomorrow they are putting in asbestos. 

JERRY

I guess you can take anything, but actual work. 

GEORGE

Bring it on! 

GEORGE

(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o Kramer! 

JERRY

(doing the voice) Wel-l-l-c-o-m-e! 

GEORGE

(doing the voice) La la la. 

KRAMER

Sorry I couldn't get out of there, what did I miss? (asking his 'intern') 

DARREN

Well, after ordering, Mr. Seinfeld and Mr. Costanza debated on whether or not iron man wore some sort under garment between his skin and his iron suit... 

KRAMER

Uh huh... 

GEORGE

(Interrupts) And I still say he's naked under there! 

JERRY

Oh that makes a lot of sense. 

GEORGE

Oh, shut up! 

DARREN

...Then Mr. Seinfeld went to the restroom, at which point Mr. Costanza scooped ice out of Mr. Seinfeld's drink with his bare hands using it to wash up (Jerry is taking a sip of water and looking mad) then Mr. Costanza remarked to me, 'This never happened.' (Jerry then spits out the water). 

JERRY

(giggling) 

CLARE

What's so funny? 

JERRY

Oh, nothing. (still giggling) 

CLARE

What are you laughing about? Tell me. 

JERRY

Oh all right, this is really dumb, really stupid. We've been doing this silly, dumb voice. 

CLARE

So is it fun humiliating me? 

JERRY

No, it's not you. It's your stomach, he's taking with this funny, booming, jovial voice. (doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o. 

CLARE

So you think I'm fat? 

JERRY

No it's... 

DARREN

Mr. Kramer says, 'hey buddy!' 

JERRY

Hey, we're kind of in the middle of something here. Would you mind coming back later? 

DARREN

Oh yeah sure, sure. Should we set something up now? 

JERRY

(Screams) GET OUT! 

CLARE

I'm leaving too. 

JERRY

No body said you're fat. He's a loving character, like the Kool-ade guy. 

CLARE

He is fat! 

JERRY

No, he's just a little bloated. 

CLARE

Good-bye! 

JERRY

It's mostly water weight. 

KRAMER

Boysenberry, the kid is still learning. 

DARREN

Mr. Kramer...Dean, my internship is on line two, she wants to set up a meeting. 

KRAMER

Yeah, well nothing before noon. 

JERRY

Line two? 

KRAMER

Yeah, your phone is line one. 

JERRY

Oh... 

PUDDY

So the gloves were right by the phone. That is pretty funny. 

ELAINE

See, this is what Jerry's doesn't understand. We can see each other. We can see each other every day, but it doesn't mean we are back together. 

PUDDY

I mean I love just seeing you and having sex. 

ELAINE

Yeah. 

PUDDY

Not having to do all that...you know...work. 

ELAINE

Well, either way... 

PUDDY

All that calling you, and buying you stuff... 

ELAINE

David... 

PUDDY

Caring about how everyone at work isn't as smart as you. It's brutal. 

ELAINE

Alright that's it! We're back together! 

PUDDY

Oh, no. 

ELAINE

Oh, yeah. 

PUDDY

Look Elaine, be reasonable. 

ELAINE

Get those clothes off. You're going to spend the night and we're going to cuddle. 

PUDDY

What? 

ELAINE

You heard me. Strip! 

GEORGE

(whistling)....(laughing)....Alright......OK.... 

GEORGE

(on phone ' calling secretary) Hello Margery, George Costanza. How are you sweet heart? Listen, can you give Mr. Thomassoulo a message for me? ...Yes. If he needs me, tell him (screams) I'M IN MY OFFICE! Thanks. 

KRAMER

Dean Jones, you wanting to talk to me? 

JONES

I've been reviewing Darren's internship journal. Doing laundry... 

KRAMER

...Yeah. 

JONES

...Mending chicken wire, hi-tea with a Mr. Newman. 

KRAMER

I know it sounds pretty glamorous, but it's business as usual at Kramerica. 

JONES

As far as I can tell your entire enterprise is more than a solitary man with a messy apartment which may or may not contain a chicken. 

KRAMER

And with Darren's help, we'll get that chicken. 

JONES

I'm sorry, but we can't allow Darren to continue working with you. 

KRAMER

Well, I have to say this seems capricious and arbitrary. 

JONES

You fly is open. 

JERRY

So you're sure you're not still angry about last night? 

CLARE

No, I'm fine. Just as long as you don't ever do that voice again. 

JERRY

Never? 

CLARE

Never. 

JERRY

What about if you're not around? 

CLARE

No! 

JERRY

So I have to choose between seeing you and doing the voice? 

CLARE

That's right. 

JERRY

I can do that. 

CLARE

So what's your decision? 

JERRY

I don't know. 

CLARE

Jerry...HI. 

JERRY

(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o. La-la-la. (haha) 

GEORGE

You broke up with her? Why? 

JERRY

So we could do the voice. (doing the voice) La-la-la. What's the matter? 

GEORGE

I think I'm getting tired of it. I mean is that all it does? Hello? La-la-la? 

JERRY

No, it can do anything. It can be Spanish. (doing the voice) Hola. Hello-o-o-o. 

GEORGE

I think I like the girl better than the voice. 

JERRY

Really? 

JERRY

(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o. 

ELAINE

Still? 

GEORGE

I told you. 

ELAINE

Alright, here you go, choke on it (hands him money). 

JERRY

See, never bet against the backslide. I knew you two would get back together. 

ELAINE

Yeah, well not for long. I'm breaking up with him. 

JERRY

No, I don't think so. I've seen you two together. You make each other miserable. It's kismet. 

ELAINE

Double or nothing. 

JERRY

Done. 

GEORGE

(talking from bathroom) Witness? 

JERRY

You're in there again. 

GEORGE

I think Play Now is putting something in my food. 

ELAINE

Alright, I'm out of here. 

JERRY

What is this? (Kramer is wearing jeans that look like it doesn't fit him). 

KRAMER

I don't know. I found them in your closet. Ever since Darren left I haven't been able to find anything. He took all my clothes to some cleaners. I'm clueless. (looks at clock) Is that clock right? 

JERRY

Yeah. Nine o'clock. 

KRAMER

I was supposed to pick up Newman at the zoo twelve hours ago. 

JERRY

(doing the voice) Good-bye Kramer. 

KRAMER

Jerry, buddy, I got to tell you something. That voice is played. 

JERRY

Really? 

KRAMER

So played. 

GEORGE

I told you. 

KRAMER

Darren? What are you doing here? The college canceled the internship. 

DARREN

I don't care about the internship. I care about Kramerica. 

KRAMER

Kramerica is no more. 

DARREN

What about the oil tanker bladder system? We were going to put an end to maritime oil spills. 

KRAMER

Probably. Darren, you go home. Forget about Kramerica. 

KRAMER

Well, you're still here? 

DARREN

I haven't had time to leave. 

KRAMER

Well, I haven't changed my mind. 

KRAMER

Well, you are a tenacious little monkey. Alright, I'll do it. Kramerica industries lives! Let's get back to work! 

KRAMER

Let's see what Jerry has to eat. 

THOMASSOULO

You win George. We've had it. If you leave right now, Play Now will give you six months pay. That's half of your entire contract. Please...just go. 

GEORGE

You see if I stay the whole year, I get it all. 

THOMASSOULO

Want to play hand ball huh? Fine. (calls on intercom) Attention Play Now employees, George Costanza's handicapped bathroom is now open on the sixteenth floor to all employees and their families. 

GEORGE

Well played. 

THOMASSOULO

I'll see you in hell Costanza. 

JERRY

(on the phone with Clare) Clare thanks for giving me a second chance. Our relationship is certainly worth more than some silly, stupid voice. Hold on one second. (George walks in ' Jerry asks George) So we definitely don't want to do the voice anymore? (George shakes his head NO) Alright, we're back together again, great. Bye bye. 

KRAMER

Hey. 

JERRY

Trouble down at the plant? 

KRAMER

It's a tank of oil. Darren and I are finally going to test out my bladder system. 

GEORGE

You have to drink that whole thing? 

KRAMER

No. No. No. It's for oil tankers. All I need to do is fill some sort of rubber container with oil and then drop it to see whether or not it can restrain the impact. 

JERRY

I understand (not really understanding, lol). 

GEORGE

Would a giant rubber ball work? 

KRAMER

Conceivably. 

GEORGE

Well, Play Now has all kinds of different rubber balls. Why don't we test your bladder system at my office? 

JERRY

You're not... 

GEORGE

Oh, yes I am. Mr. Thomassoulo likes to play dirty. Well, there's nothing dirtier than a giant ball of oil. 

PUDDY

Hey, you want to split a root beer (I think that's what he says)? 

ELAINE

I don't think so David, we're through. 

PUDDY

Oh...That's a nice sweater (Elaine smiles). 

ELAINE

Whew that was a dozy. 

JERRY

Go again? 

ELAINE

Book it. 

GEORGE

(again from bathroom) Witness. 

ELAINE

David I know this hurts, but it's the way it has to be (Puddy is giving her a look like he's going to still get some). 

JERRY

Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha ha. 

ELAINE

I'm going to get some popcorn. 

ELAINE

So, how did it end? 

JERRY

They got away. 

ELAINE

uh. 

ELAINE

Listen David, I've got to run. Can you lend me fifty bucks? 

JERRY

Hey. 

KRAMER

Did you bring the video camera? 

JERRY

Yeah, I put a six hour tape in. That should cover the experiment, the arrest, and most of your trial. Alright, I'll see ya. 

GEORGE

Oh, you might want to stick around Jerry. Mr. Thomassoulo picked the wrong man to hire because he was fake handicapped. 

JERRY

I can't. I got to meet Clare. 

KRAMER

You gave up the voice? 

JERRY

Yeah, I thought it was stupid. Unless you guys are liking it again. 

GEORGE

No. No 

JERRY

Darren? 

DARREN

Sorry Mr. Seinfeld. 

JERRY

Uh, bathroom. 

GEORGE

Hey, use mine. I'll let you in. 

JERRY

I thought it was open to the public. 

GEORGE

I uh, took care of that. 

JERRY

Wow! Zanadu . No wonder you're putting in so many hours. (looks at urinal) May I? 

GEORGE

I insist. I'll fix us a drink. (phone rings ' who would that be?) I got it. 

KRAMER

Whew. You know Darren, if you would have told me twenty-five years ago that some day I'd be standing here about to solve the worlds energy problems, I would've said you're crazy... Now let's push this giant ball of oil out the window. 

GEORGE

So, check out my view. 

JERRY

Wow! Hey, there's Clare. I better go down. 

GEORGE

Hey, there's Kramer & Darren. 

JERRY

There's the giant ball of oil. Clare's right underneath that thing. Clare! Hello-o-o-o! Hello-o-o-o! Hello-o-o-o! 

CLARE

I don't believe this. I am not looking up if you're going to do that voice. 

KRAMER

Bombs away (Uh oh). 

JERRY

This is going to be a shame. 

GEORGE

Hello. 

KRAMER

Well, that didn't work. Hey, how about this...ketchup and mustard in the same bottle? 

DARREN

Oh that sounds interesting sir. 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

JERRY

Clare won her lawsuit against Play Now. Gee, Play Now is filing for bankruptcy. I guess you're not going in anymore. 

GEORGE

Yeah. 

JERRY

So they're not paying you your... 

GEORGE

No. 

JERRY

So you're pretty much... 

GEORGE

Yeah. 

JERRY

What ever happened to Darren? 

KRAMER

Darren is going away for a long long time. 

JERRY

So Clare sure looked real funny covered in oil like that... (doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o I got beamed with a giant ball of oil... 

GEORGE

(doing the voice) I'm slippery as an eel... 

KRAMER

(doing the voice) La la la. 

JERRY

I'm just so glad it's back. 

ELAINE

See, this is good. This is the way it should be. You know why are we fooling ourselves. We belong together. 

PUDDY

ELAINE: I want to break up. 

ELAINE

Ah nuts! 

FRANK

I got no leg room back here. Move your seat forward. 

ESTELLE

That's as far as it goes. 

FRANK

There's a mechanism. You just pull it, and throw your body weight. 

ESTELLE

I pulled it. It doesn't go. 

FRANK

If you want the leg room, say you want the leg room! Don't blame the mechanism! 

GEORGE

All right, Dad, we're five blocks from the house. Sit sideways. 

FRANK

Like an animal. Because of her, I have to sit here like an animal! Serenity now! Serenity now! 

GEORGE

What is that? 

FRANK

Doctor gave me a relaxation cassette. When my blood pressure gets too high, the man on the tape tells me to say, 'Serenity now!' 

GEORGE

Are you supposed to yell it? 

FRANK

The man on the tape wasn't specific. 

GEORGE

What happened to the screen door? It blew off again? 

ESTELLE

I told you to fix that thing. 

FRANK

Serenity nowww! 

PATTY

So I told Bobby and Lisa that we'd try the new Chinese Spanish 

JERRY

Oh, I thought we had tickets for the Knicks home opener. 

PATTY

Well I thought this would be more fun so I gave the tickets away. 

JERRY

What? All right, fine. 

PATTY

Are you mad at me? 

JERRY

No, I love a good Chinese Spanish whatever it is. 

PATTY

You know... I've never seen you mad. 

JERRY

I get peeved. 

PATTY

Mad. 

JERRY

Miffed. 

PATTY

*Mad*. 

JERRY

Irked? 

PATTY

I'd like to see you get *really* mad. 

GEORGE

Why does she want you to be mad? 

JERRY

She says I suppress my emotions. 

GEORGE

So what do you care what she thinks. 

JERRY

Good body. 

GEORGE

She probably gets that impression because you're cool. You're under control. Like me. Nothing wrong with that. 

JERRY

But I get upset, I've yelled. You've heard me yell. 

GEORGE

Not really. Your voice kind of raises to this comedic pitch. (Kramer enters) 

KRAMER

Hey. 

JERRY

Kramer, I am so sick of you comin' in here and eatin' all my food. Now shut that door and get the hell out of here! 

KRAMER

(Laughing) What is that, a new bit? 

GEORGE

I told ya. Hey, any of you guys want to come out and help me fix my father's screen door in Queens? 

JERRY

Sorry, I'm fixing a screen door in the Bronx. 

KRAMER

I'll do it. 

GEORGE

Really? You wanna come? 

KRAMER

Yeah, I love going to the country. 

ELAINE

Where are they goin'? 

JERRY

Fix a screen door in Queens. 

ELAINE

(Laughing) That's funny. Hey, listen, what are you doin' Saturday night? 

JERRY

Not goin' to the Knick game. 

ELAINE

I need someone to go with me to Mr. Lippman's son's Bar Mitzvah. 

JERRY

You know, if you don't bring a guest they save a catering. You should be able to buy a cheaper gift. 

ELAINE

(Taking out Boggle) Oh, I don't think that's possible. 

KRAMER

(Holding camera) Get in a little closer. I can't see the screen door. (Takes picture) Perfect. 

GEORGE

Dad, the hinges are all rusted here. That's why the wind keeps blowing the door off. 

ESTELLE

I hate that old door. Throw it out! 

FRANK

Serenity now! 

KRAMER

It might be time to just let her go, Frank. She's worked hard for ya. 

FRANK

Will you put her to rest for me? 

KRAMER

Oh yeah, I'll take good care of her. (Rips out the screen door) &nbsp; 

ESTELLE

(From other room) Get George to put those boxes in the garage. 

GEORGE

Dad, what's all this? 

ESTELLE

(From other room) It's junk. 

FRANK

My computers. I've been selling them for two months now. Shut up! 

GEORGE

You're selling computers? 

FRANK

Two months ago, I saw a provocative movie on cable TV. It was called The Net, with that girl from the bus. I did a little reading, and I realize, it wasn't that farfetched. 

GEORGE

Dad, you know what it takes to compete with Microsoft and IBM? 

FRANK

Yes, I do. That's why I got a secret weapon... my son. 

JERRY

Damn it, they gave me cream! I asked for nonfat milk! 

PATTY

I think they have 1% over there. 

JERRY

1%?! They can kiss 1% of my ass! 

PATTY

OK, Jerry, enough. I'm not buying it. 

JERRY

You're damn right you're not buying it! 

PATTY

You shouldn't have to try. It's just being open. 

JERRY

I'm open. There's just nothing in there. 

PATTY

Sarcastically) Uh huh. 

JERRY

Oh, you think I'm lying about this? 

PATTY

I think you are. 

JERRY

Well, I'm not. 

PATTY

Yes, you are, liar. 

JERRY

Oh, stop it. 

PATTY

OK, liar. 

JERRY

That's enough! 

PATTY

Ooh, that was good. 

JERRY

Really? It felt good. 

ELAINE

Congratulations, Mr. Lippman. 

LIPPMAN

Oh, Elaine. My boy's a man today. Can you believe it? He's a man. 

ELAINE

Oh, congratulations, Adam. (Adam zealously French-kisses Elaine) 

ADAM

I'm a man! 

JERRY

Tongue? 

ELAINE

Yeah. 

GEORGE

Wow! I didn't try that 'til I was 23. 

JERRY

Well this kid's not just a man. He's a man's man. 

ELAINE

And I think he's been telling his friends. I got invitations to six more Bar Mitzvahs. (phone rings) 

JERRY

Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. No, no, no, I do not want to stop over in Cincinnati. Well, then you upgrade me. That's right, you should thank me. Goodbye. (Hangs up) Hey, I'm flyin' first class. 

ELAINE

Where did that come from? 

JERRY

Patty showed me how to get mad. You gotta problem with that? 

ELAINE

No. 

JERRY

Good. 

GEORGE

All right, relax, tough guy. I got to go out to my father's garage, help him sell some computers. 

JERRY

What? The two of you workin' in that garage is like a steel cage death match. 

GEORGE

Kramer. 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

GEORGE

What-what are you doing? 

KRAMER

Oh, I'm putting up Frank's screen door. This beauty's got a little life in her yet. 

JERRY

What do you need it for? 

KRAMER

(Closing door) The cool evening breezes of Anytown, USA. Let's see how this baby closes. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. 

GEORGE

Morning, ma. 

ESTELLE

(From another room ) You're late! 

GEORGE

Morning, dad. 

FRANK

I'm not 'dad' in the workplace. My professional name is Mr. Costanza, and I will refer to you as 'Costanza'. Morning, Braun. 

LLOYD

(Handing Frank coffee) Morning, George. Two cream, no sugar. 

GEORGE

What is Lloyd Braun doing here? 

FRANK

Your mother recommended him. 

GEORGE

Yeah, of course she did. That's all I ever heard growing up is 'Why can't you be more like Lloyd Braun?' Did you know he was in a mental institution? 

FRANK

I didn't read his resume. 

LLOYD

(Ringing the sale bell) Another sale, Mr. Costanza. Chalk me up on the big board. 

GEORGE

(Inquiring about the chalk board) What is this? 

FRANK

(Drawing a zero under George's name) This is your lagging. Good work, Braun. 

ESTELLE

(From another room) Good for you, Lloyd! 

ELAINE

So Adam, I just talked to your father, and, apology accepted. 

ADAM

I'm not apologizing. It was great. I told everyone. 

ELAINE

Yeah, I know. Uh, by the way, could you do me a favor and tell Mitchell Tanenbaum that I will be unable to attend this Saturday. 

ADAM

Are you free Friday night? 

ELAINE

I am, but that is not the point. You are thirteen, and I am in my early... 20s. 

ADAM

But I'm a man. The rabbi said so. 

ELAINE

No. You are not a man. It takes a *long* time to become a man. I mean, half my friends aren't even there yet. 

ADAM

Well, if I'm not a man, then this whole thing was a sham! First, they said I was gonna get great gifts, and then, somebody gives me Boggle. I renounce my religion! 

LIPPMAN

Who wants cookies? 

ADAM

As of this moment, I am no longer Jewish. I quit! 

LIPPMAN

What? 

ELAINE

(Eating) Walnuts, mmmmmm. &nbsp; 

FRANK

You're late again, Costanza, so listen up. Starting tonight, we're having a little sales contest. The loser gets fired, the winner gets a Waterpik. 

ESTELLE

(From another room) You're not giving away our Waterpik! 

FRANK

Serenity now! 

GEORGE

You know what? It doesn't matter, because I quit! 

FRANK

I guess your mother was right. You never could compete with Lloyd Braun! (Lloyd rings his sale bell and smiles) 

GEORGE

You wanna sell computers? I will show *you* how to sell computers! Hello, Mr. Farneman. You wanna buy a computer? No? Why not? All right, I see! Good answer! Thank you! (Lloyd rings his sale bell) Serenity now! 

ELAINE

Adam, you don't become a man overnight. Look at your father. It takes time. Patience, experience. Uh, several careers of varying success. And these are things I look for in a man. 

ADAM

(Storming out of the room) Well, that does me a lot of good. 'Early 20s'! 

ELAINE

Well, I'm sorry, sir, I tried. 

LIPPMAN

So, that's the type of guy you're looking for? 

ELAINE

Uhh. I guess so. Why? (Mr. Lippman vigorously starts making out with her) 

PATTY

(Surveying Kramer's hall patio ) What is this? 

JERRY

(Knocking on Kramer's door) Anytown, U.S.A. Hello? Is Kramer home? Oh, hey. 

KRAMER

(Spraying his flowers) Hello, neighbor. 

JERRY

Boy, those azaleas are really coming in nicely. 

KRAMER

Oh, you gotta mulch. You've got to. 

JERRY

You barbecuing tonight? 

KRAMER

(Ringing his wind chimes) Right after the fireworks. 

JERRY

So, where do you want to eat tonight? 

PATTY

How about La Caridad again? 

JERRY

Again!? How much flan can a person eat!? 

PATTY

Jerry, you've been yelling at me all afternoon. 

JERRY

Well, I don't think more flan is the answer! 

PATTY

Maybe I should just leave. 

JERRY

'Maybe'!? 

PATTY

Good-bye! 

JERRY

Double good-bye! (As Patty leaves, open door reveals Kramer, sitting on his lawn chair with a sparkler) 

KRAMER

Hey, buddy! 

ELAINE

(Coming in Jerry's apartment) Hey. Happy New Year! 

KRAMER

(Getting the door slammed on him) Y'all come back reeeaall... 

ELAINE

Did you and Patty just break up? 

JERRY

Yeah! In fact, she broke up with me! And I don't want to talk about it! 

ELAINE

Well, then you're free tonight. You know what, I heard about this great place called La Caridad. 

JERRY

That's the last thing she said to me. She wanted to go there also, but I wasn't in the mood. 

ELAINE

Whoa. What is the matter? 

JERRY

It's Patty. 

ELAINE

Jerry, you break up with a girl every week. 

JERRY

(Crying) What--what is this salty discharge? 

ELAINE

Oh my God. You're crying. 

JERRY

This is horrible! I care! 

JERRY

Patty won't call me back. I don't know if I can live without her. 

KRAMER

She's really gotten to you, hasn't she? 

JERRY

I don't know what's happening to me. 

KRAMER

Simple. You let out one emotion, all the rest will come with it. It's like Endora's box. 

JERRY

That was the mother on Bewitched. You mean Pandora. 

KRAMER

Yeah, well, she... had one, too. (George enters) 

GEORGE

Jerry, can I talk to you for a second? (They enter Jerry's apartment) 

KRAMER

(Baseball flies at Kramer and hits him) That's it, that's it! I warned you kids. I told you not to play in front of my house. This time, I'm keepin' it. And you're not getting back your rock either! 

GEORGE

(hearing Jerry broke up with Patty) Are you still down in the dumps? Come on. It's just a chick. 

JERRY

You ever heard of a little thing called feelings? 

GEORGE

Well, I got just the thing to cheer you up. A computer! Huh? We can check porn, and stock quotes. 

JERRY

Porn quotes... I'm so lucky to have a friend like you, George. Ever tell you how much I love you? 

GEORGE

What? 

JERRY

I love you, George. Come here. 

GEORGE

I-I'm already here. I'm here. I'm here. Uh, you know what? If you want a computer, call me. I-I gotta go. 

JERRY

Go wherever you want. I'm still gonna love you. 

KRAMER

Look what they did. Look what they did to my house! I turn my back for two seconds, and they put shaving cream all over my door. You, I see you! I'll teach these kids a lesson. Where's that house I put under your sink? 

JERRY

Hose under my sink. I love *you*, Kramer! 

KRAMER

I love you, too, buddy, and George-- 

GEORGE

I don't want to hear it, Kramer! 

KRAMER

Listen, when I give you the signal, I want you to turn this water on full blast. 

GEORGE

What signal? What-what signal? 

KRAMER

I'll yell, uh, 'Hoochie mama!' 

GEORGE

If I do it, will you buy a computer? 

KRAMER

On the signal, George. On the signal. 

GEORGE

Only if you buy. I gotta make a sale. 

JERRY

I love you, Costanza. 

GEORGE

Will you shut up?! 

KRAMER

Now! Now, George! Turn on the faucet! George, turn on the faucet! Hoochie mama! Hoochie mama! Hoochie mamamaaaaa! 

ELAINE

So now the *other* Lippman kissed me. 

GEORGE

Well, sure. They're Jewish, and you're a shiksa. 

ELAINE

What? 

GEORGE

It means a non-Jewish woman. 

ELAINE

I know what it means, but what does being a shiksa have to do with it? 

GEORGE

You've got 'shiksappeal'. Jewish men love the idea of meeting a woman that's not like their mother. 

ELAINE

Oh, that's insane. 

GEORGE

I'll tell you what's insane: the price that I could get you on a new desktop computer. 

ELAINE

I am not buying a computer from you. 

GEORGE

There's porn. 

ELAINE

(Pausing) Even so. 

GEORGE

Damn it! 

ELAINE

Don't get me wrong, Mr. Lippman. I-I'm very flattered that you found me attractive enough to... lunge at me. Huh. But the only reason you like me is because I'm a shiksa. 

LIPPMAN

That's simply not true. 

ELAINE

If you weren't Jewish, you wouldn't be interested in me. 

LIPPMAN

You are wrong. I'll prove it. 

ELAINE

Oh, no. Don't! 

LIPPMAN

I renounce Judaism! 

ELAINE

Oy vey! 

JERRY

What happened to you, pal? 

KRAMER

Joey Zanfino and some of the neighborhood kids. They ambushed me with a box of 'Grade A's. 

JERRY

Are you all right? 

KRAMER

Oh, no. I'm fine. Serenity now. Serenity now. Serenity now. 

JERRY

So, you're using Frank's relaxation method? 

KRAMER

(Trying to open a back of chips) Jerry, the anger, it just melts right off. Serenity now. Look at this. Serenity now! 

ELAINE

(Enters) Hey, what happened to you? 

KRAMER

Serenity! (He exits) 

ELAINE

Well. You are not gonna believe this. Now Lippman is renounced. This shiksa thing is *totally* out of control. What is *with* you people? What are you looking at? 

JERRY

Sit down, Elaine. 

ELAINE

Oh, no. Jerry, I can't take any more gentle sobbing. 

JERRY

I've been thinking about what it means to be complete. 

ELAINE

Do you have an apple or anything? 

JERRY

Look at us, hurtling through space on this big, blue marble. 

ELAINE

Or a nectarine? I would absolutely love a nectarine. 

JERRY

Looking everywhere for some kind of meaning... 

ELAINE

Why am I in such a fruit mood? Ahh, banana! 

JERRY

When all the while, the real secret to happiness has been right in front of us! 

ELAINE

What? 

JERRY

Elaine... 

GEORGE

(Entering Jerry's apartment with a cartload of computers) Jerry, I've found a way to beat Lloyd Braun! I buy the computers myself, I store 'em in your apartment. Then, after I win the contest, I bring 'em all back and get my money back. Ha ha! It's brilliant. What? What's wrong with your leg? 

JERRY

I'm asking Elaine to marry me. 

GEORGE

(Leaving) I'll store these over at Kramer's apartment. 

JERRY

Elaine? 

ELAINE

Uhh, Jerry, I've got a lot goin' on with, uh, Lippman right now. 

JERRY

Lippman? 

ELAINE

(Trying to get her bag to leave) Yeah, and him too. What?! Oh, yeah! I think George is calling me, so I'm gonna go give him a hand. Come on! Come on! 

JERRY

Can I help you? 

ELAINE

No. Stay! Stay. Stay. 

FRANK

Hey, Braun, Costanza's kicking your butt! 

GEORGE

(using the phone) Watch how it's done. Oh, hello, Mr. Vandelay? Would you like to buy a computer? Oh, really? Two dozen? 

FRANK

Costanza, you're white hot! 

PHONE

If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and-- 

FRANK

Hey, Braun, I got good news and bad news. And they're both the same: you're fired. Costanza, you've won the water pik! 

ESTELLE

You're not gonna give away that water pik! 

FRANK

You wanna bet? Serenity now, serenity now! 

LLOYD

You know, you should tell your dad that 'serenity now' thing doesn't work. It just bottles up the anger, and eventually, you blow. 

GEORGE

What do you know? You were in the nut house. 

LLOYD

What do you think put me there? 

GEORGE

I heard they found a family in your freezer 

LLOYD

Serenity now. Insanity later. 

JERRY

What happened here, Kramer? 

KRAMER

Serenity now, serenity now... 

JERRY

Kramer! 

KRAMER

Geez! Jerry, I didn't here you come in. Yeah, the children, they've done sum redecorating. Serenity now, serenity now. 

JERRY

You don't look well. 

KRAMER

Well, that's odd, 'cause I feel perfectly at peace with the world- uh! eggs! you! Serenity now, serenity now, serenity now. 

JERRY

Oh, I'm sorry. Look at me, I stepped on your last rose. 

KRAMER

(going into his apartment) Jerry, come on. Don't get upset about it. There's always next spring. Now will you excuse me for a moment. Serenity nooooooooww! 

GEORGE

Jerry! I did it! Haha! I beat Braun! 

KRAMER

(crashing and banging in his apartment) Serenity now! 

GEORGE

Come on, wanna give me a hand with the computers? 

KRAMER

(Crashing and banging around) Serenity nooooowwwww! 

GEORGE

Why couldn't you squeeze one of those stupid rubber balls to get your stress out? Why did you have to destroy *twenty-five* computers? 

KRAMER

(Leaving) George, you listen to me. I owe ya one. 

JERRY

He's incorrigible. You want to talk about it? 

GEORGE

Oh, please don't tell me you love me again, Jerry, I can't handle it. 

JERRY

George, letting my emotions out was the best thing I've ever done. Sure I'm not funny anymore, but there's more to life than making shallow, fairly-obvious observations. How about you? 

GEORGE

All right... here goes... 

ELAINE

Rabbi, is there anything I can do to combat this Shiks-appeal? 

RABBI

Ha! Elaine, shiks-appeal is a myth, like the Yeti, or his North American cousin, the Sasquatch. 

ELAINE

Well, something's goin' on here, 'cause every able-bodied Israelite in the county is driving pretty strong to the hoop. 

RABBI

Elaine, there's much you don't understand about the Jewish religion. For example, did you know that rabbis are allowed to date? 

ELAINE

(About to leave) Well, what does that have to do...? 

RABBI

You know, a member of my congregation has a timeshare in Myrtle Beach. Perhaps, if you're not too busy, we could wing on down after the High Holidays? Elaine? 'Lainie? 

GEORGE

So, that's it. All of my darkest fears, and... everything I'm capable of. That's me. 

JERRY

Yikes. Well, good look with all that. 

GEORGE

Where you going? I-I thought I could count on you for a little compassion. 

JERRY

I think you scared me straight. 

ELAINE

All right, Jerome, I'm in. 

JERRY

What? 

ELAINE

Maybe we should get married. Maybe everything we need is right here in front of us. Jer... let's do it. 

JERRY

I tell ya, I don't see it happening. 

ELAINE

What? What happened to the new Jerry? 

JERRY

He doesn't work here anymore. 

ELAINE

Oh, well that's just *great!* 

GEORGE

I love you, Jerry. 

JERRY

(Leaving) Right back at ya, Slick. 

GEORGE

You know, all these years, I've always wanted to see the two of you get back together. 

ELAINE

Well, that's because you're an idiot. 

FRANK

You single-handedly brought Costanza and Son to the brink of bankruptcy. 

GEORGE

Well what about all the Lloyd Braun sales? 

FRANK

He's crazy. His phone wasn't even hooked up. He just liked ringing that bell. 

ESTELLE

I told you to clean out this garage. I have to put my car in! 

FRANK

This is a place of business. I told you never to come in here. Serenity now! 

ESTELLE

All right... 

GEORGE

Dad, you really should lay off the 'serenity now' stuff. 

FRANK

So, what am I supposed to say? 

GEORGE

'Hoochie mama'? 

ESTELLE

Move your crap, I'm comin' in! 

FRANK

No you're not! Hoochie mama! Hoochie mama! 

JERRY

Are you sure you can't stay longer? 

MORTY

No, we just came for the funeral. ` 

HELEN

Poor Marvin Kessler, he went too early. 

JERRY

He was 96 years old. 

MORTY

That had nothing to do with it, the man was out of shape. 

HELEN

That's why we joined a program. We walk once around the block three times a week. 

MORTY

And every morning I eat a plum. 

JERRY

Well, what ever you do, you're wearing me out. 

HELEN

What about you? 

MORTY

Yeah, looks like you're getting a little spare tire there, tiger. 

JERRY

Really? 

KRAMER

Hey, Seinfelds! 

MORTY

Hey, Mr. Kramer! 

KRAMER

How long are you staying? 

HELEN

We just came down for a funeral. 

KRAMER

Oh yeah, yeah I heard, Marvin Kessler. Boy, that makes you think. If he could go... 

HELEN

See you downstairs with the car. 

JERRY

Are you sure you don't need a hand with that? 

MORTY

No no, the luggage is on the program. I got a brick in here. 

JERRY

Did you give blood? 

KRAMER

No, not giving. hoarding. I'm storing it in to a blood bank. Just in case. 

JERRY

In case of what? 

KRAMER

Jerry, I know myself. If I'm out on the street and it's starts to go down, I don't back off until it's finished. 

JERRY

Are we finished? 

KRAMER

Done. 

VIVIAN

Elaine, I'm so glad you came out. 

ELAINE

Yeah... 

VIVIAN

You haven't seen Jimmy for years. 

ELAINE

I know, I'm glad I got to see him before he hit puberty and got, you know all lurchy and awkward. 

VIVIAN

Actually, I'm gonna need someone to look after him tomorrow evening. 

ELAINE

Tomorrow evening, sure. 

VIVIAN

Do you know anyone responsible? 

ELAINE

Do I know anyone?? 

VIVIAN

Well, if you think of anybody, give me a call. 

GEORGE

What are you doing? 

TARA

Incense, for the mood. 

GEORGE

Oh yes, by no means, the mood. Let me know if there's anything I can do to lend support to the mood. 

GEORGE

Um, cream soda? 

TARA

Vanilla. 

ELAINE

Can you believe that, Vivian doesn't think I'm responsible? 

JERRY

Who wants to responsible? When ever anything goes wrong, the first thing they ask is: who's responsible for this? 

ELAINE

I couldn't raise a kid? Come on, I love bossing people around. 

JERRY

What happened, I thought you were with Tara tonight? 

GEORGE

I was, I had to leave. She lit some vanilla incenses. The smell drove me nuts, all I could think about was food, I had to get out of there. We need some pudding here! Pudding! 

ELAINE

You just left? What did you tell her? 

GEORGE

I told I had a bus transfer that was only good just for another hour. 

JERRY

What? 

GEORGE

I don't know, I was starving Jerry! 

GEORGE

Oh, pudding! You want some? 

JERRY

Hey, you guys think I'm getting a little...chunky? 

GEORGE

What are you kidding? We look great! You know what this pudding needs? The skin on the top, you know like your mother used to make it on the stove. 

JERRY

Elaine, what do you think? 

ELAINE

I think you're getting a little pudding under the skin yourself. 

KRAMER

My service rates went up? You banks are all the same with your hidden fees and your service charges. Well, maybe I'll just take my blood elsewhere, yeah. 

EMPLOYEE

Well, we can transfer to another bank for you. 

KRAMER

Oh, no no no...no more banks. I'm keeping my blood in my freezer with...my money! 

GEORGE

So eh, what do you say? 

TARA

I guess we could use some food in our lovemaking. 

GEORGE

Ok, we got your...got your strawberries, your chocolate sauce, your pastrami on rye with mustard, your honey... 

TARA

Wait wait wait, pastrami on rye with mustard? 

GEORGE

Oh yeah yeah, don't you know they used pastrami in that movie 9? weeks? Remember the pastrami scene? 

TARA

No. 

GEORGE

Well, maybe it was Ghostbusters? Where ever it was, it worked! 

JERRY

Didn't go for it, huh? 

GEORGE

No. 

JERRY

So, she didn't appreciate the erotic qualities of the salted cured meats? 

GEORGE

She tolerated the strawberries and the chocolate sauce, but eh, it's not a meal, you know? Food and sex, those are my two passions. It's only natural to combine them. 

JERRY

Natural? Sex is about love between a man and a woman, not a man and a sandwich. 

GEORGE

Jerry, I'm not suggesting getting rid of the girl. She's integral. 

JERRY

Maybe instead of trying to satisfy two of your needs, how about satisfying one of somebody else's. 

GEORGE

Hey, speaking of which, I found a great way to separate the skin from the top of the pudding without leaving any around the edges; Exacto knife. 

JERRY

I told you George, no more pudding. I'm starting a purification program. Keep all that kind of food away from me. 

GEORGE

Well, I guess these would be out of the question. (pulls out two pudding skins in plastic bags.) 

JERRY

What the hell is that? 

GEORGE

Pudding skin singles. 

KRAMER

Hey buddy, I'm borrowing all your Tupperware. 

JERRY

Oh, why? 

KRAMER

I closed down my account at the blood bank. 

JERRY

What, it...it's here in the building? 

KRAMER

Right across the hall. What, you wanna go see? 

JERRY

No I don't! In fact, if even one corpuscles of that blood should find it's way across that hall I will freak out on you Kramer! Freak out. 

KRAMER

You know, for a fat guy you're not very jolly. 

ELAINE

Hey, working out? 

JERRY

You know it and I ditched all my junk food. 

KRAMER

What the heck is going on here? 

JERRY

Sorry buddy, clean house. It's all health food. 

KRAMER

Well, I may have to take it, but I don't have to like it. 

ELAINE

Vivian left me a message. I guess a certain someone changed her mind about whether someone was responsible enough to watch certain other someone. 

JERRY

Is this about me? 

ELAINE

No. 

JERRY

Oh, then I lost interest. 

ELAINE

Vivian, hi it's Elaine. Yeah, I'm over at Jerry's, I got your message...What? Yeah, he's right here, hold on...(hands the phone to Kramer.) 

KRAMER

For me? Go...Yeah, what tonight? Yeah, I'll be there...Yeah later. (puts the phone down) Well, somebody's baby-sitting. 

ELAINE

You? I'm more responsible than you are! 

KRAMER

Don't be ridiculous. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go to fill my freezer with my own blood. 

GEORGE

Oh, Tara! 

KRAMER

Hello, Vivian! Oh, this is a nice screen. 

ELAINE

Kramer... 

KRAMER

Don't take my money! 

ELAINE

It is me, you idiot. Hi, all right you've got to get out of here, I'm gonna baby-sit the hell out of that kid. 

KRAMER

No, I'm the baby-sitter. 

ELAINE

No no no, you're out, I'm in. Now, hit the road. 

VIVIAN

Elaine? What are you doing here? 

ELAINE

Kramer is actually sleeping one off, so I thought that I'd help out...(Kramer moans from the bushes) what's that, some raccoon or something...(hits Kramer with a broom.) 

VIVIAN

Well, I guess this would be all right. Jimmy, you remember Elaine? She's gonna watch you tonight. 

ELAINE

Hi Jimmy. (Jimmy kicks Elaine to the shin.) Ouch! (The screen door hits her in the head.) 

JERRY

Hey, what are you doing here? I thought you were baby-sitting at Vivian's. 

KRAMER

There was an incident. 

JERRY

Oh no, where's the blood? (opens the fridge) It's in here isn't it? 

KRAMER

Would you stop it. 

JERRY

What is this? 

KRAMER

It's Jell-O. 

JERRY

What about this? This is blood isn't it?! 

KRAMER

This is tomato juice, look...(drinks from the bottle.) 

JERRY

Ooh, you're sick! You're sick!! 

KRAMER

Will you calm down. I took all my blood down to Newman's. He let me put it in his meat freezer. 

JERRY

Hey, what's going on? Who made pudding? 

KRAMER

Oh yeah yeah, George he came by and made more of those pudding skin singles. They're delicious. 

JERRY

Damn that George, I told him I don't want this stuff around here anymore... 

KRAMER

Heads up! 

JERRY

Aaah... 

JIMMY

You're dead, president Lincoln! You're dead! 

ELAINE

I wish I was dead. 

JIMMY

Can I have your juice? 

ELAINE

As long as you don't put... 

ELAINE

Thanks for the re-fill. 

VIVIAN

Hey, Elaine! How did it go? 

ELAINE

Oh, he's...he's a joy... 

VIVIAN

Really? Some sitter have told me he's bit of a handful. 

ELAINE

Oh, handful of sunshine. I wish I could do this every day. 

VIVIAN

Oh Elaine, that's so good to hear. I've been having a few health problems lately. 

ELAINE

It's not serious, is it? 

VIVIAN

Well, it might be. Just in case anything does happen, it's nice to know there's somebody like you around. 

ELAINE

Oh yeah, that eh...that is nice to know. (Pours the juice from the bag back to glass.) 

JERRY

Aah! 

KRAMER

It's ok, Jerry. I'm right here. 

JERRY

I can see that! What happened? 

KRAMER

That knife, it nicked your jugular. You know Jerry, when somebody yells 'heads up', you're not supposed to actually look up. 

JERRY

I'll remember that. 

KRAMER

Anyway, you were lucky that I was there. You lost a lot of blood. 

JERRY

What? 

KRAMER

Oh yeah, you've got three pints of Kramer in you, buddy. 

GEORGE

Three pints of Kramer's blood? 

JERRY

I can feel his blood inside of me. Borrowing things from my blood. 

GEORGE

Well, so much for purification week. 

JERRY

So, how's the fornicating gourmet? 

GEORGE

Doing quite well, thank you. Yesterday I had a soft boiled egg and a quickie. You know what? If I could add TV to the equation, that would really be the ultimate. 

JERRY

George, we're trying to have a civilization here. 

ELAINE

Hey. 

JERRY

Hey, how was baby-sitting? 

ELAINE

Oh, just great. I found out that Vivian has some kind of medical problem and if the worst happens she wants me to take care of Jimmy. 

JERRY

Oh, I'm sure it won't be the worst. 

ELAINE

It doesn't matter. If anything happens to her, I'm on deck! Scissors mishap, air show disaster, chinese organ thieves...it's a dangerous world. 

GEORGE

She's right, I heard Kramer got mugged out on the suburbs on a baby-sitting gig. 

JERRY

Really? 

KRAMER

Look at this, look at the hair on the back of my neck. It's all bramble, see it's like thicket back there. Look, I need somebody to shave it for me, huh? 

JERRY

I'm not touching that thing. 

KRAMER

Well, I have to say I'm very surprised and disappointed - blood brother. 

JERRY

Oh, no... 

KRAMER

What? Jerry, I gave you my blood. Listen to your pulse, (takes Jerry hand) hey buddy-hey buddy-hey buddy... 

JERRY

Kramer, I'm not shaving your neck. 

KRAMER

So, my blood is not enough. Would you like a kidney too, because I'll give it to you? I'll rip it out right here and stack it on the table! 

JERRY

All right, all right I'll do it, sit down. 

KRAMER

No no no, I don't have time right now. I'll catch you tonight, we'll do sort of an all over kind of thing, all right? 

JERRY

Hello? 

HELEN

Kramer called, he told that you were in a hospital. 

JERRY

Kramer called you? 

HELEN

He calls every week. Are you all right? 

JERRY

Yes, I'm fine. 

HELEN

He says he's fine. 

MORTY

Tell him to eat a plum. 

HELEN

Jerry, you really have to take better care of yourself. We bought you some session with a personal trainer. 

JERRY

I don't need a personal trainer. (Kramer comes in) all right I've got to go, we'll talk about this later. 

MORTY

Plum...(Jerry hangs up.) 

JERRY

Why are you calling my parents? 

KRAMER

Well, maybe if you called more often, I wouldn't have to. Listen, is it all right if I watch a tape in here? 

JERRY

Why here? 

KRAMER

Well, I'm taping Canadian Parliament, you know on C-Span. 

JERRY

Ok... 

KRAMER

Is it all right if I watch it in your bedroom, cause your bed is really nice? 

JERRY

Fine... 

KRAMER

Ok! 

JERRY

No no no no no no no no no no! I do not want that in here! 

KRAMER

Blood! 

JERRY

All right. 

IZZY

Hello, dough boy. 

JERRY

Mr. Mandelbaum? You're the personal trainer? 

IZZY

I'm here to whip you in to shape, so grab your jocks - if you need one. It's go-time. 

VIVIAN

Elaine? Elaine? 

ELAINE

Oh, hi, oh God. I didn't here you come in. 

VIVIAN

Where's Jimmy? 

ELAINE

I don't know, I don't know...we had HoHos for dinner and then eh...and then he put this plastic bag over his head and started running around until he got tired and then he laid down somewhere I...I tell you I'm no good watching that kid. 

VIVIAN

Sleeping like an angel. Elaine, you're the best. 

ELAINE

No! I'm a scatter brain. That's why I probably can't hold a job or keep a man! 

VIVIAN

Be quiet. So, will you watch Jimmy tomorrow? 

ELAINE

All right, but I'm running out of purses here. (takes her purse from a punch ball.) 

JERRY

Ok Mr. Mandelbaum, what you want me to do? 

IZZY

Don't get puss honey, and pick up that medicine ball. 

JERRY

Is this a gym, or some kind of fitness museum? 

IZZY

Not funny, over your head with it. Are you ready? 

JERRY

For what? 

IZZY

All aboard in the pain train! 

JERRY

How many session did my parents paid for? 

IZZY

Not enough to make a man of you, daffodil. 

GEORGE

Oohoho...spicy mustard...woohoho, you're hot tonight! 

TARA

Oh, George! 

GEORGE

And now for the trifecta. (Picks up a hand held TV and gets back under the covers.) 

TARA

George? George? What are you doing?! (Pulls the covers off. George is eating a sandwich and watching TV.) 

GEORGE

Pleasuring you? 

JERRY

What is this? 

KRAMER

We're making sausages. 

JERRY

I thought you were gonna watch a video. 

KRAMER

Yeah, an instructional video about how to make your own sausages. 

JERRY

Kramer, I'm not in a mood for this. 

KRAMER

All right, all right. Newman, let's go grab some mail sacks and haul these beauties out of here. 

JERRY

Blood over there, sausages over here. I'm living in a slaughter house. 

IZZY

Tonight I want you to sleep on this. Toughens the vertebrae. (Looks at the sausages) What in holy hell? Sausages? Is this your diet? 

JERRY

No they're not mine Mr. Mandelbaum... 

IZZY

Don't lie to me, butter bean. We're taking it up a notch. 

JERRY

So, the free love buffet is over? 

GEORGE

I got greedy. Flew too close to the sun on wings of pastrami. 

JERRY

Yeah, that's what you did...I can't believe I got another session with Izzy Mandelbaum, he's probably makes me box a kangaroo. 

JERRY

What's going on? 

GEORGE

I don't know. This sandwich is making me flush. 

JERRY

Oh no, I'll tell you what you did Caligula; you combined food and sex in to one disgusting uncontrollable urge. 

GEORGE

I think you're right. You gonna eat that? 

JERRY

No, but please tell me that's all you're gonna do with it. 

ELAINE

Jerry, I tell you; if this woman dies, it is going to be a major inconvenience. 

GEORGE

These fries are really really good... 

JERRY

All right, that's enough of that. (Jerry takes the plates and hands them to a waitress.) 

ELAINE

I mean I can't shake this woman. You know, now I have to go to Jimmy's birthday party. 

GEORGE

Uuh, sleepy. 

ELAINE

No matter what I do, I cannot weasel out of raising this kid. 

JERRY

Well, sleepy here is quite a weasel, maybe he can bat for you. 

ELAINE

Yeah, that's what I need; a pinch weasel. 

KRAMER

Why did you get rid of that sausage? 

JERRY

It wasn't me, it was Mr. Mandelbaum. 

KRAMER

Yeah well, Newman's not happy, he booted me out of his freezer. Look, I've got to take my blood back to the bank, can I borrow your car? 

JERRY

What's wrong with yours? 

KRAMER

I got no A/C and I gotta keep the blood cold or it'll go bad. 

JERRY

All right, but this is it, this is the last favor, we're even! 

KRAMER

All right, Even Steven. Oh, by the way, when you get back to your apartment try to keep it down because Newman is taking a nap in your bed. 

KRAMER

Oh, man...(looks to the glove compartment for a manual.) 'If the engine begins to overheat, turn off air conditioner'. Never, I can't do that. 

KRAMER

Oh, mama... 

KRAMER

Shees, come on...(opens the radiator)..this thing is bone dry. (Looks at the blood.) 

ELAINE

Vivian... 

VIVIAN

Elaine! 

ELAINE

Hi! This is my friend George. 

VIVIAN

Hi... 

ELAINE

I'm gonna go say hi to Jimmy. 

VIVIAN

Ok. 

ELAINE

(whispering to George) You're up. 

VIVIAN

Oh, isn't Elaine fantastic? 

GEORGE

Yes she is. It's a pity we won't be seeing much more of her. 

VIVIAN

Really, why? 

GEORGE

Oh, you haven't heard, she's going to live with her grandparents in Redding Pennsylvania. 

VIVIAN

Her grandparent passed away five years ago. 

GEORGE

Yes they did. I was covering. Elaine has been deported back to Scotland. 

VIVIAN

She's American citizen, I have seen her passport. 

GEORGE

All right, no more lies. Elaine is been chosen to represent the Upper West Side in the next Biosphere project. 

VIVIAN

I haven't heard anything about another Biosphere. 

GEORGE

That's because it's underwater. 

VIVIAN

This is insane. 

GEORGE

Is it? 

VIVIAN

Yes it it. 

GEORGE

Well, it's all for charity, so what's the difference. 

VIVIAN

You...very knowledgeable. 

GEORGE

Well, I'm also an architect. Is that pastrami? 

VIVIAN

Yes it is. I find the pastrami to be the most sensual of all the salted cured meats. Hungry? 

GEORGE

Very. 

VIVIAN

Oh, wait...(Vivian turns the TV on.) Oohh... 

GEORGE

Vivian!! 

JERRY

Is this really necessary? 

IZZY

If you wanna live in a butcher shop, I'm gonna treat you like a piece of meat. 

JERRY

What if I can't keep up? 

IZZY

You lie, you dry. Fire it up, son. 

IZZY

Move it, move it! Get those knees up! Come on, kick it, kick it! 

JERRY

What's going on? 

JERRY

Oh my God, the blood! 

IZZY

Get up boy, get up! We got a problem here! Tough it up. This is for real, you've got to want it... 

ELAINE

So how long did they drag you? 

JERRY

Well, for the first quarter mile they thought that I was just doggin' it. 

ELAINE

Hi George. Hi Jimmy. 

GEORGE

Yeah, Jimmy why don't you wait outside, you know, play with something. 

GEORGE

Ouch! 

JERRY

What's the kid doing here? 

GEORGE

I'm baby-sitting! Vivian asked me to raise him if she doesn't make it. 

JERRY

Oh, that's a drag... 

KRAMER

That kid... 

JERRY

You put blood in the car?! 

KRAMER

Jerry, it was overheating. You should take better care of that thing. 

JERRY

Well, they told me that I got more blood, so I guess I owe you again. 

KRAMER

You didn't get the blood from me. 

JERRY

Then who? 

NEWMAN

Hello Jerry. 

JERRY

Aaaaahhh...!!! 

KRAMER

Aaaahhh...!!! 

NEWMAN

Aaaaahhh...!!! 

JERRY

(on the phone) Yeah. Yeah. All right. Uh-huh. 

GEORGE

(knocking on the counter and feigning a muffled, Chinese voice) Chinese food! 

JERRY

(hanging up the phone) Oh! There's my Chinese food, I gotta run. All you. 

GEORGE

Who was it? 

JERRY

I did a show for a car dealership and they're getting me a new SAAB. 

GEORGE

What about your old car? They couldn't get Kramer's blood out of it? 

JERRY

No, the engine clotted. You know who set this whole thing up for me? Frank Merman. 

GEORGE

Fragile Frankie Merman? I never liked that guy. 

JERRY

Why? He's harmless. 

GEORGE

Every summer you guys went to camp together. I was jealous. Felt like he was the summer me. 

JERRY

He was not the summer you. Besides, you had a summer me. Whitey Fisk, the guy who snuck you into Last Tango in Paris. 

GEORGE

I made him up. 

JERRY

So you never saw Last Tango in Paris? 

GEORGE

No. 

JERRY

Too bad. It was erotic. 

KRAMER

(enters) Well... I've had it with these jackbooted thugs! 

JERRY

'Pottery Barn'? 

KRAMER

I got three 'Pottery Barn' catalogs in one day. That makes eight this month. 

GEORGE

(holding a magazine cover) Mira Sorvino. Think she'd go out with me? 

JERRY

Why don't you just throw 'em out? 

KRAMER

Oh, no. I've been saving them up here in your apartment. And now, it's payback time. 'Pottery Barn' is in for a world of hurt. 

JERRY

(taking a catalog) Can I have one? I need one of those old-looking phones. So you wanna grab a bite? 

GEORGE

I can't. I gotta make the weekly call to the folks. 

JERRY

So call now. 

GEORGE

I gotta prep. I need a couple of anecdotes, a few you-were-right-abouts. It's a whole procedure. Wasn't Fragile Frankie the one that used to run into the woods every time he got upset? 

JERRY

That's him. 

GEORGE

Is he still nuts? 

JERRY

What do you think? They gave me a new car for thirty minutes of 'So, who's from out of town?' 

PUDDY

(finishing eating) Seriously, is this the best okra you've ever had, or what? 

ELAINE

Mmm. De-lish. 

PUDDY

Delish? 

ELAINE

Delish. You know, short for delicious. 

PUDDY

Oh, like scrump. 

ELAINE

Yeah. 

PUDDY

(leaving) I'm gonna be late. See ya later. 

JACK

Excuse me, can I borrow your ketchup? 

ELAINE

(passing him the ketchup) Oh, sure. 

JACK

Thank you. 

ESTELLE

(answering the phone) Hello? 

GEORGE

Hey, it's Georgie. 

ESTELLE

Let me put your father on the phone. 

GEORGE

Ma! 

FRANK

Who is this? 

GEORGE

Dad, it's me. Hey, listen, I was at Fortunoff's the other day, and, you know what, you were right. 

ESTELLE

(feigning a Chinese, muffled voice) Chinese food. 

FRANK

(hanging up) Sorry, George, our Chinese food just came. Talk to you later. 

GEORGE

Chinese food? 

KRAMER

(throwing his catalogs in the Pottery Barn store) Hey, you like sending out catalogs!? How do you like gettin' 'em back!? 

JERRY

So, maybe they had Chinese food? 

GEORGE

After dark? Please. At their age, that's like swallowing stun grenades. 

JERRY

Well, there's one way to check. Where there's Chinese food, there's leftovers. 

ELAINE

(enters) Well, gentlemen. Lainie is... in love. 

GEORGE

That's dynamite. Yeah, I'll look for the Chinese food leftovers. 

ELAINE

Hey, hey, hey! I met this guy! And it was like this, totally unreal, fairy tale moment. 

JERRY

It wasn't Whitey Fisk, was it? 

ELAINE

Oh, George's friend. Whatever happened to him? 

GEORGE

Nothing. Uh, I don't know. I gotta go. 

JERRY

So, this is beautiful. You, and Puddy, and this new guy, in a big pot of love stew. 

ELAINE

Oh, yeah... Puddy. Well, I won't fire him until I see if this new guy can... handle the workload. 

KRAMER

(entering Jerry's apartment) Will you look at this? More catalogs! 'Omaha Steaks', 'Mac Warehouse', 'Newsweek'?! I can't stop all these companies, so, I'm gonna attack this problem at the choke point. 

JERRY

Stop the mail? 

KRAMER

That's... even better! 

FRANKIE

Jerry! 

JERRY

Hey, Frankie! So, where's the car? 

FRANKIE

This is it. 

JERRY

Inside the van? 

FRANKIE

It is the van! Don't you remember, we always talked about how cool it would be to have a van and just drive? 

JERRY

We were ten. 

FRANKIE

Come on. Let's take it for a spin. 

JERRY

I don't want a van. 

ELAINE

Well, just tell him you want the SAAB. 

JERRY

You don't understand. This is Fragile Frankie Merman. When we were in camp, if you upset him, he'd run out to the woods, dig a hole, and sit in it. 

ELAINE

Well, I have an idea. Keep the van, and get a bumper sticker that says, 'If this vans a-rockin', don't come a-knockin'.' 

JERRY

Always helpful. 

ESTELLE

Oh, Georgie, what are you doing here? 

GEORGE

Just dropped in for a visit. You, uh, you never called me back. 

ESTELLE

Uh... the phone broke. 

FRANK

Well, we got to get moving. 

GEORGE

What? Where are you going? 

FRANK

We have a catered affair. 

GEORGE

You're going like that? 

FRANK

(leaving the kitchen) It's creative black tie. Move, woman. 

GEORGE

(checking the fridge) No Chinese leftovers. George is gettin' suspicious. 

JACK

Elaine, I'm sorry I'm late. 

JACK

I'm gonna be in the can. 

ELAINE

Okay, Jack. (to the cashier) Can I use your phone? 

CASHIER

Sure. 

FRANKIE

(in the van with Jerry) Nice captain's chairs, huh? 

JERRY

Aye, aye. 

FRANKIE

Oh, there's a spot. Just back up. 

JERRY

Hold on. There must be a truck backing up. 

FRANKIE

No, that's us. 

JERRY

Great. You know, Frankie, I was wondering. What if I decided that it's silly to drive a van, because, you know, I live in New York City. Is there maybe some way I could exchange it? 

FRANKIE

You don't like the van? 

JERRY

No, no, no. Just hypothetically. 

FRANKIE

I gotta go to the park. 

JERRY

No! No, you don't! No woods. I love the van. I'm a van guy. 

KRAMER

(showing Jerry his mailbox) Check it out. Rain and sleet may not stop them, but let's see them get by... these bricks. 

JERRY

Where'd you get the bricks? 

KRAMER

Jerry, the whole building is brick. 

JERRY

So you want to take a ride with me out to Jersey? I'm gonna try to sell the van to a lot. 

KRAMER

A dealer? Are you insane? No, take out an ad. Sell it privately. 

JERRY

I don't think I want to meet the people that are in the market for a used van. 

KRAMER

Come on, Jerry, just let me help you. 

JERRY

OK. 

KRAMER

All right! OK! Right, here we go. Yeah. OK, so... 'For sale. A big, juicy van.' And, ooh, you gotta put down, 'interesting trades considered.' 

JERRY

I don't want to trade. 

KRAMER

No, you don't have to. It's all about tickling their buying bone. 

JERRY

Hey, you know what? This is all your mail. They're puttin' it in my box now. 

KRAMER

Oh, that's it. They have gone too far. They keep pushing me, and pushing me. Now I got no choice but to go down there... and talk to them. 

ELAINE

Hey, Jerry. I'd like you to meet someone. This is Jack. (Heraldic harp sounds as Jerry looks at Jack's face) 

EMPLOYEE

May I help you? 

KRAMER

Yeah, I'd like to cancel my mail. 

EMPLOYEE

Certainly. How long would you like us to hold it? 

KRAMER

Oh, no, no. I don't think you get me. I want out, permanently. 

NEWMAN

I'll handle this, Violet. Why don't you take your three hour break? Oh, calm down, everyone. No one's cancelling any mail. 

KRAMER

Oh, yes, I am. 

NEWMAN

What about your bills? 

KRAMER

The bank can pay 'em. 

NEWMAN

The bank. What about your cards and letters? 

KRAMER

E-mail, telephones, fax machines. Fedex, telex, telegrams, holograms. 

NEWMAN

All right, it's true! Of course nobody needs mail. What do you think, you're so clever for figuring that out? But you don't know the half of what goes on here. So just walk away, Kramer. I beg of you. 

SUPERVISOR

Is everything all right here, Postal Employee Newman? 

NEWMAN

Yes, sir, I believe everything is all squared away. Isn't it, Mr. Kramer? 

KRAMER

Oh, yeah. As long as I stop getting mail! 

GEORGE

(surprising his parents in the kitchen) Welcome back. 

ESTELLE

Oh! 

GEORGE

Quick for a... catered affair. 

FRANK

I don't know what you mean. 

GEORGE

You ditched me. That's twice. Now I demand to know what's going on! 

FRANK

George, we've had it with you. Understand? We love you like a son, but even parents have limits. 

ESTELLE

The breakups, the firings. And every Sunday with the calls. 

FRANK

What my wife is trying to say is that this is supposed to be our time. 

GEORGE

I'm not following. 

FRANK

We're cuttin' you lose. 

GEORGE

You're cuttin' me loose? 

FRANK

Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to make love to your mother. 

GEORGE

They don't want to see me anymore! 

JERRY

But this is what you've always wanted. 

GEORGE

It is. I'm just not ready yet. 

JERRY

Aw, that's kind of sweet. 

GEORGE

Ah, shut up, Jerry. My parents think they can ignore me. Heh heh. Well, they better think again. 

JERRY

Oh, no. George, please. What are you going to do? 

GEORGE

You remember my cousin Rhisa? I'm gonna date her. 

JERRY

Mother of God. 

GEORGE

One little wink. She'll freak out, tell my parents. They'll be all over me. Who is this guy? 

JERRY

That guy Elaine's dating seems really familiar to me. I think he may have been a comedian I worked with one time. Wait a minute, what is this? 

JERRY

That is the guy! 

GEORGE

Elaine's in love with the Wiz guy? 

JERRY

No, she thinks she's in love with him. But she's just remembering this old commercial. 

GEORGE

That's pretty pathetic. 

JERRY

I know. They're not even related. 

ELAINE

(enters) Hey. 

GEORGE

Uh... hey. I'm gonna get going. 

JERRY

Hey, have fun at the... family reunion. (George exits) So, what do you know about this Jack fellow? 

ELAINE

Isn't he the best? 

JERRY

Yeah, nobody beats him. What kind of work does he do? 

ELAINE

Oh, right now he's a fact checker for New York Magazine. It's not much, but it has a certain type of quiet dignity. 

JERRY

(turning on the commercial) Right, quiet dignity. As opposed to, say, this? 

ELAINE

Oh, no. 

JERRY

Oh, yes. 

JERRY

(answering the phone) Hello? Yeah, the van is still for sale. Sure, come on buy. 

KRAMER

(rushing into Jerry's apartment) Yeah, I called about the van. 

GEORGE

(at dinner with his cousin) Some more merlot? 

RHISA

Yeah, thanks. 

GEORGE

Sure. You know, Rhisa. I've always found you... very attractive. 

RHISA

What? 

GEORGE

I know it may sound shocking. But, I just can't stop myself from... wanting you. 

RHISA

You want to borrow money, right? 

GEORGE

No, no. I-I just want us to be... together. 

RHISA

All right. 

GEORGE

All right? 

RHISA

Let's go for it. 

GEORGE

Well... we could dance around it a little first. 

RHISA

(playing footsie) Nah. Let's be bad, George. Let's be really... bad. 

GEORGE

Whoa! Whoa! Geez! 

KRAMER

(inspecting Jerry's van) So, how come you're selling it? 

JERRY

You know why I'm selling it. I hate it. 

KRAMER

How many miles? 

JERRY

Two. 

KRAMER

City or highway? 

JERRY

Look, do you really want to buy this thing, or what? 

KRAMER

(breaking the antenna) Hey, hey. Take it easy. I'm not gonna be pressured. I'll walk away right now. Is this thing bent? I'm not paying for that. 

JERRY

All right, just get out of here. 

KRAMER

All right, look. I'm going to be honest. I'm very interested in the van. 

JERRY

OK, fine. 'What do I have to do to put you in this van today?' 

KRAMER

(pointing to the newspaper ad) Well, I don't really have any money. But it says right here, 'interesting trades considered'. 

JERRY

You put that in! 

KRAMER

(pulling out an undershirt) And I'm glad I did. Here. 

JERRY

You want to trade me an undershirt? 

KRAMER

No, I want to trade you screen legend Anthony Quinn's undershirt. He took this off to do sit-ups in the park and I nabbed it. 

JERRY

That's disgusting. 

KRAMER

Well, it's my final offer. 

PUDDY

You dumped me for some idiotic TV pitchman. 

ELAINE

Look, I'm sorry, Puddy. It-it was a mistake. So, let's just put it behind us, and we can continue like this never happened. 

PUDDY

Gee, I don't know. What if we're out somewhere and you see the Maytag repairman. 

ELAINE

You're not taking me back? 

PUDDY

(leaving) That's right. 

ELAINE

He's not idiotic. He's the Wiz. And nobody beats him. Nobody... 

KRAMER

(handing out anti-mail pamphlets) Here you go. Mail is evil. Pass it on. Hey, mail blows. Fax it to a friend. 

WOMAN

Why does this dummy have a bucket on its head? 

KRAMER

Because we're blind to their tyranny. 

WOMAN

Then shouldn't you be wearing the bucket? 

KRAMER

Yeah. Move along, Betty. 

FRANKIE

Is this, uh, Jerry Seinfeld's van? 

KRAMER

Well, not anymore. He traded it to me for some Hollywood memorabilia. 

FRANKIE

I'm, uh, I'm so stupid. 

KRAMER

What? 

FRANKIE

(running away) I'm so stupid. Uh, excuse me. I'm sorry. 

KRAMER

Yeah, nice to meet you. 

JERRY

She's into it? 

GEORGE

She's leaving me dirty messages on my answering machine. 

JERRY

So have your parents found out about it? 

GEORGE

She wants to keep it quiet. She... thinks we have a real future together. 

JERRY

Brave new world, alright. 

KRAMER

(entering Monk's) Hey, you guys. 

JERRY

Hey, how's the anti-mail campaign going? 

KRAMER

Oh, it's fantastic. We were out in front of the post office today, and not one person went in. 

JERRY

It's Sunday. 

GEORGE

Why is the mailman wearing a bucket? 

KRAMER

Huh? Well, it symbolizes our persecution. 

GEORGE

Then... shouldn't you be wearing the bucket. 

JERRY

Hey, I want my van keys back. 

KRAMER

Oh, well. I, uh, thought we made a deal for Quinn's t-shirt. 

JERRY

Are you insane? Give 'em to me. 

KRAMER

No, I can't, I can't. See, I told Frank he could borrow it. Yeah, he wants to move some of George's stuff into storage. 

GEORGE

Wait a minute? He's picking up the van tonight? This is perfect. I'll drive Rhisa to someplace romantic. Then when my father slides the door open, I'm in the van kissing his brother's daughter. 

KRAMER

Oh, listen, Jerry. One of your friends came by and he was very upset that I had your wheels. 

JERRY

Oh, no, not Frankie. 

KRAMER

Well, I didn't catch his name, but then he went running into the park. 

JERRY

Oh, no, the woods! The hole! 

KRAMER

(seeing Newman pull up along side him in his truck) Hey. 

NEWMAN

Kramer, what the hell are you doing? 

KRAMER

I know, I'm gonna switch the bucket to something else. 

NEWMAN

Not that! 

KRAMER

What? 

NEWMAN

You're in trouble, Kramer. I shouldn't even be talking to you, but I'm telling you as a friend. Here's how it's going to happen: you may be walking. Maybe on a crisp, autumn day just like today. When a mail truck will slow beside you, and a door will open, and a mailman you know, maybe even trust, will offer to give you a lift. 

KRAMER

Are you through? 

NEWMAN

No! And no one will ever see you again! 

KRAMER

Are you through? 

NEWMAN

Yes. No, wait! OK, yes. 

NEWMAN

(seeing postal security officials walking towards Kramer) Quick! Get in! 

KRAMER

Oh, no, no, no. That's exactly how you said it was going down. 

NEWMAN

There's another way it can go down, and it's going down right now! 

KRAMER

No. You said a mailman I know, and you're a mailman I know! 

NEWMAN

I know you know, but you don't know what I know. 

KRAMER

(being grabbed by the security officials) Hey! 

JERRY

Frankie! Frankie! Frankie! Frankie, is that you? 

DIGGER

My name is Edgar. 

JERRY

Have a nice night. 

DIGGER

Thank you. 

FRANKIE

(digging a hole, talking to himself, and seeing Jerry's van pull up near him) Stupid... so stupid! Jerry? 

RHISA

All right, George. I'm ready. 

GEORGE

Yeah, hold on. I'm, uh, I'm just trying to get a reading on my dashboard compass. Where are my parents? 

RHISA

Geor-gie... 

FRANKIE

(running up to the van and yelling through the window) Is this Seinfeld's van? Seinfeld's van? Seinfeld's van?! 

RHISA

(hearing Frankie as George runs to the back of the van) Wait. What's he saying? 

GEORGE

I think he's saying 'Son of Sam'! Oh, my God! 

RHISA

No, they caught him. 

GEORGE

(running out and away from the van) I knew it wasn't Berkowitz! 

FRANKIE

(seeing George running away) Ohh... 

ELAINE

So I told him, 'Hit the road. I'm going back with Jack.' 

JACK

Elaine, that's the second piece of good news today. 

ELAINE

Really, what was the first? 

JACK

(pulling out his Wiz hat) They're bringing me back. Yeah. I'm the Wiz again. 

ELAINE

What? 

JACK

(dancing around) I'm the Wiz! I'm the Wiz! 

ELAINE

Well what, what about your fact-checking job? 

JACK

(dancing around) Oh... here's a fact. Uh, I'm... the Wiz! I'm the Wiz and noooobody beats me! 

JERRY

(finding Frankie, in his hole) Frankie... come on out of there. 

FRANKIE

You hate the van. 

JERRY

But I'm keeping it. As much as I hate the idea of being a van guy, it's much better than hanging out here with the nocturnal dirt people. 

FRANKIE

So, can we go for a ride? 

JERRY

Yeah, let's just get out of here. 

FRANK

(coming upon the van) Good. He left the door unlocked. 

ESTELLE

Why did Kramer have to park the van in the woods? 

FRANK

Isn't it obvious? There are no parking meters out here. 

ESTELLE

(looking inside of the van) Wow! 

FRANK

(reclining the seats in the van to a bed) Hey, look at this. Hoochie mama! 

GENERAL

Oh, my goodness. What have they done to you here? 

KRAMER

Huh? Who are you? 

GENERAL

Well, you can just call me Henry. 

KRAMER

Henry Atkins? The postmaster general? 

GENERAL

Last time I checked. 

KRAMER

Henry... can I get out of here now? 

GENERAL

Oh, oh. Sit a bit. Sit a bit. I mean, after all, I drove all the way up here from D.C. just to talk to you. 

KRAMER

Oh? 

GENERAL

I even had to cancel a round of golf with the secretary of state. Do you like golf, Mr. Kramer? 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

GENERAL

Kramer, I've been, uh, reading some of your material here. I gotta be honest with you: you make a pretty strong case. I mean, just imagine. An army of men in wool pants running through the neighborhood handing out pottery catalogs, door to door. 

KRAMER

Yeah! Ha ha. 

GENERAL

Well, it's my job. And I'm pretty damn serious about it. In addition to being a postmaster, I'm a general. And we both know, it's the job of a general to, by God, get things done. So maybe you can understand why I get a little irritated when someone calls me away from my golf. 

KRAMER

I'm very, very sorry. 

GENERAL

Sure, you're sorry. I think we got a stack of mail out at the desk that belongs to you. Now, you want that mail, don't you Mr. Kramer? 

KRAMER

Sure do! 

GENERAL

(receiving a salute from Kramer) Now, that's better. 

KRAMER

(seeing Newman walk into the office with a bucket on his head, escorted by a security man) Geez. Newman? 

NEWMAN

(whimpering) Tell the world my story. 

JERRY

Hey, George! 

GEORGE

Jerry! Hey, that's the guy! 

JERRY

What? George Costanza, Frankie Merman. 

GEORGE

Oh. The summer me. 

FRANKIE

The winter me. 

JERRY

You must be George's cousin. 

RHISA

Girlfriend. 

JERRY

All right. 

GEORGE

(seeing Jerry's van shaking) What is that? That van's a-rockin'. 

JERRY

Don't go a-knockin'. 

ESTELLE

(after George opens the van door) Oh, my god! 

GEORGE

(seeing his parents being intimate) Oh, my god! 

FRANKIE

Now you gotta sell this van. 

JERRY

Oh, yeah. 

FRANK

What you saw in that van was a natural expression of a man's love for his lady. 

GEORGE

Ohhhh... 

ESTELLE

Your father's right. It's beautiful. 

FRANK

And it was safe. 

GEORGE

Oh, God... 

FRANK

Now if you'll excuse me. Once again, your mother and I... 

GEORGE

Oh... make it stop. 

JERRY

I just think if you borrow my blender you should return it. 

KRAMER

Well what's the difference -- Come on (pats him on the back) -- were like Cain and Able. 

JERRY

Yeah, ya know Cain slew Able. 

KRAMER

No he didn't. They were in business together... it was dry wall, or somethin'. 

JERRY

Oh, no. 

KRAMER

All right then, what was it? 

JERRY

Well I think Able worked hard all summer harvesting his crops, while Cain just played in the field. Then when Winter came, Able had all the nuts; Cain had no nuts, so he killed him. 

KRAMER

The way I remember it, Cain, he was a successful doctor, but when he took this special formula, he became Mr. Able. 

JERRY

Ya broke my blender, didn't ya? 

KRAMER

Yeah. Well I was trying to make gravel and it just (moves hands around) just didn't work out. 

JERRY

I knew it. 

JERRY

Why were you making gravel? 

KRAMER

Well ... I like the sound it makes when you walk on it. 

KRAMER

Aahh, this looks familiar... 

JERRY

Of course. It's garbage. 

KRAMER

No, no, no, no. These brown things. The chairs. (hits his hand on the rim) Jerry, this is the set from the old Merv Griffin Show! (he climbs into the dumpster) They must be throwing it out. This stuff belongs in the Smithsonian! 

JERRY

Yeah, at least in the dumpster behind the Smithsonian. 

KRAMER

Look at this. Boy, one minute Elliot Gould is sitting on you and the next thing - you're yesterday's trash. 

JERRY

Come on, Kramer, get out of there. 

KRAMER

No, no, no. You go on ahead. I'm not finished taking this in. Oh, Jerry look ... Merv Griffin's cigar. 

JERRY

(moans) Ohhh (walks away) 

GEORGE

You know I uh, spilled a yogurt smoothie in here two days ago. Hm, Can't smell anything, can ya? 

MIRANDA

Banana? 

GEORGE

Right. 

MIRANDA

George watch out for those pigeons. 

GEORGE

Oh they'll get out of the way. You really smell banana? 

MIRANDA

(gasp) Oh my God. (trying to catch her breath, she puts her hand to her chest.) 

GEORGE

So uh... where we eating? 

JERRY

And it was his idea to put a sprig of parsley on the plate. 

CELIA

You're making this up. There was never a Joseph Garnish. 

JERRY

Wow! (Jerry spots all the classic toys) 

CELIA

Oh yeah the toys. 

JERRY

Where did you get all these? 

CELIA

My dad was a collector. I inherited them after he died from a long painful bout with... 

JERRY

Super bowl! Hey, an original G.I. Joe. (picks up both items) With a full frogman suit. 

CELIA

Jerry, what are you doing? 

JERRY

I'm putting this on him and we're going to the sink. 

CELIA

Ohhh Jerry. (takes them from Jerry and puts them back with the other toys) They're priceless. They've never been played with. 

JERRY

I just want a, touch 'em a little. 

CELIA

I said no. Now come here. 

LOU

Hi (startled, Elaine spills her coffee on her sleeve) I'm Lou Filerman. I'm new here. 

ELAINE

Hey Walter, what is the deal with that guy? 

WALTER

uh-He's Lou Filerman. He's new here. 

ELAINE

(exhales) 

WALTER

Hey your coffee stain looks like Fidel Castro. 

ELAINE

You've been an enormous help. 

JERRY

You ran over some pigeons? How many? 

GEORGE

What ever they had. Miranda thinks I'm a butcher but i-i-it's not my fault is it? Don't we have a deal with the pigeons? 

JERRY

Course we have a deal. They get out of the way of our cars, we look the other way on the statue defecation. 

GEORGE

Right! And these pigeons broke the deal. I will not accept the blame for this! 

JERRY

So Miranda's cooled on ya? 

GEORGE

I'm getting nothing. 

JERRY

Yeah, me neither. 

GEORGE

Really? I thought you and Celia were sleeping together? 

JERRY

Oh, the sex is wild but she's got this incredible toy collection and she won't let me near it! 

GEORGE

I don't understand women. 

JERRY

Here comes one. 

ELAINE

Hey. What's going on? 

GEORGE

Hey (sees the coffee stain) Art Garfunkel? 

ELAINE

No, Castro. 

GEORGE

Right. 

ELAINE

All because of this creepy new guy at work. He just - he just comes out of nowhere and he's right next to you! 

JERRY

So he just sidles up? 

ELAINE

That's right! He's a real sidler. (points at Jerry) 

JERRY

Maybe you just didn't see him. 

ELAINE

Wha-You never see him. He sidled me again in my office. I was sitting there making Cup-A-Soup singing that song from 'The Lion King'. 

JERRY

Hakuna Matata? 

ELAINE

I thought I was alone. 

JERRY

That doesn't make it right. 

JERRY

See, to me, the Hakuna Matata is not nearly as embarrassing as the cup of soup... 

ELAINE

Would you just, let it go? 

KRAMER

(from his apartment) Hey, Jerry! Come here a sec! 

KRAMER

Hey! (moving a chair onto the set) 

JERRY

Oh my God! 

KRAMER

(Outstretched arms) It's the Merv Griffin set. (Claps 7 times) 

JERRY

How did you get this in here? 

KRAMER

Oh, you just bring it in sideways and (pop) hook it. 

JERRY

So where you gonna sleep? 

KRAMER

Yeah ... backstage. 

ELAINE

Ehnn! This chair smells like garbage. 

KRAMER

(putting on jacket) Oh, well a lot of the stars from the 70's - they were not as hygienic as they appeared on TV. You take Mannix for example. 

JERRY

I'm gonna get that. (walks across the set towards the blue curtain) 

KRAMER

All right. Well, Jerry, we'd love to have you back anytime. (stretches his arm out, as if he's reaching out a good-bye) 

KRAMER

Well, Elaine Benes! Well, it's great to have you! (Elaine sits down) Boy, is it possible that you're even more beautiful than the last time I saw you? 

ELAINE

(giggles) 

GEORGE

Ahh, Ah-Ah...We had a deal! 

ELAINE

Mr. Peterman, here are these pages that you wanted. 

PETERMAN

One moment. I'm reading the most fascinating article on the most fascinating people of the year. Annnnnd, done. Oh, yes. I'm sorry I needed this so quickly (leafing through the pages). It must have been an awful lot of work. Thank you very much, you two. 

ELAINE

What? (with arms crossed, she turns quickly and... ) 

JERRY

So three dates and she still won't let me play with her toys. 

KRAMER

Hm, That's interesting. You know someone mentioned to me you were not very happy with your toys, growing up. 

JERRY

Yeah, that was me. 

KRAMER

Oh, that's right, right, right. And uh you mentioned that uh, you didn't get a G.I. Joe. You had an... 

JERRY

An Army Pete. 

KRAMER

Right. 

JERRY

He was made of wood and in the rain he would swell up and then split. 

KRAMER

And we all know how painful that can be. (as he says this, he turns and speaks directly into the non-existent television camera. Jerry looks a bit confused.) 

ELAINE

Jerry. Oh there - - 

KRAMER

Oh, Elaine Benes. Well, this is quite a thrill, yes. Come - - (motions for Jerry to move down one seat as the new guest has arrived for her segment. Kramer gives Jerry a little push) Come on sit down. Yes. 

ELAINE

(clears throat) (to Jerry) Well, I'll tell ya, this sidler guy is really chapping my hide. 

KRAMER

Ju - Excuse me. Yeah we're, talking this way. 

ELAINE

Well, he's getting credit for work that I did! He's gonna sidle me right out of a job. 

KRAMER

Ah, Now, for those of us who don't know, uh, sidling is what? 

ELAINE

Kramer, what is wrong with you? 

KRAMER

What do you mean? 

ELAINE

Well, for starters, you're looking at note cards 

ELAINE

(to Jerry) I'm gonna have to give that guy a taste of his own medicine, so, I am going to sidle, the sidler. 

JERRY

You, sidle? Y-You ... you stomp around like a Clydesdale! 

ELAINE

Not with these honeys. ... Wrestling shoes! 

KRAMER

(to the imaginary TV camera) Only in New York. ... ha ha 

GEORGE

Jerry? 

KRAMER

Oh! (turns on the Merv Griffin theme music) Heeeyy! Well, ladies and gentlemen! It's our good friend, George Costanza! What a surprise! 

RECORDER

Turn Music Off (Kramer pushes the off button turning the music off) 

KRAMER

Yeah, sit, sit, sit... Weeell! (laughing, clapping) 

GEORGE

Well, it happened again. 

JERRY

What happened? 

KRAMER

Eyaaaya-ya-ya, I'll ask the questions. What happened? 

GEORGE

Well I just stomped some pigeons in the park. They - they didn't move. 

KRAMER

All right, let's uh, change the subject, ah. (looking at the yellow note cards) Now, uh you and uh, Jerry dated for a while. Tell us ah ... what was that like? 

KRAMER

That was the wrong card. 

GEORGE

I-I don't get these birds! They're breaking the deal. It-it's like the pigeons decided to ignore me! 

JERRY

So they're like everyone else. 

KRAMER

(laughs too loudly) All right, let's take a short break. 

KRAMER

... Okay ah, (checks his watch) We're back! 

GEORGE

Boy that-that bank clock is-is eight minutes off. 

MIRANDA

Then why don't you just run IT over too? 

GEORGE

Zing. 

MIRANDA

George, what are you doing? 

GEORGE

Did you see that? That-that pigeon didn't move! I had to swerve to get out of the way! I saved that pigeons life! 

MIRANDA

What pigeon? You drove right into that squirrel. (leaves the car) 

GEORGE

Squirrel? Well, we have no deal with THEM! 

JERRY

(sound of gunfire) Pkew, pkew, pkew, pkew, Pkeeew! 

CELIA

Jerry! (she slides away from him) ... Those hands! They never stop! 

JERRY

I'm sorry. Got any booze? What's say you and I get ripped! 

CELIA

No. Thanks. I have a headache. Can you just get me an aspirin? 

JERRY

All right. 

JERRY

Ohh, will not 'cause drowsiness' 

LOU

Here's the new copy you wanted. 

PETERMAN

Ah, yes. Well this certainly looks like a lot of words. In record time. I'm very impressed ... with both of you. 

ELAINE

(winks and clicks) Thank you. ha ha ha ha. (sits down) 

PETERMAN

Unfortunately, I am also disgusted. This is incoherent drivel! This is a total redo. And I'm assuming I need it right away. 

ELAINE

Well, I guess we'll just have - (Lou has left) Ohh, just gimme that. (takes the papers and walks away) 

JERRY

Uhn-uh-uhn - Uhn-uh-uhn - - veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer... A-Ha ha! Mission accomplished! Back to base, Joe. (singing) dee, de-de, de-de-de-de-de (Makes G.I. Joe swim off, legs kicking) 

MIRANDA

Doctor is the squirrel going to live? 

DOCTOR

There's been massive trauma. We could of course try to save him but, it would be costly, difficult and we'd have to send away for some special really tiny instruments. 

GEORGE

Well, uh, are there any other options? 

DOCTOR

We, could put him to sleep. 

GEORGE

What might that cost? 

DOCTOR

Well it's by the pound. So ... about 80 cents. 

GEORGE

Well? (Miranda hits George) I was just - I'm curious, that's all. We, uh. We'd like you to, do everything possible. 

DOCTOR

He, um. He's not going to be the same, you know? 

GEORGE

Yeah. yeah. I-I know. 

GEORGE

So they're flying the tiny instruments in from El Paso. 

KRAMER

El Paso? I spent a month there one night. 

NEWMAN

(laughs - T-heheheheheheheh) El Paso! 

JERRY

What's he here for? 

NEWMAN

eue-aaa. 

KRAMER

Ah to take some of the pressure off of me. So, Jerry ah, what's going on with you? I understand there's a young lady in your life. mmm. 

JERRY

Well, actually, it's kind of a funny story because she has this amazing toy collection and last night I finally got to play with them. 

KRAMER

Well. Sounds like things are progressing. Do I hear, wedding bells? 

NEWMAN

Are you married right now? (points at Jerry) 

KRAMER

Newman. (Kramer smacks Newmans' arm) 

JERRY

Actually she doesn't even know about the toys. I gave her the wrong kind of medicine and I, guess she passed out! 

KRAMER

What do you mean 'wrong kind of medicine'? 

JERRY

She's even got that old Mattel football game that we love! 

GEORGE

Oh, come on! You gotta get me over there! 

KRAMER

Wait a minute, wait a minute! You mean to say that you drugged a woman so you could take advantage of her toys? Let's pause a moment. (Newman starts the taped music) Jerry, now, what you do with your personal life is your business, but when you're on my set - you clean it up, mister! 

NEWMAN

I told you he was a risk. 

JERRY

Oh, like he's not just carrying you! And has been for years! 

NEWMAN

Yeah? Well, you bombed! That story stunk worse than these chairs! 

KRAMER

Smile, everyone! We're back! 

LOU

You wanted to see me, Elaine? 

ELAINE

Yes, Lou. (exhales) You've got a lot going for you. You're um ... you're spontaneous. You're, symmetrical. You're, uh, ... (spins around as Lou is behind her now) Ehh - you're very quick, aren't ya. Um, It's just that your... 

LOU

My dead tooth? 

ELAINE

No. Your. (breathes) 

LOU

Not my breath? 

ELAINE

Uuhhh. 

LOU

What can I do? 

ELAINE

Well, you should never ever go anywhere, (shakes a box of Tic Tacs) without these. 

LOU

Thanks, Elaine. You're such a super lady! (he opens the door and goes into the hall - now he clicks and clacks when he walks) 

GEORGE

More wine and turkey? (Pours Celia more wine) 

CELIA

Hmm. (takes a sip) 

JERRY

So when I saw George on the street with an 18 pound turkey and a giant box of wine, I thought: ... What a coincidence. We're just about to eat. 

CELIA

What is that stuff in turkey that makes you sleepy? 

GEORGE

Tryptophan.* (*footnote - see end of script) 

CELIA

Ahh. 

JERRY

... I think. Have some more wine. (Jerry pours his whole glass of wine into her glass.) 

CELIA

What video did you get? 

GEORGE

Oh. 

JERRY

Oh, George brought home movies of his boyhood trip to Michigan. 

GEORGE

Four hours. 

JERRY

More heavy gravy? 

GEORGE

(playing with toys) Ahhhh, Yes! Touch down! Your turn, Jerry. (hands Jerry the Mattel Football. George starts playing with the Etch-a-sketch.) 

NEWMAN

Lately, though, I've been, uh, - I've been buying the generic brand of waxed beans. You know, I rip of the label... I can hardly tell the difference. 

KRAMER

We've officially bottomed out, mm. Who's our next guest? 

NEWMAN

We got no one! 

KRAMER

We need a new format. We should shut down and re-tool. 

NEWMAN

What about a guest-host? 

KRAMER

I'll pretend I didn't hear that. 

MIRANDA

Doctor, how's the squirrel? 

GEORGE

Is he dead? 

DOCTOR

No. Fortunately, the special tiny instruments arrived just in time. Would you like to visit him? 

MIRANDA

Yes he would. 

DOCTOR

You uh, You have 30 minutes. (Doctor exits. George turns and looks towards the doctor) 

GEORGE

So ... uh, squirrel. 

DOCTOR

One more thing Mister Costanza, we just need to know what time you'll be picking him up tomorrow. 

GEORGE

What's that? 

DOCTOR

Oh, we're discharging the squirrel. We think he'll be better off at home. 

GEORGE

He has no home. He's a squirrel. 

DOCTOR

Hmm-hm. Your home, Mister Costanza. Just make sure he gets his medicine six times a day and keep his tail elevated. (exits) 

JERRY

Maybe it'll be fun having a pet. 

GEORGE

It's not a pet! It's a wild invalid! And it knows that I tried to kill it. As soon as it gets better, it's gonna gnaw my brain out in my sleep! 

KRAMER

Jerry, (claps) aaya - what are you doin' tomorrow? I want you to come by the set. 

JERRY

What about my 'questionable material'? 

KRAMER

Nope, we got a whole new format. Edgy, youthful, plus ... we got Jim Fowler! 

JERRY

Jim Fowler? The animal guy from 'Wild Kingdom' is coming to your apartment? 

KRAMER

Well, I practically raised his kids. 

GEORGE

That's perfect! He's a zoo guy! He take's care of animals. C-Can I bring the squirrel by? 

KRAMER

What? Two animal acts on the same show? (turns to Jerry) What is this, amateur hour? Look, George, I'm sorry, maybe another time, all right? (drums table and exits) 

GEORGE

I gotta get to Fowler. I know that he would take this squirrel off my hands. It's practically bionic! 

ELAINE

Hey! (startles Jerry and George) ha ha ha ha. Nice sidle, huh? Speaking, of which I think I've got that problem, solved. 

JERRY

Tic-Tacs work? 

ELAINE

He's a human maraca. 

GEORGE

Boy, my knuckles are still cramped from that football game. 

ELAINE

You took him over to Celia's? 

JERRY

What? It's a victimless crime. 

ELAINE

What about the woman who's been drugged and taken advantage of? 

JERRY

Okay, one victim. 

ELAINE

I think it's unconscionable. 

GEORGE

Hey, last night, I found a whole Weeble Village right behind the EZ Bake oven. 

ELAINE

EZ Bake oven? 

ELAINE

Who wants cupcake? 

GEORGE

Oh, me, me, me, me, me! 

JERRY

You know, that batter is, like, 30 years old. 

FRANK

(on TV) You step on it and it flushes. 

ELAINE

Why is your father giving a tour of a rest stop? 

ESTELLE

(on TV) Stop squirming. 

GEORGE

Oh, don't look. T-This is the part where they change me. 

JERRY

You're like eight years old. 

ESTELLE

(on TV) Georgie. 

GEORGE

I was seven and a half. 

PETERMAN

That noise. That's the noise! 

ELAINE

What? 

PETERMAN

That infernal rattling sound that has plagued me these past two days - and I could not find the source. In my office, in the hallway. Even in the men's room! Shame on you, Elaine! 

ELAINE

No, no, Mr. Peterman that wasn't me! 

PETERMAN

That reminds me of the Hatian Voodoo rattle torture! You haven't gone over to their side have you? 

ELAINE

No Mister Peterman. 

PETERMAN

Because, if I hear one more rattle - just one - your out on your can. And if you are undead - I'll find out about that too. (Exits) 

ELAINE

(pushes Lou into the room) Lou! In here! (closes the door) We have to talk. 

LOU

Oh, right. 

ELAINE

(Takes the Tic Tacs away from Lou) Ooh, stop it! Bad voodoo. You gotta stop using these. 

LOU

Why? 

ELAINE

Because they're turning your teeth green? 

LOU

I only buy the white ones. 

ELAINE

O-kay ... well then your teeth are green for a different reason. You just gotta stop carrying these, okay? Just ... just mouth wash. 

LOU

I can't. It burns my cankers. 

ELAINE

Binaca? 

LOU

Again. 

ELAINE

Right, right, cankers. Um, I got it! Chew gum! 

LOU

I hate gum. The only guy I ever liked came with the Mickey Mouse gumball machine. They stopped making that 20 years ago. 

ELAINE

Well, stinky, this is your lucky day. 

KRAMER

Okay. A little later, we're gonna be talking with animal expert, Jim Fowler. 

FOWLER

Where are the cameras? (he has a live Hawk perched on his arm) 

KRAMER

But first, we're talking with, Jerry. (looks down to his yellow note cards) Okay, Jerry, uh, you uh, you drugged a woman in order to play with her toy, collection. How do you feel about that? 

JERRY

It was great! I've done it a few more time since then. 

KRAMER

And she doesn't know anything, about this? 

JERRY

No, not a thing. 

KRAMER

Well, Jerry, we have a little surprise for you! Come on out, Celia! 

CELIA

What kind of a sick twisted creep are you? 

KRAMER

Woah. 

JERRY

What, What is this? What is she doing here? 

KRAMER

It's the new format. Scandals and Animals. Git gt gt. 

CELIA

If you think you can drug me and play with my toys, you got another thing coming, buddy! 

NEWMAN

Go girl! 

JERRY

Well, what kind of woman drinks an entire box of wine? 

KRAMER

Ohhh! 

GEORGE

Mister Fowler, I-I have a squirrel here that is a miracle of modern science! (laughs) 

KRAMER

George I told you we're booked! 

FOWLER

Careful. Hawks and squirrels don't get along together. 

KRAMER

Ohhh. another interesting confrontation. This could be spicy. Yeah, George bring him over. 

GEORGE

Uh. 

FOWLER

No, you idiot! Hawks eat squirrels! 

GEORGE

Ahhhh, Ahh, Ah, Ahhh, Ahh, Ah! 

KRAMER

(off camera) Are we getting this? 

JERRY

So the whole set was destroyed? 

KRAMER

Well, the squirrel kept scurrying and the hawk kept clawing. 

GEORGE

Well, at least we know the prosthetic squirrel hips work ... sorry 'bout the set. 

KRAMER

I'll tell ya it was a grind having to fill 10 hours a day. I'm not sure I was ready to have my own talk show set. 

MIRANDA

I got the nut bread, George. Let's go. (exits) 

JERRY

So the squirrel's gonna make it? 

GEORGE

Yeah, he's in my bed. I'm... sleeping on the couch. 

JERRY

On the couch? So you're... 

GEORGE

Still getting nothing! 

GEORGE

So go ahead pigeons. hu hu hu. Laugh it up. I'm getting in my car now and the last I heard ... we have NO DEAL! 

CELIA

I'm glad you called, Elaine. I really needed to talk to someone. 

ELAINE

Oh well, hey, I dated Jerry too. I-I know what a monster he can be. More wine and turkey? 

CELIA

Who's he? (Lou) 

ELAINE

Oh, he's nobody. Hey, listen, ... let me top that off for ya. (pours her glass of wine into Celia's glass) 

ELAINE

Hey. 

JERRY

Morning. 

ELAINE

Look, this is crazy, I can't go on like this. 

JERRY

But why? 

ELAINE

I need some space. 

GEORGE

Does that mean I have to go too? 

JERRY

You don't think she's just talking to me? 

GEORGE

Hey, shut up. 

JERRY

You shut up. 

ELAINE

I hate this. 

KRAMER

You'll get used to it. It's like a grubby scrub. 

ELAINE

No, I don't want this anymore. 

JERRY

We'll come to work with you. 

GEORGE

And on your dates. 

JERRY

And shopping. 

KRAMER

And to the bathroom. 

KRAMER

Elaine, Elaine, Elaine, Elaine...(distant alarm sound which is getting louder.) 

ELAINE

I can't breath...I'm sorry...(Elaine wakes up) You're killing me! 

ELAINE

(Banging the wall) Turn your alarm off!! (Screams) 

KRUGER

Your background is impressive George, but how does it apply to what we do here, at Kruger Industrial Smoothing? 

GEORGE

Well, at the Yankees it was all about smoothing things over, you know, chiseling away, grinding down. In fact we used to call it 'the grind'. 

KRUGER

It says here that you worked at Play Now for four days? 

GEORGE

That should be 14, let me just...(corrects it with a pen.) 

KRUGER

George, I have to honest; I could go either way with you...but what the hell, we need someone, huh. 

GEORGE

You won't regret this, sir. 

KRUGER

I don't care. Let's find you an office. 

JERRY

The boom box incident? 

GEORGE

Summer of '89 I'm at the beach. This family sits up next to me. I go in to the surfs and when I come from out, my clothes, my towel, my umbrella, they're all gone. I am furious, I start screaming to these kids demanding my stuff back and finally I lose it; I grab their boom box and I chuck it in to the ocean. 

JERRY

Seems reasonable. 

GEORGE

Then I see my clothes floating out there. The tied took them out, not the kids. 

JERRY

Even more reasonable. 

GEORGE

So now, the father is screaming at me, he's demanding that I pay for the boom box. Finally, I gave them a fake address and got the hell out of there. 

JERRY

And that guy is your new boss? 

GEORGE

Until that stupid photo jogs his memory. 

KRAMER

Kruger? That's not Kruger Industrial Smoothing, is it? 

GEORGE

Yeah. 

KRAMER

Grinders, sanders, wet stones. They are the ones who botched the Statue of Liberty job. 

JERRY

Right, they couldn't get the green stuff off. 

GEORGE

It is a horrible company. There's no management what so ever. I could go hog wild in there. 

KRAMER

You now what you do? You sneak that photo out of there for couple of days and get it air brushed. 

GEORGE

Like retouched. 

KRAMER

You remember that photo of me and Gerald Ford and I took it in. Got that Ford right out of there. 

GEORGE

Oh, this is good. This Kruger guy is clueless. I can't wait to work for him. 

KRAMER

Look at this. This sandwich is terrible. Everywhere you go, they give you this misshaped shardy meat. Look at this... 

KRAMER

I haven't had a decent sandwich in 13 years. 

JERRY

Neither have I. 

KRAMER

Hey, our meat problems are solved. 

JERRY

Where did you get this thing? 

KRAMER

I traded it to my sausage press. Look how thin that is, see that's all surface area. The taste has nowhere to hide. 

ELAINE

Hey. 

KRAMER

Hey, spice. (gives Elaine a piece of meat.) Welcome to flavor country. 

ELAINE

Yeah, that's pretty good. 

JERRY

Hey, I got a date with that doctor you met. 

ELAINE

Sara Sitarides? 

JERRY

Mmhu. 

ELAINE

Oh...(falls in to the sofa.) 

JERRY

What's with you? 

ELAINE

You remember that next door neighbor of mine, the apartment that always smells like potatoes? 

JERRY

Your whole building smells like potatoes. 

ELAINE

This jackass goes to Paris, leaves the alarm on. It's been beeping since 3:30 this morning. 

KRAMER

You know, that happened to Lomez, so he blew his neighbor's circuit. 

ELAINE

How do you do that? 

KRAMER

Yeah well, that's easy. Just let me finish this mile high and I'll be right with you. Oh, and Jerry, we are gonna need a case of Kaiser rolls. 

JERRY

I think we might have one left in the stock room. 

KRAMER

This hallway smells like potatoes. 

ELAINE

I know, I know, this is it. (points to a door.) 

KRAMER

Ok, oh, you see this socket it's probably connected to her apartment. So what we'll do, we'll take this paper clip and bend it so it'll short out the entire circuit. Here you go... 

ELAINE

I think I'll let you do it. 

KRAMER

No no no. It's easy, you just...do it quickly. 

ELAINE

No, I really don't want to. 

KRAMER

Well, I don't want to either. 

ELAINE

I thought you had done this before. 

KRAMER

It's just...it's no picnic. 

ELAINE

Well, how are we gonna do it? 

KRAMER

Alright, fine fine, I'll do it. 

KRAMER

Oh mama. 

ELAINE

Are you okay? 

KRAMER

I will lose that nail. 

SARA

I enjoy the challenge of medicine. Naturally you have no idea what it's like to have someone's life depending on you. 

JERRY

Well, I have this neighbor... 

SARA

A joke. Do you have any idea how it feels like to save someone's life? 

JERRY

Is it anything like hitting a home run in softball? 

SARA

No. 

JERRY

Cause I hit a whopper last week! 

CLERK

Here you go, airbrushed in to sand and sky. 

GEORGE

What did you do here? You took out the wrong guy. 

CLERK

I thought you said you wanted to be out? 

GEORGE

Well, I'm still here. You took out the other guy! 

CLERK

You've really lost a lot of hair. 

GEORGE

I am aware! 

ELAINE

The cat. 

JERRY

He took out Kruger? 

GEORGE

I just pray Kruger doesn't realize that it's gone until this guy can fix it up. 

KRAMER

This slicer is indomitable. 

JERRY

Where did you get that butcher's coat? 

KRAMER

You buy enough meat, they'll give you anything. 

ELAINE

Kramer, my neighbor has a cat. When you blew the power, we must've shut off the automatic feeder. 

KRAMER

See, that's the same thing that happened to Lomez. 

ELAINE

What did he do about it? 

KRAMER

Well, he moved to a hotel and the cat eventually died. 

ELAINE

Well, this meowing is absolutely worst than the alarm. 

KRAMER

Oh, that's a prickly one. 

ELAINE

Yeah, how's the doctor date? 

JERRY

Eh, died on the table. Just spent hour and a half making me feel, if I don't save lives, I'm worthless. 

ELAINE

Well, she's very focused. Dermatology is her life. 

JERRY

Dermatology? 

ELAINE

Yes, she's a dermatologist. 

JERRY

Saving lives? The whole profession is; eh, just put some aloe on it. 

KRAMER

The slicer! Elaine, let's go. 

ELAINE

Where are we going? 

KRAMER

The cat. Just grab that meat and let's ride. 

GEORGE

When are you going on your next date with her? 

JERRY

Oh, what's the point? 

GEORGE

What, you're gonna pass up a wonderful opportunity to put that aloe pusher in her place? 

JERRY

Revenge date? That sound like you more than me. 

GEORGE

This good be so sweet, Jerry. Saving lives? She's one step away working at the clinique counter! 

JERRY

Dermatologist? Skin doesn't need a doctor! 

GEORGE

Of course not! Wash it, dry it, move on! 

JERRY

You're right. I'm gonna call her right now and tell her off. 

GEORGE

No no no no no, this has to be carefully orchestrated. You go to a fancy dinner, flowers... 

JERRY

Flowers? 

GEORGE

Yeah, you gotta do it classy (wipes his mouth to his sweater.) 

JERRY

So, you've done this? 

GEORGE

Almost. Couldn't get the girl go out with me the second time. 

KRAMER

I think we are looking half a millimeter. 

ELAINE

Can it cut that thin? 

KRAMER

Oh, I've cut slices so thin, I couldn't even see them. 

ELAINE

How did you know you cut it? 

KRAMER

Well, I guess I just assumed. 

ELAINE

Hold on kitty, dinner's coming. 

KRAMER

Yeah, that's a hall of famer. 

ELAINE

Alright, let's do it. 

KRAMER

Alright, here we go. Yeah, watch that baby slide...(Puts a slice of meat under the door.) 

ELAINE

Come on, come on kitty...(slice disappears) ooh...how about that; it worked! Wow, can I borrow that thing for a while? 

KRAMER

Oh no, I don't think so. 

ELAINE

Why not? 

KRAMER

Well, you're not checked at on it. 

ELAINE

What do I have to know? 

KRAMER

Well, where the meat goes? 

ELAINE

Right there. 

KRAMER

Where do you turn it on? 

ELAINE

Right there. 

KRAMER

But where does the meat go? 

SARA

Restaurant, flowers...this is so nice. 

JERRY

Well, I'm a classy guy. How's the life saving business? 

SARA

It's fine. 

JERRY

It must take a really really big zit, to kill a man! 

SARA

What is with you? 

JERRY

You call yourself a lifesaver. I call you pimple popper MD! 

PARRY

Dr. Sitarides? 

SARA

Mr. Parry, how are you? 

PARRY

I just wanted to thank you again for saving my life. 

JERRY

She saved your life? 

PARRY

I had skin cancer. 

JERRY

Skin cancer! Damn. 

ELAINE

You were right Kramer, this slicer is absolutely amazing...yeah, yeah...no no no I'll bring it by tonight...ok bye. 

ELAINE

These heals are so uneven. (Watches the slicer.) 

CLERK

Here you Mr. Costanza. 

GEORGE

What is this? This is a drawing. 

CLERK

Looks real, doesn't it? 

GEORGE

This is a cartoon! 

CLERK

Hey, I had to draw that guy from memory. Considering, I think that's damn good. 

GEORGE

But it's not a photograph, I need a photograph! 

CLERK

Then you better get a camera. 

JERRY

He looks like a Peanuts character. 

GEORGE

I know. The only way to fix it now, is to get a whole new photo of Kruger. 

JERRY

You can do that. 

GEORGE

Without his shirt on. 

JERRY

You can't do that. Well, maybe Kruger wasn't the place for you. 

GEORGE

It seemed so disorganized. 

JERRY

I understand. 

GEORGE

What about the Coast Guard? Seems like a lot of pride there, a lot of tradition. 

JERRY

True. You mean, for you? 

GEORGE

I think. 

JERRY

What about your sea sickness? 

GEORGE

Maybe I could be a land guy. 

JERRY

I don't know if they have land guys. 

GEORGE

Someone's have to unhook the boat before it leaves...the place! 

ELAINE

Pliers? 

JERRY

Drawer. 

ELAINE

Got it. 

JERRY

What are they for? 

ELAINE

I...eh...I got a piece a my heal stuck in a slicer. 

JERRY

Come again? 

ELAINE

Okay, I got a little slicer happy, but listen; don't tell Kramer, okay? He has very strong feelings for it. 

GEORGE

I forgot to ask you; how did the revenge date go? 

JERRY

Eh, it went okay. 

GEORGE

Did you dressed nice, did you do it classy? 

JERRY

Yeah, I started out real classy... 

GEORGE

Yeah you did, you classed it up! 

JERRY

But then I found out about the skin cancer. 

GEORGE

Oh, so it backfired? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

GEORGE

So, I guess I was lucky that I never tried that myself. 

ELAINE

Of course she treats skin cancer. That's how I met her, she was doing a skin cancer screening at Peterman. That's what dermatologists do. 

JERRY

Sadly, that knowledge could've help me. 

GEORGE

Wait a minute, she did a skin cancer screening at Peterman? 

ELAINE

Aha. 

GEORGE

Could she do that at Kruger? 

ELAINE

I don't know, I guess. 

GEORGE

So I set up a screening, everyone takes their shirt off and click, I snap me a shot of a bear-chested Kruger. 

ELAINE

You have a little thing for this fella'? 

GEORGE

Jerry, you gotta talk to Sitarides. 

JERRY

Yesterday you said I had to get my revenge on her! 

GEORGE

And that was wrong, Jerry! You simple must to apologize.. 

JERRY

Must I? 

GEORGE

Yes! Because it is the mature, adult thing to do. 

JERRY

How does that reflect me? 

KRAMER

Elaine, alright where's the SP2000? Cause I gotta slice. 

ELAINE

Aah, I forgot it. I gotta get home. 

KRAMER

Ok, I'll go with you. 

ELAINE

Umm, I'm not actually going straight to home, I have to first stop at the eh...circus, you know with all the...clowns. 

KRAMER

Oh, well you have fun...(Elaine leaves) oh no clowns...hate clowns...the clowns. 

JERRY

So again, I'm sorry. I had no right to yell at you, you're a life saving doctor and I'm just a comedian... 

SARA

Jerry, enough. I'll do your friend's cancer screening, because I believe in that, but as far as you and I are concerned; it's off. 

JERRY

Was it pimple popper MD? 

SARA

That's the one. (Taps Jerry on the cheek and leaves.) 

JERRY

Still got it. 

ELAINE

Out, damn heal! 

KRAMER

Elaine? 

ELAINE

Kramer? 

KRAMER

Yeah listen, I need my slicer back. 

ELAINE

Just hold on! 

KRAMER

Hey, what's going on? 

ELAINE

Nothing...(heal comes loose and Elaine opens the door.) Here, ok I'm on the phone alright? I'm on the phone with someone... 

KRAMER

My blade is all dinged up. Oh, come on! Elaine! 

ELAINE

Phone call! I'm in a big phone call! 

KRAMER

Come on, this is important! (Shakes the door handle and it comes loose. Kramer falls backwards to the next door.) 

NEIGHBOR

Hey, get the hell out of here! 

KRAMER

Wow, that's a lot of potatoes. 

KRAMER

So, George took my slicer down to Kruger and they're smoothing it out for me. 

JERRY

What the hell is this? 

KRAMER

Boy, that looks like an allergic reaction. Have you been wearing a fake beard? 

JERRY

No. 

KRAMER

Well, what have you been doing? 

JERRY

Nothing, I got up, run some errands, I went down to Sara's office and apologized... 

KRAMER

Whoa whoa, backup, Dr. Sitarides, what happened there? 

JERRY

Well, I tried to apologise, it didn't go over that well... 

KRAMER

There, there's your hives. 

JERRY

What, she gave me hives? 

KRAMER

Jerry, as the Bible says; Thou who cureth, can maketh ill. 

JERRY

She did kind of touch my face. 

KRAMER

Now you listen to me, you've got to find this woman and tell her that you're not a test tube pin cushion. 

JERRY

It does itch. Maybe I will go down at Kruger and talk to her. 

KRAMER

Alright, great, because I got to get down there and pick up my blade. Hey, and I couldn't find that stock room. 

ELAINE

Oh, that's fantastic. 

GEORGE

I just talked to Mr. Kruger, he'll be down in a minute. He wanted me to take a photograph for the record. 

SARA

What record? 

GEORGE

His personal file, I, I don't ask... 

SARA

Jerry? What brings you here? 

JERRY

I don't know, this? (Shows his neck to Sara.) 

SARA

Looks like hives. 

JERRY

Where do you suppose that could've come from? 

GEORGE

Jerry, what are you doing... 

KRAMER

He is just setting the record straight. 

JERRY

Come on Sitarides, cop to it. What brand of perverted science do you practice? 

SARA

Are you suggesting I somehow I infected you on purpose? 

JERRY

I want the antidote, pimple popper! 

SARA

That's it, I'm out of here! You're insane. 

JERRY

Am I? You touched my face. I didn't imagine that! 

GEORGE

Dr. Sitarides don't go! Oh, thanks Jerry! 

KRUGER

Hey George, hey Doc. We doing the screening here? 

GEORGE

Aah, yeah, yeah. Won't you head on in, we'll be in in a second. Be right with you. 

KRAMER

Doc, huh? 

GEORGE

Kramer, this is perfect. I need you to go in there, pretend you're a doctor and check this guy for moles. 

KRAMER

Moles, yes. Freckle's ugly cousin. 

GEORGE

And get a picture of him, with his shirt off. 

KRAMER

You really are cooking up a little scheme here, aren't you? 

GEORGE

Alright, lets get in there. Quick, quick, quick... 

ELAINE

This is it. I can take this anymore. 

KRAMER

Male mammal. Approximately 30 to 60 years of age. Weight...uh indeterminate. Ok, Mr. Kruger, we are gonna take a photo now for the records. So if you'll stand up please and give me a big smile, oh no no no, not that big. Yeah, that's nice, yes okay. Yes, let's have a looksee...ok, so eh, fiber from shirt on the left shoulder. I'm gonna have to keep my on that. 

KRUGER

How long have you been doing this Dr. Van Nostrand? 

KRAMER

Uuh, long long time. Yes, I've seen moles so big they have their own moles. Freckles that cover two men. 

KRUGER

So, how am I looking? 

KRAMER

Oh, so far, so good...(looks at Mr. Kruger's shoulder) yeuye... 

GEORGE

Kramer, I really owe you one. 

KRAMER

George, we got a problem. 

GEORGE

What? 

KRAMER

Well, he's got a mole on his shoulder. Very suspicious. 

GEORGE

So, tell him you're concerned about it and he should see someone else. 

KRAMER

George, why would I, a Juilliard trained dermatologist, send him to another doctor? 

GEORGE

Because, you're not a dermatologist. 

KRAMER

He thinks I am. I'm not gonna betray that trust. Here's what I wanna do; I think I can get a section... 

GEORGE

Whoa, whoa, a section?! 

KRAMER

Yeah, if I could crab my slicer and he'd hold still... 

GEORGE

No, you're not taking a deli slicer to my boss... 

KRAMER

It'll be operative thing, he would barely feel it. 

GEORGE

No! Absolutely Not! 

KRAMER

Well, it's my medical opinion, that you're making a big mistake. And it's going in my chart. 

ELAINE

Yeah, hello is this Allied Lock Smith?! Oh, finally, listen I need someone to come over here right away! 

NEIGHBOR

Turn it off! Turn it off! 

ELAINE

I am getting a lock smith, alright?! Relax! 

NEIGHBOR

Alright, that's it! 

ELAINE

Yeah, the address is 78th West... 

NEIGHBOR

Oh, oh mama... 

JERRY

So, Kramer pulled it off? 

GEORGE

Yep, and the photo was all fixed and back on his desk, no thanks to you. 

JERRY

Well, that woman had it coming to her. Look at my neck, it looks like I had a beard of bees! 

GEORGE

Why don't you see someone about it? 

JERRY

I've called everyone. You know how hard it is to get a dermatologist in this town? (Kramer comes in) A real dermatologist. 

KRAMER

(Points to a page on the book) Squamous cell carcinoma. 

GEORGE

You're not a doctor. You shouldn't even have books like this. 

KRAMER

George, that's what he has and I have to give him a call. Now we gotta came clean. 

GEORGE

You can't tell him the truth, you're gonna blow the whole thing. 

KRAMER

I don't want this on my conscience. 

GEORGE

I'll get him to see a real doctor. You just stay away from this. 

KRAMER

Yeah, alright... 

JERRY

Hey, I wonder if they have a picture of my rash in here. 

KRAMER

They've got everything there, Jerry. I underlined the best parts. 

JERRY

Hey, this looks like the thing I have. Caused by exposure to benzene, a common ingredient in metal cleaners. 

KRAMER

Well, that's weird. 

JERRY

What are you doing? 

KRAMER

Well, I'm cleaning my slicer. 

JERRY

That's my hand towel! I use that on my face, hands and chest! That's where the hives are coming from! It's not from Dr. Sitarides, it's from Dr. Van Nostrand! 

KRAMER

So, somehow the Bronzo (?) is reacting to the poison she's giving you. 

JERRY

Alright, get out. And take your Bronzo with you (throws the bottle to Kramer.) 

KRAMER

Ohh, that's toxic. (Jerry throws the towel over Kramer's head.) Ououou.... 

KRUGER

George, come in. I'm just going over our annual report...boy did we take it on the chin last year. 

GEORGE

Eh, listen Mr. Kruger, I got a message from Dr. Van Nostrand and he says it might be wise to you to see another doctor about that mole. 

KRUGER

I'm not too worried about it. 

GEORGE

Well, he said it could be cancer, maybe you should get it checked out. 

KRUGER

George, take a look at this photo. This is taken 10 years ago. That mole looks exactly as it does today. So, there's no cause for concern, eh? 

GEORGE

Whatever. 

KRUGER

Actually, funny thing about this photo. We were at the beach and there was this dumb looking guy near by. When he went in for a swim, my sons and I took all his stuff and threw it in the ocean! What a pear shaped loser. 

GEORGE

Well, that pear shaped loser was me! And I was in that photo, until I broke in here, stole the photograph and airbrushed myself out of there! 

KRUGER

Well, I'll be...you have lost a lot of hair. 

GEORGE

That's what they tell me! 

KRAMER

Do you want more pastrami? 

ELAINE

Um, what was that last thing you gave me? That was pretty good. 

KRAMER

Yeah, it was olive loaf. You want that? 

JERRY

I can't believe Kruger didn't fire you after all you did. 

GEORGE

He said he didn't care. Oh, God I love that place. Hey, have you seen other dermatologist? 

JERRY

Yeah, I finally got to see Dr. Kazarian. He said it was really bad. 

GEORGE

What did he give you for it. 

JERRY

Aloe. So where's that lock smith? 

GEORGE

Have to give him time on this hour. 

ELAINE

Can I have a zip? (Sticks a straw out from keyhole.) 

KRAMER

Oh yeah, coming up... 

GEORGE

So, Elaine, are you going to sleep with me or what?! 

ELAINE

(Aggravated) George, I just got off a twenty-three hour plane ride. I'm too tired to even vomit at the thought. 

GEORGE

(Angered) Fine. I'll ask you again when you're rested. 

JERRY

(Sarcastic) Oh, I'm sure she'll come around. 

GEORGE

Yeah, I hope so. For your sake! 

JERRY

(To George) I said I was sorry. 

GEORGE

You can stuff you sorries in a sack, mister! 

JERRY

(Nauseated at the saying) Would you please stop saying that?! 

KRAMER

(Confused) What is up with you two? 

GEORGE

I don't want to talk about it. 

KRAMER

(To Jerry) So how was the big trip? 

JERRY

I don't want to talk about it! 

KRAMER

(Observing Elaine's bandaged nose) Well, what happened to your nose? 

ELAINE

I don't want to talk ab-ow!-t it! (She winces under the pain from her nose on the word 'about') 

KRAMER

Well, you gotta give me something! Come on, how was the wedding? Was the bride radiant? 

ELAINE

She.. was. 

JERRY

'Till she found out Elaine slept with the groom. 

KRAMER

(Interested) Ooohh... That sounds juicy. Listen, I gotta go to the bathroom, but I want to hear all about it. (Gets up and heads for the bathroom) 

GEORGE

(While skimming a Monk's menu) You know, I didn't go to the bathroom the entire time we were in India. 

JERRY

I can't believe we went all the way to India for a wedding! 

ELLEN

That's it! The wedding's off. 

PINTER

What? But, Sue Ellen- 

ELLEN

(Cutting him off. To Elaine) Elaine, you were my maid of honor and you slept with MY Pinter?! 

ELAINE

No, no, no! It was years ago - before you met him. And, and I - I got to tell you.. it was very mechanical. 

ELLEN

I have never been so humiliated! 

ELAINE

(To Jerry and George) Idiots! This is all your fault! 

GEORGE

(While pointing at Jerry) Not me! Him! His fault! He betrayed me! 

JERRY

(Pleading) George, I'm sorry. 

GEORGE

Oh you can stuff your sorries in a sack, Mister! 

JERRY

(Confused) I don't know what that means. 

GEORGE

(To his girlfriend) Nina, you have to decide right now. Jerry or me? 

NINA

(Casually) Alright.. Neither. 

GEORGE

What?! Well, what are you doing here? 

NINA

A free trip to India. And by the way, you can take off those boots. Everyone knows you're five' six. 

GEORGE

Five' eight! Five' seven! 

ELAINE

(To Sue Ellen) See? See the way they are?! We're - we're still best friends, right? 

ELLEN

No. (Grabbing at the stud in Elaine's nose) And take that stupid thing out of your nose! 

JERRY

That's got to hurt, I don't care where you're from! 

GEORGE

(Whispering to Jerry) What time is our flight back? I got to go to the bathroom. 

ELAINE

(Whispering to Jerry) Hey. 

JERRY

Hey. 

ELAINE

What happened last night? 

JERRY

Oh, you were pretty loaded. 

ELAINE

(Gesturing to her nose stud) I know. I woke up with this. 

JERRY

Oh. Hello, Tetanus. 

NINA

George, I've used the bathroom. It's fine. 

GEORGE

(Struggling) No, no, no, no. I can walk it off. It's a hundred and twenty degrees in here.. I'll sweat it out. 

ELAINE

(Seeing George, she walks over to greet him) Hey. (Looking at his shoes) Are those Timberlands ... painted black? 

GEORGE

(Looking at her nose) Is your nose pierced? 

ELAINE

(Embarrassed) I should.. (Walks toward the bride and groom) 

GEORGE

Yeah. (Points to two open seats in front of Jerry's. To Nina) Sit down there. (Sees Jerry in the crowd) Hello, Jerry. (Obviously angered at Jerry) I believe you know Nina. 

JERRY

(As George sits down) George, we need to talk. 

GEORGE

(Trying to keep his voice down) I think you've done a lot more than talk! You betrayed me! 

JERRY

Alright, I admit it. I slept with Nina, but that's all. 

GEORGE

(Outraged) 'That's all'?! That's everything! I don't know what all the rest of it is for anyway! 

JERRY

(Pleading) I'm really sorry. 

GEORGE

You can stuff your sorries in a sack, mister! 

JERRY

(Confused) Where'd you get that one? 

GEORGE

It's an expression. 

ELAINE

(From the front of the room, she can hear George and Jerry's heated discussion) Hey! Shhhhh! (Crosses herself, then shakes her head - apologizing) 

GEORGE

(Trying to whisper to Jerry) Look, we are gonna settle this right now! I demand reparations! I should get to sleep with Elaine. That's the only way to punish you! 

JERRY

That doesn't punish me. It punishes Elaine! And cruelly, I might add. 

GEORGE

(Losing it) Funny guy! 

ELAINE

Hey! Monkeys! Knock it off. My best friend is trying to get married up here! 

GEORGE

Elaine, you have to sleep with me. 

ELAINE

(Definite) I'm not gonna sleep with you. 

GEORGE

Reparations! 

ELAINE

Would you grow up, George?! What is the difference? Nina slept with him (Points to Jerry), he slept with me, I slept with Pinter. Nobody cares! It's all ancient history. 

GEORGE

(Loud, so everyone at the wedding can hear) You slept with the groom?! 

KRAMER

Oh, thank you, FDR! All right, now we're even. 

FDR

I-I-I stuck a rock in there too. 

FDR

All right. 

KRAMER

Alright, FDR. This wish is for all the marbles. You win, you get your wish - I drop dead. I win, I don't drop dead, and I get one-hundred percent anti-drop-dead protection -- Forever. 

FDR

Alright. 

KRAMER

Oh, man! All right, come on. There's got to be something that'll change your mind, FDR. Something..' (FDR lifts up a cooler, and puts it on the table) What, you want my kidney? (FDR is smiling wickedly as he pulls a snowball out of the cooler) Mama!.. 

ELAINE

George knows that you slept with Nina. That's why he was acting so weird. 

JERRY

How did he find out? 

ELAINE

He schnapped me. 

JERRY

You know you're not supposed to drink while you're keeping a secret! (Elaine laughs) Is there anything else? 

ELAINE

I can't tell you. 

JERRY

(Handing her a small bottle) Here, drink this. 

ELAINE

Okay. (Takes a drink and wave Jerry to lean in) I slept with the groom. 

JERRY

Pinter? 

ELAINE

He used to be called Peter. 

JERRY

(Making nothing of it) So? Who cares about that? 

ELAINE

Sue Ellen! If she knew, she'd call off the whole wedding. 

JERRY

Oh, nobody's calling off any weddings. Alright, it's time to go. Come on.. Up. 

ELAINE

Do you know what 'Jerry' is in Indian? 

JERRY

(Carrying her out, piggy-back style) No, what? 

ELAINE

(Between laughs) Jugdish. 

JERRY

Yes, Jugdish. 

ELAINE

Hey, what if I got my, nose pierced? That would be pretty freaky.. Oooohhhhaaa! (sliding off Jerry onto the hallway floor) 

JERRY

(Trying to get rid of her) Yes, I think it's a fine idea. Well, good night. 

ELAINE

G'night, Jugdish. (Laughs) 

JERRY

Bless you. 

ELAINE

Thank you...aah, hm mm. 

KRAMER

ah, Hello FDR. Yeah, I'll have a hot one, (pulls out some cash and slaps down a bill on the stand) everything on it. 

FDR

These things'll kill ya... but so what...(squirts mustard on the hot dog)You're already gonna drop dead (grins) 

KRAMER

Well, guess what, FDR? I made a wish on a shooting star last night, and I wished, against your wish. 

FDR

That's funny. As it happens, I saw the same shooting star and double-wished you, to drop dead. (clicks out some coins from his changer and hands them to Kramer) Here's your change. 

KRAMER

Alright, I'm triple-wishing! Yep! 

FDR

(Throwing four coins into the fountain) Then I'm quadruple-wishing! 

KRAMER

Alright.. How do you like this? (Pulls out one of his eyebrows) Ya! 

FDR

I like it a lot. (Pulls out one of his eyebrows) Ow! (Blows it away) 

KRAMER

(Tears out another eyelash) Ah! (Blows it away) 

FDR

(Doing the same) Oh! (Blows it away) 

ELAINE

Oh, God, it's so hot! (Sniffing) What is that smell? 

JERRY

(Joking around) I think it's the stench of death. 

NINA

George, you've been wearing those boots since I met you. You're not gonna wear them to the wedding, are you? 

GEORGE

No (snorts - Laughing nervously)... I'm gonna wear black shoes. 

ELAINE

(Sees her enemy, Sue Ellen, at the airport) Oh boy. There's Sue Ellen. She didn't want me at this wedding, but here I am with a bunch of my idiot friends! 

JERRY

(Giddy) This is gonna be great! 

ELLEN

(Walking up to the group) Elaine? Oh! Oh, I am so happy to see you! 

ELAINE

(Confused by her reaction) You are? 

ELLEN

Well, of course! No one else was even willing to come to India. I mean, not even Pinter's parents - and they're Indian. 

ELAINE

Come on, Sue Ellen. You don't wear a bra, you're tall... we hate each other! 

ELLEN

Elaine, I know. I know we've had our problems, but.. I want you to be my maid of honor - and my best friend. 

ELAINE

(Toying with the idea) Huh.. alright. I guess. 

ELLEN

Uh, this is my fianc&eacute;, Pinter. (To Pinter) Say hello. 

PINTER

(Walking up to them) Hello. 

ELAINE

(Recognizing him) Peter? 

ELLEN

Uh, no. It's Pinter. Does anyone want to use the bathroom? 

GEORGE

(Leading Nina out the airport) Oh, no. No. We're good. Let's get goin'. Alright. (Almost bumps into Jerry) Watch it, funny man. (Leaves) 

JERRY

Elaine, have you noticed George was acting strange the whole flight? 

ELAINE

(Acting equally strange) No. What? Like what? What? Strange.. No. I.. 

JERRY

(Pulls a small bottle out of his pocket) Uh-huh. Hey, look what they had on the plane. Schnapps. 

ELAINE

Ooohh. 

KRAMER

Come on.. Come on. Yes! (Sees a falling star) There's one! (Yelling out) I wish I don't drop dead!! 

MAN

(Off-screen) Hey, shut up up there! 

KRAMER

You shut up! 

MAN

Aw, drop dead! 

GEORGE

Hello, friend. Enjoying the flight? 

JERRY

Coach to India - The only way to go. 

GEORGE

(Heavily sarcastic. He's angered at Jerry) Good one. Very funny. You're very funny, Jerry. That's what I always tell people. (Yelling out) Jerry Seinfeld's a funny guy! 

JERRY

You all right? 

GEORGE

Of course I'm all right. I'm here with my girl, Nina. And what better way to pass the time than gabbing with my best friend -- with whom there are no secrets. (Flashes two intertwined fingers) Like this. Since the fourth grade. 

JERRY

(Joking around) Hey, didn't I beat you up in the fourth grade? 

GEORGE

(Yelling out to the whole coach) Funny guy! (Points to Jerry) Right here! 

NINA

By the way, you never said anything to George about Jerry and me, did ya? 

ELAINE

Oh please.. It's in the vault. 

GEORGE

Ho, ha, ho! Jerry Seinfeld's a funny guy! 

ELAINE

Hey, what time is it? (she looks up and asks as Jerry walks in the aisle) 

JERRY

You just asked me two minutes ago. 

ELAINE

Hey, what time is it? 

JERRY

Ah, I'm not wearing a watch. 

ELAINE

Oh (quietly). Is this tooth chipped? (pointing to a tooth) 

JERRY

Yeah. How'd ya do that? 

ELAINE

I have no idea. 

ELAINE

Watch this. (Puts the bottle of Schnapps in her mouth, flips her head up, drinking it, then puts it back down with her teeth. She is effected by that last drink:) Oh.. God.. 

GEORGE

So, Jerry and Nina, huh? 

ELAINE

Oh, Mm mm.. (Scoots up close to George) I'm not gonna tell you, any - more - things. (points at George) 

GEORGE

You already told me everything. 

ELAINE

Okey-dokey. 

KRAMER

I mean, we had a deal, Newman. And you were supposed to give my your birthday wish. And now you've wasted it! 

NEWMAN

(With a gorgeous woman sitting on his lap) Did I? 

WOMAN

Newman, I'm bored. 

NEWMAN

Aww.. 

KRAMER

Does your girlfriend have to be here? 

NEWMAN

(Suggesting Jerry) Does yours? 

JERRY

(Giving Newman a sour look) I'm just hanging out in this hell-hole because of George. 

KRAMER

Alright, come on, Newman. Now you gotta help me! What am I gonna do about FDR? 

WOMAN

Why don't you just make another wish? 

KRAMER

And how am I gonna do that, Toots? 

WOMAN

What about a shooting star? 

KRAMER

(Interested) That's perfect. 

NEWMAN

(Kissing the woman) Beauty .. and brains. (they nuzzle noses) 

JERRY

(Disgusted. To the woman) Oh, come on. You know he's a postman, don't ya? 

ELAINE

Here's your plane ticket. 

JERRY

What are you talking about. 

ELAINE

Sue Ellen sends me an invitation, one week before her wedding in India. Tst, I'll show her... 

JERRY

By flying half way around the world? 

ELAINE

Spite Never sleeps (doing a little dance as she says it 

JERRY

Especially when you got a layover in Sarajevo. (Bosnia Herzegovina) 

GEORGE

Hey. 

ELAINE

(Handing George a ticket) Here. You're going to India with us tomorrow. 

GEORGE

For how long? 

ELAINE

Three days. 

GEORGE

Great. Jerry, I gotta tell you, I had the BEST TIME with that Nina last night. I - I think I'm in love with her already. You are a great friend. (Hugs Jerry) A great, great friend. 

JERRY

(Trying to change the subject away from Nina) Hey - Hey Kramer, what are you doing? You want to borrow something? You want to eat something? Come on in! 

KRAMER

(Shrugging Jerry off) Nah. 

ELAINE

You want to go to India? 

KRAMER

I can't. (Complaining) I'm gonna drop dead. 

GEORGE

Great! (snaps fingers and grabs the extra plane ticket) Nina could go, huh? Jerry, this is great. You and Elaine. Me and Nina. 

JERRY

H-Hey, Kramer, wait up. I'll go with you. 

KRAMER

I'm goin' to Newman's! 

JERRY

Great, I love Newman! (Eagerly following Kramer) 

GEORGE

(Asking Elaine) Jerry seem a little weird when I mentioned Nina? 

ELAINE

Nina? Nina? No. Psshhh.. Not weird. No. Nina. 

GEORGE

Why do you keep saying Nina? 

ELAINE

I don't know. Nina. Nina! (Feeling she's said to much, she goes to leave) I'm gonna go grab a bite. 

GEORGE

Uhh.. I'll- I'll meet you down there. 

KRAMER

(Knocking on a port-a-potty door) Come on, Lomez! We're gonna be late for the movie. 

NEWMAN

(To his new girlfriend) You see, my dear, all certified mail is registered, but registered mail is not necessarily certified. 

WOMAN

I could listen to you talk about mail all day. 

KRAMER

Anything you wish. I'll tell you a little secret about zip codes: They're meaningless! (Laughs evilly, driving away) 

KRAMER

Wish?! Newman! 

KRAMER

Lomez, I'm Leavin' 

ALL

(Singing to Newman) ..And you smell like one, too. (laughing and clapping) 

POSTMAN

Make a wish, Newman! We've gotta get back to work in three hours! 

KRAMER

Newman, wait! 

NEWMAN

(Stands up and Sputtering loudly) Kramer! I'm with people. 

KRAMER

Yeah, yeah. And thanks for inviting me! 

NEWMAN

I did invite you. Your invitation must've gotten ... lost in the mail. 

KRAMER

Well, Newman, I need your wish to protect me from FDR. 

NEWMAN

Can't do it. I'm on an unbelievable birthday-wish hot streak! My last five birthday wishes came true. 

KRAMER

Come on! Look, I'll give you my next birthday wish, huh? 

NEWMAN

(Negotiating) Your next, fifty wishes. 

KRAMER

Forty-eight. 

NEWMAN

Fourty-nine. 

KRAMER

Done! 

KRAMER

(Together) Sucker.. 

NEWMAN

Alright, alright, back, savages. Back! I haven't made my wish yet.. 

ELAINE

Well, Ahh, this Mischke mish-mash is just gettin' worse. 

JERRY

Uh-huh. 

ELAINE

I talked with the groom's parents.. 

JERRY

Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.. 

ELAINE

... And it's so obvious that they don't want.. 

JERRY

Uh-huh.. 

ELAINE

... me to go. 

JERRY

Sure. 

ELAINE

So, the only reason ... 

JERRY

Uh-huh. 

ELAINE

... she sent me an invitation was that so I'd send her a gift. 

JERRY

Uh-huh. 

NINA

(From Jerry's room) Jerry? 

JERRY

(To Elaine) Uh, well, you know, a coffee grinder is nice. Or a coffee maker. Everyone likes coffee. Anything to do with coffee. Maybe you should go get some coffee. 

NINA

Oh. Hi. 

ELAINE

Hi. 

NINA

(Getting ready to leave) Oh, I should... um... 

JERRY

Sure. 

NINA

Yeah. 

ELAINE

Bye-bye. 

NINA

Bye. (Leaves) 

ELAINE

(Gesturing back to the bedroom) Who else ya got back there? 

JERRY

Look, there was an awkward moment in the conversation. It never happened before. 

ELAINE

You slept with Nina? What are you gonna tell George? 

JERRY

Nothing. And neither will you. George can never know about this.. It'll crush him. 

ELAINE

Uh. Alright, alright. I'll put it in the vault. 

JERRY

No good. Too many people know the combination. 

ELAINE

(Confused) What combination? 

ELAINE

Don't be ridiculous. 

JERRY

Oh my god. This drawer is filled with Fruit Loops! 

ELAINE

So what? 

JERRY

And milk. 

KRAMER

Oh, geez.. 

JERRY

(From outside the apartment) Hello? 

ELAINE

Hi. Mr. and Mrs. Ranawat? 

ZUBIN

Please, call us Usha and Zubin. 

ELAINE

Oh. Well, Usha. 

ZUBIN

I'm Zubin. 

ELAINE

(Shrugging it off) Anyway, your son is marrying my friend, Sue Ellen Mischke. 

USHA

You're not going to the wedding, are you? 

ELAINE

Well ... 

USHA

Don't go. India is a dreadful, dreadful place. 

ZUBIN

You know, it's the only country that still has the plague? (laughing as he says the line) I mean, the plague! Please! 

USHA

Here's the registry. Send her a gift, and be glad you did not have to go. 

ELAINE

(Soaking it in) Right. Don't go. Send a gift. I think I understand. 

ZUBIN

If I had to go to India, I wouldn't go to the bathroom the entire trip. 

ELAINE

(Leaving) That's fantastic. 

ZUBIN

And I'm not so crazy about Manhattan, either. 

NINA

Oh, you were going to tell me all about George. 

JERRY

Ah, just remember when you see him tomorrow night to tell him that the waiter liked him. 

NINA

Really? 

JERRY

Believe me. You know, I forgot how much fun it is hanging out with you. 

NINA

I know. You know, we never had a bad conversation. 

JERRY

I know. No awkward pauses. Probably the reason we never fooled around.. 

NINA

Heh.. yeah. 

JERRY

Probably the reason.. 

FDR

Are - are you dense? I said I wanted you to drop dead. Now.. drop dead! (Slams the door in Kramer's face *Note: FDR's Apt. #548*) 

KRAMER

(Walking away) I knew it.. Stupid Jerry.. 

JERRY

Kramer, I know what I'm talking about. There's no way FDR wants you to drop dead. 

KRAMER

But you haven't seen.. 

JERRY

Just go back and ask him again. (Slams the door on Kramer) 

KRAMER

Yeah.. (Heads for FDR's) 

FDR

That's right. My birthday wish was that you drop dead. 

KRAMER

Well, why? 

FDR

(Sinister) I have my reasons. 

KRAMER

Woah, wait, wait, wait. If you make a birthday wish out loud, it doesn't come true. 

FDR

That's just a silly superstition. (Slams his door on Kramer) 

KRAMER

Hey, FDR wants me to drop dead. 

GEORGE

FDR? 

KRAMER

(To George) Yeah, Franklin Delano Romanowski. (Resumes telling the story) I go to his birthday part, and just before he blew out his candles, he gives me this look.. 

GEORGE

(Guessing the look) Stink eye? 

JERRY

(Also guessing) Crook eye? 

KRAMER

EVIL, eye. 

JERRY

Well, everybody's a little cranky on their birthday. 

GEORGE

Oh, it's a bad day. Uh, you got everyone in your house, you're thinkin', 'These are my friends?!' 

JERRY

Everyday is my birthday. (Sarcastically joking off what George said) 

KRAMER

Yeah, well, I can't have this hanging over my head. It's bad mojo. 

ELAINE

Hi. 

ELAINE

You're not gonna believe what I got in the mail. Invitation to Sue Ellen Mischke's wedding. 

JERRY

(Joking about the bra-less wonder) Well, at least the wedding gown will give her some support. 

ELAINE

Not the point. The wedding is in one week. I got this (Holds up invitation) today. 

JERRY

So you think it's a non-vite? 

ELAINE

It's an un-vitation! (Notices George is a few inches higher) Hey, are you gettin' taller? 

GEORGE

Timberlands. (Showing Elaine his boots) 

ELAINE

Ah. (Looking at the invitation) Hey, look at this. 'Pinter Ranawat'.. I wonder if he's related to that guy I dated, Peter Ranawat.. 

JERRY

Ah, it's probably like Smith over there. 

GEORGE

Jerry, would you make the call already? 

ELAINE

What call? 

JERRY

He wants me to set him up with this girl, Nina Stengal. 

ELAINE

(Remembers Jerry's talking about her) Oh, the great conversation girl. (Somewhat bitter toward Jerry) The one you think can replace me? 

JERRY

I was kidding when I said that! 

GEORGE

(To Elaine) Told me the same thing. 

JERRY

(On the phone) Nina, Hi. It's Jerry. 

GEORGE

You-you sure you never slept with her? (Jerry shakes his head 'no') Perfect. 

JERRY

(To Nina) Hey, how 'bout my friend, George? Quite a guy, huh? 

GEORGE

(Rubbing his stomach) Ooh.. Something's not sitting right.. 

GEORGE

I'll have the Clams Casino. 

JERRY

Get outta here. 

GEORGE

(Showing Jerry the menu) 'Chef recommends' 

JERRY

Hmm.. 

GEORGE

(Motioning toward waitress) I think she likes me. 

JERRY

Sure. 

GEORGE

So, how come nothing ever happened between you and Nina? (Getting paranoid) Is there a problem with her? Is she a man? 

JERRY

Are you? 

GEORGE

Well, what's the reason? 

JERRY

We were too compatible Our conversations were so engrossing. 

GEORGE

How engrossing? 

JERRY

If we ever had a problem with Elaine, we could bring in Nina and not lose a step. 

GEORGE

Wow! Heh. (Half kidding) You don't, huh, have a replacement lined up for me, do ya? heh he he he he he... 

JERRY

Anyway, like I was saying, I couldn't make the transition from conversation to sex. There were no awkward pauses... I need an awkward pause. 

GEORGE

I'm all for awkward pauses. Fix me up with her.. Wait a minute, Nina just saw me in my Timberlands! Now I have to wear them every time I see her. 

JERRY

Why? 

GEORGE

In any other shoe, I lose two inches. I - I can't have a drop down. We were eye to eye, I can't go eye to chin! 

JERRY

So, you're gonna wear 'em no matter what the situation? 

GEORGE

In every situation. No matter how silly I look. (Tastes his Clams Casino) Hm.. tastes a little funky. 

JERRY

Oh, I'm sure it's fine. 

ALL

..to you! 

MAN

Come on, make a wish! Make a wish! 

KRAMER

Yeah! 

ALL

Heyyy, yeahhhh (Clapping). 

GEORGE

Ah, this is the kind of day that almost makes you feel good to be alive. 

JERRY

Almost. (Notices his shoes) Hey, new Timberlands? 

GEORGE

Yeah, and a whole new me. I'm up two inches in these babies! 

JERRY

Really? 

GEORGE

Five' eight. Five' seven. 

NINA

Jerry? 

JERRY

Nina? 

NINA

Hi. 

JERRY

It's been years! 

NINA

Yeah! 

JERRY

(Introducing the two) George, this is Nina. 

GEORGE

Nice to meet you. 

NINA

Nice to meet you, too. 

ELAINE

(Reading an invitation) India? Tst, Yeah, right. (Sarcastic) I'm goin' to India.. 

NINA

And they call it the World Wide Web. You can e-mail anyone! 

JERRY

(Mesmerized) What are you, a scientist?! 

NINA

Ah, I gotta go. (Gets up to leave) 

JERRY

Ah. 

NINA

It's great talkin' 

JERRY

Great talkin' to you. (Nina leaves. To himself) What the hell is e-mail? 

GEORGE

How as the date? 

JERRY

Pretty good. I think she might be the one. 

SUSAN

No. 

GEORGE

Whooo.. (To a waitress taking orders) Ooh.. French fries. 

SUSAN

Ah, George. 

GEORGE

(clearing his throat, he changes his order for Susan) Baked, uh, potato. 

SUSAN

Uh-huh. 

GEORGE

Sorry. 

SUSAN

Yeah, you stuff your sorries in a sack, mister. 

KRAMER

Hey, hey. Yeah, check it out. It's packin' tight! (Puts the snowball on the table, then drips water from Jerry's cup onto it) 

JERRY

What are you bringing snowballs in here for? 

KRAMER

Oh, I need some water. Ice it up nice and hard ... and when you throw it - Pop! Oh look, (FDR is at the cash register, pays and leaves Monk's) there's my friend, FDR. I'm gonna nail him in the back of the head. It's gonna be great! (Rushes out of Monks to peg his friend with the snowball) 

JERRY

Hi, Elaine. 

GEORGE

Hey! 

ELAINE

(Turning around and leaving with Pinter) Hey, let's go someplace else, Okay, Peter? 

KRAMER

Oh, hey, how you doing? 

JERRY

Oh, hi. I-I'm Jerry Seinfeld. I'm movin' in. I saw your name on the buzzer - You must be Kessler. 

KRAMER

Uh, no. Actually, it's Kramer. 

JERRY

Oh. 

KRAMER

Uh, you need any help, or..? 

JERRY

No, thanks. But I ordered a pizza. You want some of it? 

KRAMER

Ah, no, no, no. I-I couldn't impose. 

JERRY

Why not? We're neighbors. What's mine is yours. (And with that, Jerry made the most fatal mistake of his life) 

KRAMER

(quietly) Ohh (Eyeing Jerry's empty apartment) Really? 

JERRY

(tapping the spatula while waiting for waffles to be done) Any second now. Light is on! Melissa, waffles are ready. 

MELISSA

(appearing in the kitchen stark naked) Oh, fantastic! I'm starving. 

JERRY

(looking at her) How about that. 

MELISSA

(eating the waffles) Mmm-hmm. 

GEORGE

She ate breakfast naked? 

JERRY

She didn't even want a napkin. 

GEORGE

I've had bedroom naked, I've had walk-to-the-bathroom naked... I have never had living-room naked. 

JERRY

Oh, it's a scene. 

GEORGE

It's like you're livin' in the Playboy Mansion! Did she, uh, did she frolic? 

JERRY

I don't really have enough room. 

GEORGE

(seeing Elaine and Puddy come into Monk's) Yeah. Hey, Lainie, Puddy. 

ELAINE

Hey! 

PUDDY

Hi. 

JERRY

Hey. 

PUDDY

(heading towards the bathroom) I got to make a pit stop. 

ELAINE

(sitting down in the booth) 'Kay. 

JERRY

Back together? 

ELAINE

His apartment was being fumigated, so we thought we'd give it another shot. 

JERRY

Ah... 

ELAINE

So guess who called me last night? Jason Hanke. 

GEORGE

'Stanky Hanke'? What did he want? 

ELAINE

He called to apologize for standing me up five years ago. 

JERRY

Why now? 

ELAINE

A.A. It's one of the Twelve Steps. Step number Nine is you have to apologize to anyone you've ever wronged. 

GEORGE

Ho ho ho ho! I can't wait for Hanke to come crawling back to me. 

JERRY

Still with the neck hole? 

GEORGE

Still upset. Very upset. 

ELAINE

What neck hole? 

GEORGE

Remember that New Year's party he threw a few years ago? He had that very drafty apartment, you know, I think on Ninth Avenue. 

GEORGE

I asked if I could borrow a sweater. 

JERRY

A cashmere sweater. 

GEORGE

I said preferably cashmere, for warmth. So in front of the whole party, he says, 'No. I don't want you stretching out the neck hole.' 

ELAINE

Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! 

GEORGE

Oh, yeah, sure, laugh it up. Everybody else did! 

ELAINE

Well, it's funny. I mean, you have a big head. Or is it 'cause of your neck? 

JERRY

No, I think the head does most of the stretching. 

GEORGE

Regardless. I had to walk around for the rest of the party in some cheap Metlife windbreaker. Now, it is payback time. 

ELAINE

I really think it's the size of your neck. 

GEORGE

It's my head! 

ELAINE

Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! 

ELAINE

Hey. 

PEGGY

Hey. 

ELAINE

Isn't this great? With those nerds in accounting moved, you and I are the only ones who use this bathroom. 

PEGGY

(somewhat sarcastically) Yeah. Great. 

KRAMER

You went to the coffee shop without me? I told ya, I just wanted to hop in the shower. 

JERRY

That was an hour ago. What were you doing in there? 

KRAMER

Showering. How long does it take you? 

JERRY

Ten minutes. 

KRAMER

(seeing Elaine come into Jerry's apartment) Ten minutes? That's kooky talk. Hey Elaine, how long do you spend in the shower? 

ELAINE

Ten minutes. 

KRAMER

Let me smell you. 

ELAINE

All right. Whiff away. 

KRAMER

(after delicately sniffing Elaine) Uh... that's not bad at all. 

ELAINE

(holding Kramer off from getting another whiff) Hup! That's it. 

KRAMER

(backing off) OK. 

ELAINE

So get this. I'm in the bathroom at work today, and I see Peggy using a seat protector. 

JERRY

So? 

ELAINE

So... we're the only women on the floor. I mean, we're like roommates. Would-would you use a seat protector if you had a roommate? 

JERRY

(seeing Kramer struggle to open a soda, spilling it all over) I think the damage is probably already done. (interrupting Kramer's inadequate attempt to clean up the soda) All right! I'll get that. Well, maybe she just practices good hygiene. 

ELAINE

(eyeing Jerry meticulously cleaning up the soda) Yeah, you're probably right. She's probably one of those neurotic clean freaks. 

JERRY

Mmm. 

KRAMER

Well, here's my shower routine. Maybe I can make some changes. Get wash cloth mittens and maybe some liquid soap, and just... -pop- focus! 

JERRY

(playing Scrabble with his naked girlfriend) Zephyr? That is not a word. 

MELISSA

Do you challenge? 

JERRY

No, I do not challenge. 

MELISSA

66 points. Ha ha. 

JERRY

I'd accuse you of cheating, but I don't know where you'd hide the tiles. 

MELISSA

You want some more ice tea? 

JERRY

Sure. 

MELISSA

(coughing loudly, while Jerry's expression turns to disgust) Wrong pipe. 

GEORGE

So she coughed. 

JERRY

Coughing... naked... It's a turn-off, man. 

GEORGE

Everything goes with naked. 

JERRY

When you cough, there are thousands of unseen muscles that suddenly spring into action. It's like watching that fat guy catch a cannonball in his stomach in slow motion. 

GEORGE

Oh, you spoiled, spoiled man. Do you now how much mental energy I expend just trying to picture women naked? 

JERRY

But the thing you don't realize is that there's good naked and bad naked. Naked hair brushing, good; naked crouching, bad. Hey, there's Hanke. 

GEORGE

All right. It's grovel time. 

HANKE

Hey, George. Jerry. Listen, I just got sober, so I've been going through the Twelve Steps. 

GEORGE

What are you up to now, uh, Step Nine? 

HANKE

Yeah. Making amends. 

GEORGE

Important step. Maybe the most important. 

HANKE

Anyway, uh, Jerry, you know, this may sound dumb, but, you know, when we first met I thought your name was Gary. And, I think I may even have called you Gary a couple of times, and... I don't know if you noticed, but I always felt bad about it, so, I'm sorry. 

JERRY

Thank you. I did notice, and I appreciate you rectifying it. 

HANKE

(eyeing George, who's looking expectedly up at him) Great. Great. Well, I'll see you guys later. 

KRAMER

(enters) Well, I just got out of a 27-minute shower. I made some good cuts, and I didn't lose anything I needed. Yeah, I think what I kept is even stronger now. 

JERRY

(pointing to Kramer's hair) You got some suds over here. 

KRAMER

(noticing suds all over his clothes and body) Wha...? Oh, man! Geez! Look at that! I'm all lathery. Jerry, you got to show me what I'm doing wrong. 

JERRY

Oh, come on! 

KRAMER

No, I mean it, man. I'm lost! 

JERRY

You promise you'll never come in here again? 

KRAMER

(chuckling) Oh, Jerry, you know I can't do that. 

JERRY

(standing in the bathtub) Now my sense of it is that you're probably wasting time working piecemeal, first cleaning one area, then another. 

KRAMER

Well, that's how cats do it. 

JERRY

But, when you have a faucet instead of a tongue, you want to use gravity. 

KRAMER

OK. Let's turn the water on now. 

JERRY

No, I told you, it's just a dry run. 

GEORGE

(entering Jerry's bathroom) Well, Hanke's moved on to Step Ten. He was spotted taking personal inventory. 

JERRY

That's Step Ten? 

GEORGE

All he has to do now is count his blessings, say a prayer, and he's done. Do you believe this? 

KRAMER

Come on, Jerry. How about a-a baggy swimsuit? 

JERRY

You're not gettin' any skin, Kramer. 

KRAMER

Well, this has all been one big tease! 

ELAINE

(moving Peggy's water to make room for paper on the desk) These proofs look pretty good. Oh. Can I move this? Yup. I think this will work. 

PEGGY

(having seen Elaine touch her nearly full water bottle) I'm... gonna get another bottle of water. 

WALTER

(taking a final swig from his own water bottle) Here, take mine. There's a little left. 

PEGGY

(gulping down Walter's water) Oh, thanks, Walter. Ahh! 

HANKE

(talking with two men in Monk's) Guys, there's no doubt that the pay is good. But I don't just know if I see myself working with ice cream. 

HANKE

I don't know if I'm into that. 

GEORGE

(entering Monk's) Oh, hello, Hanke, others. 

HANKE

George. 

GEORGE

You know, Jason, I, uh, I couldn't help notice, I... I didn't get my apology. 

HANKE

Apology? For what? 

GEORGE

A drafty apartment? A... sweaterless friend? A ball-game giveaway Metlife windbreaker? 

HANKE

George, come on, not that neck hole thing. 

GEORGE

Yeah, the neck hole thing, and I would appreciate it if you would say you're sorry. 

HANKE

No way, you would've completely stretched it out. 

GEORGE

You're an alcoholic! You have to apologize. Step Nine! Step Nine. 

HANKE

All right, George, all right. I'm sorry. I'm very, very sorry. I'm so sorry that I didn't want your rather bulbous head struggling to find its way through the normal-size neck hole of my finely knit sweater. 

KRAMER

(taking notes on showering men at the YMCA) Now see, that's smart. Constant motion. Wow. 

SHOWER

(seeing Kramer staring at the showering man) Hey! 

KRAMER

Oh, yeah, yeah, I-I'm watching you, too. But this guy's really showing me something! 

KRAMER

(walking into Jerry's apartment with a fresh black eye) You got a steak? 

JERRY

What happened to you? 

KRAMER

Ah, people in this city are crazy. 

JERRY

(giving him a steak from the fridge) Here ya go. 

KRAMER

(applying the steak to his eye) Thanks, buddy. Oh... yes! Hey, you got any A1, 'cause I'm cooking a steak. 

JERRY

What? 

KRAMER

Yeah, a different one. 

JERRY

(closing the door on him) Oh! 

KRAMER

Jerry! 

MELISSA

(wheeling out Jerry's bicycle) OK, Jerry. I fixed that bike. 

JERRY

Oh. That wasn't really necessary. I don't ride it. It's just for show. 

MELISSA

(crouching down next to the bike) I should really clean those bearings. Hold this. Look at all that gunk. 

JERRY

Please don't crouch. 

MELISSA

Ouch! Caught my skin. 

JERRY

Oh, that's bad. Especially that area. 

MELISSA

You got anything to snack on? 

JERRY

Uhh... 

MELISSA

(grabbing the pickle jar and straining to open it) Oh, pickles! Unnhhhh! It's a tough one. 

JERRY

Look, please stop! Let me help you with that! 

MELISSA

(finally opening the jar) Unnnnh! Oooh. That's gonna leave a welt. Look at that. 

JERRY

(leaving the room) I can't. I can't look anymore. I-I-I've seen too much. 

ELAINE

Peggy, we've got to talk. What is it about me that you find so offensive? 

PEGGY

You seem to be with a lot of men. 

ELAINE

What!? I happen to have a very steady boyfriend. You know, I mean, we broke up a few times and there has been an occasional guy here or... or there, but, wh-why is this your business? 

PEGGY

It's not. Good day. 

ELAINE

(leaving the room after rubbing Peggy's keyboard on her butt, sticking the stapler in her armpit, and coughing on her doorknob) Oh. All right. You think I've got germs? I'll give you some germs. How about some for your keyboard, huh? Huh? Oooh, how about for your stapler. Hmmm? That's good, isn't it? You have a happy and a healthy. 

JERRY

Well, technically he did apologize. 

GEORGE

Jerry, I felt like a straight man in some horrible sketch. He was riffing! Riffing! On my pain! 

JERRY

So now you want an apology for the apology, plus the original apology? 

GEORGE

That's right. I'm two in the hole! 

JERRY

Well, I hit the wall yesterday with Lady Godiva. She did a full body flex on a pickle jar. 

GEORGE

Did you explain to her about the good naked and the bad naked? 

JERRY

Where am I gonna get a fat guy and a cannonball? 

GEORGE

Well... what if you showed up bad naked, huh? You still got that belt sander? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

GEORGE

(going into the bathroom) Well, you on all fours, that thing vibratin', kickin' up sawdust, ho ho! She'll get the picture! 

JERRY

(answering the ringing phone) Hello? 

KRAMER

Hey, Jerry, guess where I'm calling from! 

JERRY

World War I plane? 

KRAMER

No, I'm in my shower. Well, you know, I'm trying to get out of the shower sooner, and then I ask myself, 'Why?' I mean this is where I want to be. So I got a waterproof phone, I shaved, I brushed my teeth, and now I ordered a pair of chinos from J. Crew. 

JERRY

When are ya gettin' out? 

KRAMER

I'm not! I'll see ya later, buddy. 

PETERMAN

Bad news, people. Peggy is home sick. 

ELAINE

Oh, please. 

PETERMAN

She's stuffed up, achy, and suffering from intense malaise. 

ELAINE

Oh, come on, we all have intense malaise. Right? 

PETERMAN

I just spoke with her, Elaine. She's in bed. 

ELAINE

Yeah, let me tell you something: this is all in her mind, OK? She is insane. She thinks I made her sick because I coughed on her doorknob, rubbed her stapler in my armpit, and put her keyboard on my butt. Yeah, she's a wacko. 

GEORGE

So you're Jason Hanke's supervisor? 

SPONSOR

Sponsor. 

GEORGE

Whatever. Listen, I'm very concerned about this guy. 

SPONSOR

He's doing very well. He's already on to Step Ten. 

GEORGE

Yeah, well when you don't actually do the steps, you can go through them pretty quick. You can get through six a day. 

SPONSOR

Is there some unresolved issue between you and Jason? 

GEORGE

I don't know. A little thing called Step Nine? Instead of an apology, he was beboppin' and scattin' all over me. 

SPONSOR

I'm not sure what you want me to do. 

GEORGE

Well, aren't you the boss of him? You shouldn't let him move up! When I was in the Cub Scouts, I got stuck on Weebolos for three years 'cause I kept losing the Pinewood Derby. 

SPONSOR

You're quite upset, George. 

GEORGE

Well, I think you should drop him down to Step Two. 

SPONSOR

Admit there's a higher power? 

GEORGE

Yeah, let him chew on that for a while. 

GEORGE

All right. That's more like it. Thank you very much. (giving the sponsor the 'be strong' hand clench) By the way, my uncle was an alcoholic, so... 

KRAMER

(on the phone in the shower) Lomez, you're not listenin'. Jerry likes the naked, just some of the things she does when she's naked. Calm down, I'm on your side. Geez. Hey, hold on a second. I got a clog, I'll call ya back. 

MELISSA

(naked on the couch) What are you doing? 

JERRY

(naked, carrying a belt sander) I found a rough spot on the kitchen floor, I thought I'd polish it up with this belt sander I have here. 

MELISSA

No, not that. Why are you naked? 

JERRY

I thought naked is good. 

MELISSA

(eyeing him) This isn't good naked. 

SPONSER

George, here, have a seat. 

GEORGE

(sitting down) Where's Hanke? 

SPONSER

(motioning to the leader) Shhhhh. 

LEADER

OK, let's get started. Welcome to Rage-aholics Anonymous. 

GEORGE

What? Rate-aholics? 

SPONSER

George, this can help you. 

GEORGE

Hey, I am not here for rage. I'm here for revenge. 

LEADER

Excuse me. We have a 'no yelling' policy at these meetings. 

GEORGE

Excuse me. Am I talking to you, Pinhead? Am I?! 

LEADER

Please don't call me 'Pinhead'. 

GEORGE

I'm losin' it! 

JERRY

He took you to Rage-aholics? Why? 

GEORGE

Probably because this whole Universe is against me! 

JERRY

You've got a little rage. 

GEORGE

I know. And now they want me to bottle it up. It makes me so mad! 

JERRY

By the way, my bad naked demo didn't quite work. 

GEORGE

This bread has nuts in it! 

JERRY

(seeing Elaine enter Monk's) Oh, great. Elaine. What is wrong with my body? 

ELAINE

Chicken wing shoulder blades. 

JERRY

That's it? 

ELAINE

No, but that's one problem. Why? 

JERRY

Well, I was walking around naked in front of Melissa the other day-- 

ELAINE

Whoa! Walking around naked? Ahh... that is not a good look for a man. 

GEORGE

Why not? It's a good look for a woman. 

ELAINE

Well, the female body is a... work of art. The male body is utilitarian, it's for gettin' around, like a jeep. 

JERRY

So you don't think it's attractive? 

ELAINE

It's hideous. The hair, the... the lumpiness. It's simian. 

GEORGE

Well, some women like it. 

ELAINE

Hmm. Sickies. 

KRAMER

(in the shower, reading an instruction manual) Installing your Clarkman garbage disposal. Dismantle latch hasp beneath main drainage lot. Oh, come on, Clarkman. 

PUDDY

(staring into space, picks up the phone) Puddy. 

KRAMER

Is, uh, David Puddy there? 

PUDDY

This is Puddy. 

KRAMER

Well, this is Kramer. 

PUDDY

I know. 

KRAMER

Um, listen, you're a mechanic. Could you help me install a garbage disposal? 

PUDDY

Well, it's a big job. You've got to dismantle the latch hasp from the auxiliary drainage line. 

KRAMER

No. It says 'main line'. 

PUDDY

It's a misprint. What do you got, a Clarkman? 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

PUDDY

(seeing Elaine come in) Hey, man, I'll call you back. I'll talk you through it. 

KRAMER

Oh, OK. Well, thanks, buddy. 

ELAINE

Hey, Puddy. 

PUDDY

Hey, Babe, your boss called. You owe five bucks for a balloon bouquet. Yeah, he says you can just give it to him tomorrow when you see him. 

ELAINE

Balloon bouquet? For who? 

PUDDY

Peggy took a turn for the worst. 

ELAINE

Peggy. Oh, great. I suppose she's still blaming me? 

PUDDY

That's what he said. 

ELAINE

I don't believe this woman. 

PUDDY

Talk to me, Babe. 

ELAINE

She's this crazy woman who is convinced that my germs make her sick. 

PUDDY

Oh, germ-o-phobe. I know what that's about. 

ELAINE

Huh? 

PUDDY

(showing her his necklace) I'm a recovering germ-o-phobe. Ten years. 

ELAINE

What is this symbol? 

PUDDY

It's a germ. 

PEGGY

Elaine, it was very nice of you to bring the man you're currently sleeping with over to talk to me, but I assure you, I don't have any problem with germs. 

PUDDY

Don't you? Elaine. 

PEGGY

(flinching away) Please! 

PUDDY

I know it looks bleak. I've been there. Ten years ago waking up in bed next to a woman like this would've sent me running for the Phisohex. 

PEGGY

Really? 

PUDDY

I still have trouble looking at those disgusting old bedroom slippers she slogs around in. 

ELAINE

Hey, I've had those since college. They're bunnies. 

PUDDY

They're bacteria traps. 

PEGGY

So you... just learned to live with it? 

PUDDY

For the most part. 

ELAINE

OK, we're broken up for the rest of the day. 

JERRY

So I'm glad we had a talk and worked this out. Don't you feel this is better? 

MELISSA

This is nice. 

JERRY

Yes, clothes. This is normal. 

MELISSA

Hey, what are you doing tomorrow? I was thinking that we could go down... 

MELISSA

Jerry? Jerry, are you listening to me? 

JERRY

Oh... yeah. What? I'm sorry. 

MELISSA

I wanted to know what you're doing tomorrow. 

JERRY

Oh, maybe a haircut, and, I don't know, maybe a... 

KRAMER

(in the shower, on the phone with Jerry) So you broke up? 

JERRY

We couldn't carry on a conversation. I kept trying to picture her naked, she kept trying to not picture me naked. 

KRAMER

Hang on. 

JERRY

So what are you up to? 

KRAMER

Oh, just cooking up a little thank you for Puddy. Hey, how do you make those radish roses? 

JERRY

Insert a knife into the center and twist. Then, to make it bloom, soak it in water for thirty to forty minutes. 

KRAMER

No problem there. 

HANKE

George. Thanks for coming down to talk to me. I wanted to see you right away, but my hours here aren't very flexible. I just started yesterday. 

GEORGE

Well, I'm here. What is it? 

HANKE

Well, I talked to my sponsor, and, uh, I've thought it over, and, you know, my apology at the coffee shop was sarcastic, and rude, and you deserve much better. 

GEORGE

(ready to leave) Well, thank you. 

HANKE

You're welcome. 

KID

(entering the store) Can I get a Triple Minute Man Mint? 

HANKE

Waffle or sugar cone? 

GEORGE

Uh, excuse me, uh, um, Jason. I don't want to get into a big thing here, but... I'm not sure if, technically, what you just said was actually an apology. 

HANKE

What? 

KID

Can you get on that cone? 

HANKE

Would you hang on just a second, son? George, what are you talking about? 

GEORGE

Well, it's just, all you said was 'your welcome', which is nice. It's very nice. But... I feel I gotta get the apology. 

KID

Is there anybody else here but you? 

HANKE

I'm alone, and it's my second day. You know, I don't even think we have that flavor so... George, really, enough, ok? You know, I-I admitted I was wrong, so what more do you want from me? 

GEORGE

I would like an apology. 

HANKE

All right, look, you know-- 

KID

No, this guy doesn't know what he's doing. 

HANKE

Oh, yes I do. Yes, I do. OK? I'm interacting with someone here, if you can understand that. Now, I'm sorry. 

GEORGE

Baah! There it is! You just said it! That's what I want! Now say it again, and tell it to me. 

HANKE

I'm not saying anything to you. I'm not sorry. I was never sorry. It was cashmere. I hate Step Nine! Where's that Rum Raisin? Where is it? Can't find anything. I need a drink. Ah, daquiri ice. Here we go. What are you looking at? Get out! Come on, can't you see we're closed?! Get out! 

ELAINE

(eating dinner with Kramer, Elaine, and Puddy) Mmm. This food is fantastic, PEGGY: And what a pretty radish rose, huh? 

KRAMER

Well, thank you. 

ELAINE

Here's to Peggy, on her first week of being germ-free, free. 

KRAMER

Yeah. And here's to David Puddy for helping me install a much needed and much appreciated garbage disposal in my bathtub. 

PEGGY

You have a garbage disposal in your bathtub? 

KRAMER

Oh, yeah, and I use it all the time. Yeah, I made this whole meal in there. 

ELAINE

This food was in the shower with you? 

KRAMER

Mm-hmm. I prepared it as I bathed. 

PUDDY

Oh, germs. Germs. Germs! 

GEORGE

Excuse me. Is this, uh, Rage-aholics? 

PUDDY

(waiting with Elaine and Peggy) No, germ-o-phobes. 

GEORGE

Thanks. What are you guys doin' here? 

ELAINE

Kramer. 

GEORGE

Right. 

HANKE

(speaking in front of other Rage-aholics) Hi, I'm, uh, Jason. I'm a rage-aholic. 

AUDIENCE

Hi, Jason. 

HANKE

Uh, this is my first meeting. 

GEORGE

Step-skipper. That man is a step-skipper! He skips Step Nine! 

HANKE

Please. Step Nine. 

GEORGE

That's right! He never apologized to me for saying that I would stretch out the neck hole of his sweater. 

GEORGE

It wasn't funny. 

HANKE

It was a very nice sweater. Take a look at his neck, not to mention the melon sitting on top of it. I don't know if I'd trust him with a v-neck. 

GEORGE

He's beboppin' and scattin', and I'm losin' it! 

ELAINE

So.. Whatley's still Jewish, huh? 

JERRY

Oh, sure. With out the parents, it's a breeze. 

TIM

Hey! Happy Chanukah! 

JERRY

Hey, Tim. Great party. 

TIM

(Suggesting a kiss to Elaine) eh? 

ELAINE

(Shrugging it off) eh. 

TIM

(Accepting) Oh. (Turns to George) Hey, George, thanks again for getting me those Yankee tickets. 

GEORGE

Oh, yeah. Still in good with the ground crew. (Laghs) 

TIM

(Notices a woman walking by) Oh, hey, listen, I'd better circulate.. (moving over to the woman) Happy Chanukah, Tiffany! (they both move off camera) 

ELAINE

This place is like Studio 54 with a menorah. 

GEORGE

I'm gonna get some more of these kosher cocktail franks.. (leaves) 

ELAINE

Oh.. (sees a guy looking at her) I got denim vest checking me out. (laughs) Fake phone number's coming out tonight. 

JERRY

You have a standard fake? 

ELAINE

Mm-hmm. 

JERRY

(Notices an attractive woman walking by, starts to follow her) That's neat. 

ELAINE

(Holds onto Jerry's arm) No, please! Denim vest! He's smoothing it! Jerry! God! (Jerry excapes Elaine's grasp, moves over to the woman. The man wearing a denim vest moves over to Elaine.) 

VEST

Hi! 

JERRY

Hi, I'm Jerry. 

WOMAN

Hi. JERRY: You might not know it to look at me, but I can run really, really fast. 

ELAINE

Nice vest. I like the.. big metal buttons 

VEST

They're snaps. Listen, maybe we should, uh, go out some time? 

ELAINE

Why don't I give you my phone number? 

GEORGE

Hey. 

JERRY

Hey! How'd it go with the cocktail franks? 

GEORGE

Great! I ate the entire platter! Had to call in sick today. 

JERRY

Didn't you call in sick yesterday? 

GEORGE

Hey, I work for Kruger Industrial Smoothing: 'We don't care, and it shows.' 

JERRY

(Notices George brought hhis mail) You're gonna open your mail here? 

GEORGE

Hey, at least I'm bringing something to this. (Starts flipping through envelopes, reads one ) 'Have you seen me?' (Flicks it aside) Nope. (looks at next envelope) Woah, something from Whatley. 

JERRY

See? You give, and you get. 

GEORGE

(Reading the card from Whatley) 'This holiday season a donation has been made in your name to the Children's Alliance.'? 

JERRY

Oh, that's nice. 

GEORGE

I got him Yankee's tickets! He got me a piece of paper saying 'I've given your gift to someone else!' 

JERRY

To a children's charity! 

GEORGE

Don't you see how wrong that is?! Where's your Christmas spirit? And eye for an eye! 

ELAINE

Hey! 

JERRY

Hey. 

ELAINE

(To waitress) Oh, nothing for me. (Waitress leaves) I'm going to 'Atomic Sub' later. 

JERRY

'Atomic Sub'? Why are you eating there? 

ELAINE

I got a card, and they stamp it every time I buy a sub. 24 stamps, and I become a submarine (makes a gesture) captain. 

JERRY

What does that mean? 

ELAINE

(Embarrassed) Free sub. 

ELAINE

What? 

GEORGE

Nothing. It's a card from my dad. 

ELAINE

What is it? (Grabs the card from George, he tries to stop her, but fails. She reads it out loud.) 'Dear son, Happy Festivus.' What is Festivus? 

GEORGE

It's nothing, stop it.. 

JERRY

When George was growing up.. 

GEORGE

(Interrupting) Jerry, No! 

JERRY

His father.. 

GEORGE

No! 

JERRY

Hated all the commercial and religious aspects of Christmas, so he made up his own holiday. 

ELAINE

Ohhhh.. and another piece of the puzzle falls into place. 

GEORGE

(pleading) Alright.. 

JERRY

And instead of a tree, didn't your father put up an aluminum pole? 

GEORGE

Jerry! Stop it! 

JERRY

And weren't there a feats of strength that always ended up with you crying? 

GEORGE

I can't take it anymore! I'm going to work! ARe you happy now?! (Gathers his things, and runs out of the coffee shop. Elaine and Jerry laugh hysterically) 

ELAINE

Oh, I can't believe it! I've lost my 'Atomic Sub' card!.. Oh no! I bet I wrote that fake number on the back of it when I gave it to denim vest! 

JERRY

So? 

ELAINE

I've eaten 23 bad subs, I just need 1 more! It's like a long, bad movie, but you want to see the end of it! 

JERRY

No, you walk out. 

ELAINE

Alright, then, it's like a boring book, but you gotta finish it. 

JERRY

No, you wait for the movie! 

ELAINE

(Irritated, and through clinched teeth) I want that free sub. 

JERRY

You don't need the card. High-end hoagie outfit like that, it's all computerized! (Snaps) They're cloning sheep now. 

KRAMER

(Correcting) No, they're not cloning sheep. It's the same sheep! I saw Harry Blackstone do that trick with two goats and a handkerchief on the old Dean Martin show! 

JERRY

So, why don't you just try your blow-off number and see if he's called it? 

ELAINE

That's a good idea. 

KRAMER

(Answering phone) Yeah, Go! Wha.. really? Yeah, ok. Yeah! Bye. (Hangs up) Great news! Yeah, the strike has been settled. I'm going back to work. 

JERRY

What strike? 

KRAMER

Yeah, H&H Bagels. That's where I worked. 

JERRY

You? 

ELAINE

Worked? 

JERRY

Bagels? 

KRAMER

Yeah. Look, see. I still have my business card. (Pulls it out, hands it to Elaine) Yeah, we've been on strike for 12 years. 

ELAINE

Oh, I remember seeing those guys picketing out there, but I haven't seen them in a long time. 

KRAMER

Yeah, well, H&H wouldn't let us use their bath room while we were picketing. It put a cramp on our solidarity. 

ELAINE

What were your.. demands? 

KRAMER

Yeah, 5.35 an hour. And that's what they're paying now. 

ELAINE

I believe that's the new minimum wage. 

KRAMER

Now you know who to thank for that!.. Alright, I've got to go. (Heads for the door) 

JERRY

Why didn't you ever mention this? 

KRAMER

Jerry, I didn't want you to know I was out of work. It's embarrassing! (Leaves) (Scene ends) 

KRAMER

All right, everybody! I'm back! 

MANAGER

Who are you? 

KRAMER

Cosmo Kramer.. strikes over. 

MANAGER

Oh yeah! Kramer. 

KRAMER

Huh.. wha- Didn't any of the guys come back? 

MANAGER

NO, I'm sure they all got jobs.. like, ten years ago. 

KRAMER

Oh, man. Makes you wonder what it was all for.. 

MANAGER

I could use someone for the holidays.. 

KRAMER

Alright! Toss me an apron, let's bagel! (Takes off his coat, puts it in the display case, then turns to see a plate full of bagels.) What are those? 

MANAGER

Those are rasin bagels. 

KRAMER

(Picks one up, he's mesmerized) I never thought I'd live to see that.. 

ELAINE

So, anyway, I've been giving out your number as my standard fake. 

BOOKIE

So. You're Elaine Benes. We've been getting calls fro you for 5 years. 

ELAINE

So, listen, when this guy calls, if you could just give him my real number.. 

BOOKIE

(Interrupting) Hey, Charlie! Guess who's here. Elaine Benes. 

CHARLIE

Elaine Benes?! 

BOOKIE

You make a lot of man friends. You know who's a man? Charlie here, he's a man. You know who else? Me. I'm a man. 

CHARLIE

(faintly) I'm a man. 

ELAINE

Ohh.. my.. 

BOOKIE

I'll have this best guy call your real number. You just, uh, give it to me. And that way, I'll have it. (Slides a pad over to Elaine so she can write it down) 

ELAINE

My number? Ohh.. (looks at Kramer's business card) Okay.. Uh, well, there you go. (writes H&H's number down) And, uh, tell you what.. (looks at the board in the back) put a sawbuck on Captain Nemo in the third at Belmont. 

TIM

Hey, Jerry. 

JERRY

Hey, Tim. 

TIM

What's up? 

JERRY

Actually, I'm having dinner with a girl I met at your party. 

TIM

Mazel Tov. 

GWEN

Jerry.. hi. 

JERRY

Gwen? 

GWEN

Yeah. 

JERRY

(Not willing to believe how much uglier she is) Really? 

GWEN

Yeah! Come on, our table is ready. 

GEORGE

So, attractive one day - not attractive the next? 

JERRY

Have you come across this? 

GEORGE

Yes, I am familiar with this syndrome -- she's a two-face. 

JERRY

(Relating) Like the Batman villain? 

GEORGE

(Annoyed) If that helps you.. 

JERRY

So, if I ask her out again - I don't know who's showing up: The good, the bad, or the ugly. 

GEORGE

(Identifying what Jerry said) Clint Eastwood! 

JERRY

Yeah. 

GEORGE

Hey, check this out. I gotta give out Christmas presents to everyone down at Kruger, so I'm pulling a Whatley. (Give a Christmas card to Jerry) 

JERRY

(Reading it) 'A donation has been made in your name to the Human Fund.' - What is that? 

GEORGE

(With pride) Made it up. 

JERRY

(Continuing reading) 'The Human Fund. Money for people.' 

GEORGE

What do you think? 

JERRY

It has a certain understated stupidity. 

GEORGE

(Once again, Identifying) The Outlaw of Josey Whales! 

JERRY

..Yeah. 

KRAMER

Ah, gentlemen.. bagels on the house! 

JERRY

How was your first day? 

KRAMER

Oh, fantastic! (Jerry and George both pick out a bagel) It felt so good to get my hands back in taht dough. 

JERRY

Your hands were in the dough? 

KRAMER

No, I didn't make these bagels. (Jerry and George both take a bite) Yeah, they're day-olds. The homeless won't even touch them. (Jerry and George stop eating) Oh, we try to fool them by putting a few fresh ones on top, but they dig.. they, they test. 

GEORGE

Alright. Uh, well, I'm out of here. (Gets up to leave) 

JERRY

Happy Festivus! 

KRAMER

What's Festivus? 

JERRY

When George was growing up.. 

GEORGE

(Interrupting) No! 

JERRY

His father.. 

GEORGE

Stop it! It's nothing. It's a stupid holiday my father invented. It doesn't exist! 

ELAINE

Happy Festivus, Georgie. 

KRAMER

Frank invented a holiday? He's so prolific! 

ELAINE

Kramer, listen, I got a little phone relay going, so, if a guy calls H&H and he's looking for me, you take a message. 

JERRY

You're still trying to gget that free sub? 

ELAINE

Hey! I have spent a lot of time, and I have eaten a lot of crap to get to where I am today. And I am NOT throwing it all away now. 

JERRY

Is there a captain's hat involved in this? 

ELAINE

Maybe. 

FRANK

Kramer, I got your message. I haven't celebrated Festivus in years! What is your interest? 

KRAMER

Well, just tell me everything, huh? 

FRANK

Many Christmases ago, I went to buy a doll for my son. I reach for the last one they had - but so did another man. As I rained blows opon him, I realized there had to be another way! 

KRAMER

What happened to the doll? 

FRANK

It was destroyed. But out of that, a new holiday was born. 'A Festivus for the rest of us!' 

KRAMER

That musta been some kind of doll. 

FRANK

She was. 

GEORGE

Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas! (Co-worker gives a gift to George) Oh, Sandy! Here is a little something for you.. (hands her a card) 

SANDY

(After reading the cheap gift, she's suddenly unimpressed) ..Oh.. thanks. (Walks off) 

GEORGE

Phil, I loved those cigars! Incoming! (Flicks his card tward Phil) 

PHIL

Ow! 

GEORGE

Aw, Mr. Kruger, Sir. Merry Christmas! (Hands him a card) 

KRUGER

Not if you could see our books.. what's this? 

GEORGE

The Human Fund. 

KRUGER

Whatever. (Walks off) 

GEORGE

Exactly. (Sees an off-camera co-worker) Erica! 

FRANK

And at the Festivus dinner, you gather your family around, and you tell them all the ways they have disappointed you over the past year. 

KRAMER

Is there a tree? 

FRANK

No. Instead, there's a pole. It requires not decoration. I find tinsel distracting. 

KRAMER

Frank, this new holiday of yours is scratching me right where I itch. 

FRANK

Let's do it then! Festivus is back! I'll get the pole out of the crawl space. (Turns to leave, meets up with Elaine) 

ELAINE

Hello, Frank. 

FRANK

Hello, woman. (leaves) 

ELAINE

Kramer! Kramer.. any word from the vest? 

KRAMER

No. (To manager of H&H) Ah, listen, Harry, I need the 23rd off. 

MANAGER

Hey! I hired you to work during the holidays. This is the holidays. 

KRAMER

But it's Festivus. 

MANAGER

What? 

KRAMER

You know you're infringing on my right to celebrate new holidays.. 

MANAGER

That's not a right. 

KRAMER

Well, it's going to be! Because I'm going back on strike. Come on Elaine. (Takes of his apron, and goes for his coat) It's a walk out! 

ELAINE

No, I got to stay here and wait for the call. 

KRAMER

What? You're siding with management?! 

ELAINE

No, I just.. 

KRAMER

(Interrupting) Scab! Scab! (pointing at Elaine) Scab! 

GWEN

Hey. 

JERRY

Boy, am I glad to see you. 

GWEN

You were expecting someone else? 

JERRY

You never know. 

GWEN

(To driver) You know, you might want to take the tunnel. 

JERRY

So, uh, what do you feel like eating? Chinese or Italian? 

GWEN

I can go either way. 

JERRY

(Shocked) You're telling me. 

GEORGE

So, she was switching? Back and forth? 

JERRY

Actually, the only place she always looked good was in that back booth over there. 

GEORGE

So, just bring her here. This is all you really need. 

JERRY

I can't just keep bringing her to the coffee shop. I mean, what if things, you know, progress? 

GEORGE

Lights out. 

JERRY

Alright, I'll give it a shot! I do really like this coffee shop. Nice cuff links, by the way. 

GEORGE

(Pointing to them) Office Christmas gift. I tell you, this Human Fund is a gold mine! 

JERRY

That's not a french cuff shirt, you know. 

GEORGE

I know. I cut the button off and poked a hole with a letter opener. 

JERRY

Oh, that's classy. 

KRAMER

Well, Happy Festivus. 

GEORGE

What is that? Is taht the pole?! 

FRANK

George, Festivus is your heritage - it's part of who you are. 

GEORGE

(Sulking) That's why I hate it. 

KRAMER

There's a big dinner Tuesday night at Frank's house - everyone's invited. 

FRANK

George, you're forgetting how much Festivus has meant to us all. I brought one of the casette tapes. (Franks pushes play, George as a child celebrating Festivus is heard) 

FRANK

Read that poem. 

GEORGE

(Complaining) I can't read it. I need my glasses! 

FRANK

You don't need glasses, you're just weak! You're weak! 

ESTELLE

Leave him alone! 

FRANK

Alright, George. It's time for the feats of strength. 

GEORGE

No! No! Turn it off! No feats of strength! (Gets up and starts running out of the coffee shop) I hate Festivus! 

FRANK

We had some good times. 

GWEN

Hey. 

JERRY

I there. This is Kramer, and Frank. 

GWEN

Hi. 

KRAMER

(Shocked at her ugliness, he stammers) Hello. 

GWEN

So, you ready to go? 

JERRY

Uh, why don't we stay here? The back booth just opened up. (They both walk to the booth and sit down. Suddenly, Gwen is attractive) Now this is a good looking booth. 

KRAMER

Protect Festivus! Hey, no bagels, no bagels, no bagels, (Continues to chant) 

MANAGER

(To a waiting Elaine) Lady, if you want a sandwich, I'll make you a sandwich. 

ELAINE

(Whining) I want the one that I earned. (Phone rings) I'll get it. I'll get it! (Into phone) H&H, and Elaine. 

KRAMER

(From a phone booth right outside the store) Elaine, you should get out of there. I sabotaged the bagel machine last night. It's going down. 

ELAINE

What did you do? 

KRAMER

You've been warned. 

ELAINE

Oh, hi! (Waves at him) 

WORKER

Hey, the steam valve's broke. 

MANAGER

Can we still make bagels? 

WORKER

Sure. It's just a little steamy. 

KRAMER

Hey! How do you like your bagels now?! 

KRUGER

George, I got something for you. (Pulls a check from his pocket) I'm suppose to find a charity and throw some of the company's money at it. They all seem the same to me, so, what's the difference? (Hands the check to George) 

GEORGE

20 thousand dollars? 

KRUGER

Made out to the Human Fund. (Tries to enter his office, but it's locked) Oh, damn. I've locked myself out of my office again. Oh well. I'm going home. 

GWEN

Jerry, how many times do we have to come to this.. place? 

JERRY

Why? It's our place. 

GWEN

I just found a rubber band in my soup. 

JERRY

Oh.. I know who's cooking today! 

GEORGE

Hey! Surprise, surprise! 

JERRY

Hey, Georgie! 

GWEN

I think I'm just gonna go. 

JERRY

I'll be here. 

GEORGE

(Sees Gwen's meal) Hey, soup. 

JERRY

She didn't touch it. 

GEORGE

Ohh.. Paco! (Flicks rubber band tward the kitchen) Hey, take a look at this. (Hands Jerry Kruger's check) 

JERRY

20 thousand dollars from Kruger? You're not keeping this. 

GEORGE

I don't know. 

JERRY

Excuse me? 

GEORGE

I've been doing a lot of thinking. This might be my chance to start giving something back. 

JERRY

You want to give something back? Start with the 20 thousand dollars. 

GEORGE

I'm serious. 

JERRY

You're going to start your own charity? 

GEORGE

I think I could be a philanthropist. a kick ass philanthropist! I would have all this money, and people would love me. Then they would come to me.. and beg! And if I felt like it, I would help them out. And then they would owe me big time! (Thinking to himself) .. First thing I'm gonna need is a driver.. 

ELAINE

Kramer, the vest just called. 

KRAMER

(Shocked by the way Elaine looks) Yama - Hama! It's fright night! 

ELAINE

Oh, yeah, I got a little steam bath. Listen, in 10 minutes, I'm gonna have my hands on that 'Atomic Sub' card. 

KRAMER

And? 

ELAINE

(Embarrassed) Free sub. (Starts to leave) I'll see ya. 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

GWEN

Kramer, Hi! 

KRAMER

Oh, hello. 

GWEN

It's Gwen.. We met .. at the coffee shop. 

KRAMER

Ah-huh. 

GWEN

I'm dating your friend, Jerry.. 

KRAMER

Ahh.. I don't know who you really are, but I've seen Jerry's girlfriend, and she's not you. You're much better looking - and like, a foot taller. 

GWEN

That's why we're always hiding in that coffee shop! He's afraid of getting caught. 

KRAMER

Oh, he's a tomcat. 

ELAINE

Steve. 

VEST

Hmm? 

ELAINE

It's Elaine. 

VEST

From Tim Whatley's party? 

ELAINE

Yeah. 

VEST

You look.. different. 

ELAINE

I see you're still sticking with the denim. (He's wearing a denim coat) Do you have that card that I gave you? 

VEST

Well, I had it back at my place, but I can't go there now.. I'll give it to you later, or something. 

ELAINE

No, no, no. You give me your number. 

VEST

Okay. Sure. (Pulls out a pad, and starts writing a number down) Do you have the mumps? 

ELAINE

No. 

VEST

Typhoid? 

ELAINE

No. 

VEST

(Hands her the paper, and runs off) Yama - Hama! 

ELAINE

A fake number! Blimey! 

KRUGER

George, we have a problem. There's a memo, here, from accounting telling me there's no such thing as the Human Fund. 

GEORGE

Well, there could be. 

KRUGER

But there isn't. 

GEORGE

Well, I - I could, Uh, I could give the money back. Here. (Holds it out) 

KRUGER

George, I don't get it. If there's no Human Fund, those donation cards were fake. You better have a damn good reason why you gave me a fake Christmas gift. 

GEORGE

Well, sir, I - I gave out the fake card, because, um, I don't really celebrate Christmas. I, um, I celebrate Festivus. 

KRUGER

Vemonous? 

GEORGE

Festivus, Sir. And, uh, I was afraid that I would be persecuted for my beliefs. They drove my family out of Bayside, Sir! 

KRUGER

Are you making all this up, too? 

GEORGE

Oh, no, Sir. Festivus is all too real. And.. I could prove it - if I had to. 

KRUGER

Yeah, you probably should. 

GEORGE

Happy Festivus! 

FRANK

George? This is a surprise. (Looking at Kruger) Who's the suit? 

GEORGE

Yo, dad. This is my boss, Mr. Kruger. 

FRANK

Have you seen the pole, Kruger? 

GEORGE

Dad, he doesn't need to see the pole. 

FRANK

He's gonna see it. 

GEORGE

Happy Festivus! (Sees Elaine) Yama - Hama! 

ELAINE

I didn't have time to go home. What are you doing here? 

GEORGE

Embracing my roots. 

JERRY

They nailed you on the 20 G's? 

GEORGE

Busted cold. 

FRANK

It's made from aluminum. Very high strength-to-weight ratio. 

KRUGER

I find your belief system fascinating. 

KRAMER

Hey! Happy Festivus, everyone! (Hugs George, and jumps up and down) Hee, hee, hee! 

BOOKIE

Hello again, Miss Benes. 

ELAINE

What are you doing here? 

BOOKIE

Damnedest thing.. me and Charlie were calling to ask you out, and, uh, we got this bagel place.. 

KRAMER

(Finishing the story) I told them I was just about to see you.. It's a Festivus miracle! 

ESTELLE

Dinner's ready! 

FRANK

Let's begin. 

KRUGER

Dr.. Van Nostrand? 

KRAMER

Uh.. that's right. 

FRANK

Welcome, new comers. The tradition of Festivus begins with the airing of grievances. I got a lot of problems with you people! And now you're gonna hear about it! You, Kruger. My son tells me your company stinks! 

GEORGE

Oh, God. 

FRANK

(To George) Quiet, you'll get yours in a minute. Kruger, you couldn't smooth a silk sheet if you had a hot date with a babe.. I lost my train of thought. 

GWEN

Jerry! 

JERRY

Gwen! How'd you know I was here? 

GWEN

Kramer told me. 

KRAMER

Another Festivus miracle! 

GWEN

I guess this is the ugly girl I've been hearing about. 

ELAINE

Hey, I was in a shvitz for 6 hours. Give me a break. 

JERRY

Gwen. Gwen, wait! Ah! (runs back to his seat) Bad lighting on the porch. 

ELAINE

(To bookie) Hey, how'd my horse do? 

BOOKIE

He had to be shot. 

FRANK

And now as Festivus rolls on, we come to the feats of strength. 

GEORGE

Not the feats of strength.. 

FRANK

This year, the honor goes to Mr. Kramer. 

KRAMER

Uh-oh. Oh, gee, Frank, I'm sorry. I gotta go. I have to work a double shift at H&H. 

JERRY

I thought you were on strike? 

KRAMER

Well, I caved. I mean, I really had to use their bathroom. Frank, no offence, but this holiday is a little (makes a series of noises) out there. 

GEORGE

Kramer! You can't go! Who's gonna do the feats of strength? 

KRUGER

(Sipping liquor from a flask) How about George? 

FRANK

Good thinking, Kruger. Until you pin me, George, Festivus is not over! 

GEORGE

Oh, please, somebody, stop this! 

FRANK

(Taking off his sweater) Let's rumble! 

ESTELLE

I think you can take him, Georgie! 

GEORGE

Oh, come on! Be sensible. 

FRANK

Stop crying, and fight your father! 

GEORGE

Ow! .. Ow! I give, I give! Uncle! 

FRANK

This is the best Festivus ever! 

MANAGER

Alright. That's enough. You're fired. 

KRAMER

Thank - you! (Gets his coat, and leaves) 

GEORGE

When are they gonna have the flying cars, already?  

JERRY

Yeah, they have been promising that for a while..  

GEORGE

Years. When we were kids, they made it seem like it was right around the corner.  

JERRY

I think Ed Begley Jr. has one.  

GEORGE

No. That's just electric.  

JERRY

What about Harrison Ford? He had one in, uh, Blade Runner. That was a cool one.  

GEORGE

(Sarcastically) What's the competition, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang?  

JERRY

Well, what do you think the big holdup is?  

GEORGE

The government is very touchy about us being in the air. Let us run around on the ground as much as we want. Anything in the air is a big production.  

JERRY

Yeah, right. And what about the floating cities?  

GEORGE

And the underwater bubble cities?  

JERRY

It's like we're living in the '50s here.  

KRAMER

It's good suspension!  

JERRY

(To Kramer) Would you stop it? You'll have plenty of time to destroy it after I get it. Hey, George, I'm buyin' this car. (Gestures to a black Saab)  

GEORGE

Shhh... What is wrong with you? You never tell 'em you like the car. (Advising) You're not sure what you want. You don't even know why you're here.  

JERRY

(Gestures to his forehead) You're getting that vein again.  

GEORGE

I'm starving. We should have had lunch first..  

JERRY

(Trying to quiet George down) It'll be twenty minutes. I told ya, Puddy's getting me an insider deal.  

GEORGE

Since when is Elaine's boyfriend selling cars? I thought he was a mechanic.  

JERRY

I guess he graduated.  

GEORGE

There's an easy move: go from screwin' you behind your back to screwin' you right to your face.  

JERRY

(To Kramer) Thank you.  

GEORGE

Puddy's just gonna give you the car, huh? (Skeptically) You'll see. First they stick you with the undercoating, rust-proofing, dealer prep. Suddenly, you're on your back like a turtle.  

JERRY

All right. Calm down.  

GEORGE

My father had a car salesman buddy. He was gonna fix him up real nice. Next thing I know, I'm gettin' dropped of in a Le Car with a fabric sunroof. All the kids are shoutin' at me, 'Hey, Le George! Bonjour, Le George! Let's stuff Le George in Le Locker!'  

KRAMER

Jerry, I don't think this thing is hooked up right.  

JERRY

(To Kramer) All right, we're goin' in.  

SALESMAN

You've got a good eye, there. I see you've noticed the uni-body construction. I'm Rick. Are you looking to buy or to lease?  

KRAMER

Uh, borrow. It's for my friend. Yeah, he'll be buying..  

RICK

Maybe I should talk to him.  

KRAMER

Oh, I don't think so. No, he's an entertainer. You know, all over the place. That's where I come in.  

RICK

I see. So, you're his manag-  

KRAMER

Yeah, neighbor. That's right. Yeah, why don't we take this boiler out for a shakedown huh?  

GEORGE

Look at these salesmen. The only thing these guys fear is the walk-out. No matter what they say, you say, 'I'll walk out of here right now!'  

SALESMAN

Can I help you with something?  

GEORGE

(Threatening) Hold it! One more step and we're walkin'!  

JERRY

(Scolding) George. (To salesman) Sorry, we're just waiting for David Puddy.  

GEORGE

(Still with a tone) He is. You don't know what I'm doin' here.  

ELAINE

Hey.  

JERRY

Hey.  

PUDDY

Sorry I'm late.  

ELAINE

(Full of pride) My new salesman boyfriend took me out to celebrate his promotion.  

JERRY

Ah. Where'd you go?  

ELAINE

(Obviously embarrassed) Uh, to a restaurant.  

PUDDY

Arby's.  

ELAINE

I had the roast beef... 

JERRY

So, Puddy, I decided I'm gonna go with another 900 convertible.  

PUDDY

All right. Classic. (Holds his hand up) High-five.  

ELAINE

(Interrupting) David, can you tell me where the Xerox machine is?  

PUDDY

Oh, sure, babe. Salesman-only copy room (Points) right there.  

ELAINE

Oh. (Leaves for the room)  

PUDDY

(To Jerry and George) Hey, come on, guys. I'll show you the 900.  

GEORGE

(Mocking, skeptic) Yeah, you show us the 900.  

RICK

... And look at these features, Mr. Kramer: Anti-lock brakes, automatic climate control. Uh, (Points out the windshield) make a right at this corner, please. (Goes back to the features) An adjustable steering wheel, and... Oh, Mr. Kramer, you missed the turn..  

KRAMER

No, no, no, I didn't.  

RICK

Well, that's okay. (Pointing) We'll make this next right, and swing around to get back to the dealership.  

KRAMER

(Up to something) Well, it's a test drive, right? I never drive around here. If I'm gonna recommend this car, I need to see that it'll handle my daily routine.  

RICK

Well where are we going?  

KRAMER

Just a little place I like to call, 'You'll see'.  

GEORGE

I'm starving. You got any of those free donuts you use to soften people up?  

PUDDY

(Pointing out his office door) By the service department.  

GEORGE

(Getting up, he addresses Jerry) All right, remember: no rust-proofing. Commit to nothing. If you have to speak - mumble.  

JERRY

(As George is leaving for the donuts) Au revoir, Le George.  

GEORGE

Don't think it can't happen! (Leaves)  

JERRY

So, Puddy, this is a pretty good move for you, huh? No more 'grease monkey'.  

PUDDY

I don't care for that term.  

JERRY

Oh. Sorry, I didn't know..  

PUDDY

No, I don't know too many monkeys who could take apart a fuel injector.  

JERRY

I saw one once that could do sign language.  

PUDDY

Yeah, I saw that one. Uh.. Koko.  

JERRY

Yeah, Koko.  

PUDDY

Right, Koko. That chimp's all right. (Holds up his hand) High-five.  

GEORGE

Hey, hey, hey! What's goin' on here? (To Jerry) You didn't agree to anything, did ya?  

JERRY

No. We both just saw the same monkey.  

GEORGE

(Aggravated) Well, I got screwed on the donuts. There were none left. Heh!  

PUDDY

(Standing up) Well, there's a vending machine. I could show you where it is. (Leaves, showing George the way)  

GEORGE

(To Jerry) Hey, gimme a dollar.  

JERRY

(Getting a dollar out) Where's your money?  

GEORGE

(Talking it) I'm here helpin' you.  

ELAINE

Hey. Where's Puddy? The copy machine is broken.  

GEORGE

(On his way out) Heh, heh, heh. That's what they want you to think.  

JERRY

Hey, Elaine, have you noticed your boyfriend has developed an annoying little habit?  

ELAINE

(Squints, imitating Puddy) The squinting?  

JERRY

No.  

ELAINE

(Stares ahead, again, imitating Puddy) The staring?  

JERRY

No. He keeps asking me to give him a high-five.  

ELAINE

(Shrugging) I thought all guys do that.  

JERRY

Slapping hands is the lowest form of male primate ritual. In fact, even some of them have moved on - they're doing sign language now.  

ELAINE

It's that bad?  

JERRY

What do you think the Nazis were doin'? (Imitates the Nazi's salute) That was the heil-five.  

ELAINE

(Pointing out) Isn't that from your act, like, ten years ago?  

JERRY

(Slightly embarrassed) It was a good bit in the '80's, and it's still relatable today.  

PUDDY

Good news. We got a 900 in black. That's the hot color. (Holds up his hand) High-five.  

ELAINE

Um, David, you know what? Can you come help me fix the copy machine? Come. 

PUDDY

(Pointing at Jerry) You owe me five.  

GEORGE

Twix.. (Makes various noises) B-5.  

GEORGE

Ah, come on!  

GEORGE

Ah, excuse me. Do you have, uh, change of a dollar?  

MECHANIC

(While retrieving his candy) No.  

GEORGE

Could I, uh, could I trade you for another dollar?  

MECHANIC

(While walking away) Don't have one.  

GEORGE

(Stopping him) Ah, excuse me. When your, uh, when your wallet was open, I - I glanced inside, and I couldn't help but notice that you have several crisp dollar bills.  

MECHANIC

(Calm) You're incorrect.  

GEORGE

(Persistent) Perhaps you could look again, please? I'm very hungry.  

MECHANIC

(While taking his exit) We had donuts earlier.  

GEORGE

(Losing it) I guess everyone here enjoys giving the old screwgie, huh?! You're all doin' a hell of a job! (Looks longingly at the Twix in the machine) Ho, ho. What I would do with you..  

RICK

Uh, Mr. Kramer, we're really not allowed to use the cars to run errands.  

KRAMER

Now look, Rick. I'm very close to giving this car, that my celebrity friend is considering, my full endorsement. (Looks out the window) Oooh, Let's see if I can get a smile from these femininas.. (Yells out to them) Hey, Ladies! (Points to the car) It's the Saab 900! What do you think? Can I interest you in a little supplemental restraint?! (They obviously do something to offend him. Kramer reacts with a face) Geez...  

JERRY

(Tapping the door you lift to retrieve your candy on the machine) I think the candy comes out over there.  

GEORGE

People can drop change down here, Jerry. And they're too lazy to pick it up.  

JERRY

Either that, or they've got a weird little hang-up about lying face-down in filth. Why don't you just go to the cashier?  

GEORGE

The cashier is at lunch - which is where I'd like to be.  

JERRY

How much was under there?  

GEORGE

(Looking at his finger) I think somethin' bit me. I just need another nickel.  

JERRY

(While fishing through his pocket for change) Hey, Puddy thinks I should go for the CD player. What do you think? (Hands him a nickel)  

GEORGE

Ho, ho, ho! He's got a live one. He's just reeling his big fish in!  

JERRY

Hey, can I have my dollar back?  

GEORGE

(Stingy) It's wrinkled. It's worthless.  

GEORGE

(As the Twix starts to move) Ha, ha, ha, ha! (The Twix gets stuck in the spindle right before falling. George begins to pound the machine) Come on! Jump!  

MAN

They just put out some more donuts.  

GEORGE

They did?  

MAN

(Holding his up) Last one.  

KRAMER

Well, just one more errand and we can head back.  

RICK

Actually, it looks like we're gonna need some gas.  

KRAMER

Oh? Well, how much gas do you think is in there right now?  

RICK

(Looking) Well, it's on 'E'.  

KRAMER

You know, Rick, oftentimes, Jerry - he lends me his car and I find myself in a situation where the car is almost out of gas. But, for a variety of reasons, I don't want to be the one responsible for purchasing costly gasoline.  

RICK

(Pointing out) So, you want to know how far you can drive your friend's car for free.  

KRAMER

(In the spotlight, his voice goes high) Well, I make it up to him in other ways.  

GEORGE

As you will see, the candy bar is paid for, and yet, remains dangling in the machine. (Notices that the Twix slot is completely empty) Hey, it's gone. Where is my Twix? (Quickly looks around. His sights fall on the window of a door labeled 'Employees Only'. The same mechanic from before is eating a candy bar) What?! That guy's eatin' it!  

SALESMAN

Well, how do you know that one's yours?  

GEORGE

Uh, it was dangling! There were only two left in the machine! He must've bought one, and gotten both.  

SALESMAN

Sir, are you gonna buy a car?  

GEORGE

No! (The salesman walks away. He addresses the mechanic through the door's window) Hey! Hey! I see you! That is my Twix! (The mechanic eats the last of the Twix, obviously to make George even more angered. It works) Oh, ha, ha! Ho, ho!  

PUDDY

Paper jam.. Got it!  

ELAINE

Yay! 

PUDDY

(Holds his hand up) High-five. (Elaine reluctantly slaps it. He turns around, and puts his hand out behind his back) On the flip side.  

ELAINE

David, um, I..  

PUDDY

(Still holding out his hand) Don't leave me hangin'.  

ELAINE

You're a salesman now - and the high-five is... it's very 'grease monkey.'  

PUDDY

What did I tell you about that?  

ELAINE

Ah, I, I'm sorry, but the high-five is just so stupid.  

PUDDY

(Somewhat hurt) Oh yeah? I'll tell you what's stupid. You. Stupid.  

ELAINE

(Sarcastically) Oh, that is really mature.  

PUDDY

Yeah? So are you. You're the grease monkey.  

ELAINE

(Confused at David's attempts at a comeback) Uh... that doesn't make any sense. I am leaving.  

PUDDY

Yeah, if you leave, we're through.  

ELAINE

Fine! We're through!  

PUDDY

Oh, so you're leaving?  

ELAINE

(While leaving) That's right. (Mocking Puddy, she puts her hand up) High-five! (Turns around, putting her hand behind her back like he had done) On the flip side! (As Elaine is leaving, she mutters to herself) Takin' me to Arby's...  

JERRY

(Sees Elaine leaving) Hey! Wh-where are you...?  

PUDDY

Let's finish this up.  

JERRY

Did you two break up?  

PUDDY

(While punching up numbers on a calculator) That chick's whacked. We're history. (Back to the transaction) I just left out a couple of things: uh, rust-proofing...  

JERRY

'Rust-proofing'?  

PUDDY

(Reading off what he's adding up on the calculator) Transport charge, storage surcharge, additional overcharge, finder's fee...  

JERRY

'Finder's fee'? It was on the lot!  

PUDDY

Yeah, that's right. (Continues reading off) Uh, floor mats, keys...  

JERRY

'Keys'?!  

PUDDY

How ya gonna start it?  

GEORGE

Excuse me. I believe you just ate my Twix bar. It was dangling. And when you purchased your Twix bar, you got a little freebie, and you never bothered to ask why, or seek out its rightful owner.  

MECHANIC

First of all, it wasn't a Twix. It was a 5th Avenue bar.  

GEORGE

Huh. You must think I'm pretty stupid. (The mechanic shoots him a look as if he cleary does think he's stupid) That was no 5th Avenue bar. I can see the crumb right there in the corner of your lip! Now, that-that-that is a cookie - and we all know that Twix is the only candy bar with the cookie crunch.  

MECHANIC

It's uh, it's just a little nougat.  

GEORGE

Nougat? Please. I think I've reached the point in my life where I can tell the difference between nougat and cookie. So let's not just say things that we both know are obvious fabrications.  

MECHANIC

(Pointing to George's forehead) You know, you're gettin' a little vein there..  

GEORGE

(Watching the mechanic leave) I know about the vein! I can't believe this guy..  

JERRY

Hey, George!  

GEORGE

Hey, starving! (Grabs the box from Jerry)  

JERRY

No, last one. Listen, you gotta help me out. Elaine and Puddy just broke up, he's treatin' me just like a regular customer, now!  

GEORGE

I tried to tell you, but you wouldn't listen. No, ho, ho! You were gonna get a deal, huh? There's no laws in this place. Anything goes! It's Thunderdome!  

SALESWOMAN

Is someone helping you?  

GEORGE

Stay back! (Runs out of the room, pushing Jerry out ahead of him) 

RICK

(Trying to look at the gas gauge) Where is it now?  

KRAMER

There's still some overlap between the needle and the slash below the 'E'.  

RICK

How low are you gonna go?  

KRAMER

Oh, I've been in the slash many times. This is nothing. You'll get used to it. Just, (Makes a popping sound) put it out of your mind.  

RICK

Have you ever been completely below the slash?  

KRAMER

Well, I almost did once, and I blacked out. When I came to, the car was in a ditch, and the tank was full. I don't know who did it, and I never got to thank them..  

RICK

(As the car slowly drifts off the road) Mr. Kramer, the road!  

KRAMER

Whoop! Whoop!  

JERRY

(Threatening tone) So, listen, Puddy. When we first started this deal, I thought things were gonna be different. Now, if you want to play hard ball, I got my friend, George, here, and he can play pretty hard... ball. (Leaving the negotiation to George) George, vein it up.  

GEORGE

All right, Puddy, listen, and listen good: I need to know the name of that mechanic that walks around here. Big guy, a liar. Short name. Sam? Moe? Sol?!  

JERRY

George! Can we focus on the car, here?  

GEORGE

I'm starving! I can feel my stomach sucking up against my spine.  

PUDDY

(Handing a sheet of paper to Jerry) Jerry, I just need your signature here, and we'll get you that yellow car ready to go.  

JERRY

Yellow? I wanted black.  

PUDDY

I can't give you black at that price.  

JERRY

(Pleading) George, would you help me, please?  

GEORGE

(Standing up) Yes. This is wrong!  

JERRY

Sing it, sister!  

GEORGE

Just because a candy bar fails to fall from its perch... 

JERRY

(Exasperated) Oh, God...  

GEORGE

(Losing it) ...does not imply transfer of ownership. Moe, Sol, or... Lem is not gonna get away with this!  

JERRY

(To Puddy) I'll be right back.  

PUDDY

Okay.  

JERRY

Hey, George!  

RICK

Is it just the angle I'm looking from?  

KRAMER

No, Sir. We are down there.  

RICK

Oh, this is amazing! Oh, I've never felt so alive!  

KRAMER

All right, I'm satisfied. We better get some gas.  

RICK

What? Well, we can't stop now.  

KRAMER

What do you mean?  

RICK

We have to keep going - all the way back to the dealership. That was the plan.  

KRAMER

There was no plan.  

RICK

Well, let's make it the plan! Let's just... go for it! Like Thelma and Louise.  

KRAMER

What, they drove to a dealership?  

RICK

No, they drove off a cliff.  

KRAMER

You are one sick mama... I like it.  

RICK

Mr. Kramer, the road!  

KRAMER

Yup! Yup!  

ELAINE

Hello?  

JERRY

(Over the phone) Elaine, you've got to get back down to the dealer. Puddy is screwin' me on this car, which is yellow now!  

ELAINE

(Jokingly mimicking Jerry) Who is this?  

JERRY

(Banging the phone against the booth) Elaine!  

ELAINE

What?!  

JERRY

You gotta get back together with Puddy so I can make this deal.  

ELAINE

(Sarcastically) You know, just that you cared enough to call means so much, Jerry.  

JERRY

You're gonna get back together, anyway. It's thousands of dollars!  

ELAINE

Oh, I don't know..  

JERRY

Come on. Then you don't have to see him again 'til my 15,000-mile check.  

ELAINE

Well, will you pay my cab fare out there?  

JERRY

Fine.  

ELAINE

And I didn't like that roast beef, so how 'bout some lunch?  

JERRY

No. No lunch.  

ELAINE

I'll hang this phone up right now!  

JERRY

All right! Lunch!  

ELAINE

I'll see ya. (Hanging up the phone)  

JERRY

Bye. (Hangs up)  

JERRY

(Frustrated, he reacts) Everybody's ripping me off!  

GEORGE

Yes, I'd like to report a problem with one of your mechanics.  

WILLIE

When did you bring the car in?  

GEORGE

(To the man behind him in line) Yeah, right... I'm gonna get my car repaired at a dealership. Huh! Why don't I just flush my money down the toilet?  

WILLIE

Sir, what, exactly, is the problem?  

GEORGE

One of your guys - Kip, or Ned, short name - stole my Twix candy bar!  

WILLIE

Are you saying he grabbed your candy bar away from you?  

GEORGE

He might as well have! I caught him, and his face was covered in chocolate and cookie crumbs.  

WILLIE

I thought you said it was a Twix.  

GEORGE

Oh, it was. But he claimed it was a 5th Avenue bar.  

WILLIE

Maybe it was.  

GEORGE

Oh, no, no. Twix is the only candy with the cookie crunch.  

WILLIE

What about the Hundred-Thousand-Dollar bar?  

GEORGE

No. Rice and caramel.  

WILLIE

Nougat?  

GEORGE

No.  

WILLIE

Positive?  

GEORGE

Please.  

WOMAN

You know they changed the name from Hundred-Thousand-Dollar bar to Hundred-Grand?  

GEORGE

All I want is my seventy-five cents back, an apology, and for him to be fired!  

SR

I remember when you used to be able to get a Hershey for a nickel.  

MAN

What's the one with the swirling chocolate in the commercial?  

GEORGE

They all have swirling chocolate in the commercial!  

SR

Not Skittles.  

WILLIE

Dad, I told you you could sit here only if you don't talk.  

WOMAN

(Sitting behind George) You make your father sit here all day?  

WILLIE

He likes it!  

GEORGE

All right, do you mind? I have the window! (To Willie) Now, what are you gonna do about my Twix?  

MAN

(In line behind George) Twix has too much coconut.  

GEORGE

No! There's no coconut!  

WOMAN

(Behind service window) I'm allergic to coconut.  

WILLIE

I'm not.  

SR

...A nickel!  

ELAINE

Cab receipt. Hey, Puddy.  

PUDDY

I'm with a customer.  

ELAINE

Uh...  

JERRY

No, no. No, Elaine, the car can wait. What's important is you two getting back together. Eh, then we'll talk about the car.  

PUDDY

(Like a kid) I don't want to get back with her. She's too bossy.  

ELAINE

(Raising her finger at him, in an authoritative tone) David..  

JERRY

Okay. Now, I know this is an important decision. Why don't we all just sit down and talk about it? Come on, come on. (All three sit down) Now, look, you both find each other attractive, right?  

PUDDY

Right.  

JERRY

Clearly, no one else can stand to be with either one of you.  

ELAINE

I guess.  

PUDDY

Good point.  

JERRY

(Smiling, like a salesman) All right. Now, what do I have to do to put you two in a relationship today?  

KRAMER

Cars can go on empty, but not us humans, huh, fella? I'll get us a couple of Twix bars.  

RICK

No, no coconut for me.  

KRAMER

All right, I'll get ya a Mounds bar. Keep the engine running.  

RICK

Ahh!  

KRAMER

No, man! Not the gas!  

RICK

But it needs it, Kramer! It needs it bad!  

KRAMER

Do you think that this'll make you happy? 'Cause it won't!  

RICK

(Walking away) Ah, you can just go on without me.  

KRAMER

Listen to me. When that car rolls into that dealership, and that tank is bone dry, I want you to be there with me when everyone says, 'Kramer and that other guy, oh, they went further to the left of the slash than anyone ever dreamed!'  

RICK

Maybe we better get moving.  

KRAMER

It's good to have you back, Stan.  

RICK

It's Rick, by the way.  

KRAMER

No time!  

WILLIE

Mr. Costanza, I really don't have time for this.  

GEORGE

Now, if this mechanic guy, was, in fact, eating a 5th Avenue bar, as he claims, wouldn't you agree he would have no problem picking one out from a candy line-up?  

WILLIE

'Candy line-up'?  

GEORGE

I've spent the last hour preparing ten candy bars with no wrappers or identification of any kind for him to select from.  

WILLIE

It took you an hour?  

GEORGE

Only I hold the answer key to their true candy identities. And so, without further ado, I give you... the candy line-up. (Opens a door to a back room. Various dealership employees are munching on candy bars)  

SALESWOMAN

Hey, Willie, check it out! Free candy!  

GEORGE

That's my candy line-up! Where are all my cards?! They're - they're all on the floor!  

GEORGE

And you! How many Twix does that make for you, today?! Like, 8 Twix?!  

MECHANIC

No.  

MAN

Hey, this Clark bar is good.  

GEORGE

It's a Twix! They're all Twix! It was a setup! A setup, I tell ya! And you've robbed it! You've all screwed me again! Now, gimme one! Gimme a Twix!  

MECHANIC

They're all gone.  

GEORGE

(Yelling out, frustrated. The camera spins from a top angle) Twwwwiiiiiixxxxx!  

ELAINE

What was that?  

PUDDY

There's a mental hospital right near here.  

JERRY

All right. Elaine, David, I believe we have a deal here in principle: Arby's no more than once a month. And in exchange, Elaine comes to your softball game, and doesn't read a book.  

ELAINE

(While looking over the contract Jerry just drew up) Yeah, well, that's not bad.  

PUDDY

I can live with that.  

JERRY

So, you're back together?  

PUDDY

Yeah.  

JERRY

All right, all right. All right, that's enough! Let's get back to my deal. That undercoating, that's a rip-off, isn't it, David?  

PUDDY

Oh, we don't even know what it is.  

JERRY

So, I'm gettin' the insider's deal?  

PUDDY

Insider's deal. (Holds up his hand) High-five.  

RICK

(Seeing the turn-off up ahead) There's the dealer!  

KRAMER

Hey!  

RICK

We did! We pulled it off! I can't believe it! Where's the needle?  

KRAMER

Oh, it broke off, baby! Woo, hoo, hoo!  

RICK

Oh, Mr. Kramer, I gotta thank you. I - I learned a lot. Things are gonna be different for me now.  

KRAMER

Well, that's a weird thing to say...  

RICK

I wonder how much longer we could have lasted.  

KRAMER

Yeah, yeah. I wonder... hmm.  

ELAINE

This is nice. What kind of car is this?  

CABBIE

Caprice Classic.  

ELAINE

(To Jerry) You couldn't just give him one high-five?  

JERRY

And where does it end? Then everyone's doin' it. It's like the wave at ball games. Air quotes. The phrase, 'Don't go there.' - Someone's gotta take a stand!  

GEORGE

(Munching on a hamburger) This Arby's is good.  

ELAINE

So, George, I still don't understand - how was that a setup?  

JERRY

And who were you tryin' to set up, anyway? The mechanic or the manager?  

GEORGE

I don't know. All of 'em. They're all crooks! Besides, I couldn't get all different candy bars, anyway.  

GEORGE

What was that?  

JERRY

I think there's a mental hospital near here.  

ELAINE

Very near.  

KRAMER

Ya-hoo! Ya-hoo! (Rick is silent) Whew! Well, I think we stopped.  

RICK

You - you can probably let go of my hand now.  

KRAMER

Yeah, yeah. (Getting out of the car) Well, I'll think about it..  

RICK

Do you have my card?  

WAITRESS

Careful, this plate is extremely hot. 

ELAINE

Thank you. Ow! 

WAITRESS

I just told you it was hot. Why'd you touch it? 

ELAINE

I just wanted to know what your idea of 'hot' is. 

PUDDY

Hey, babe. You ready to hit the ice? 

ELAINE

I am ready to skate up a-- ha, ha, ha...Why are you wearing that? 

PUDDY

It's my winter coat. 

ELAINE

A fur? 

PUDDY

Is there a problem? 

ELAINE

A seemingly infinite supply. 

ELAINE

Ow! Careful, it's hot. 

PUDDY

Ow! 

JERRY

So, Puddy wear's a man fur? 

ELAINE

He was struttin' around the coffee shop like Stein Erickson. 

JERRY

And, of course, you find fur morally reprehensible. 

ELAINE

Eh, anti-fur. I mean, who has the energy anymore? This is more about hanging off the arm of an idiot. 

GEORGE

And this is the first you're seeing of the coat? 

ELAINE

We never dated in winter. 

JERRY

You might want to get a look at that bathing suit drawer. 

ELAINE

Oh, I walked by Bloomingdale's the other day, and I saw that massage chair we want to get Joe Mayo as an apartment gift. 

GEORGE

An apartment-warming gift? We got to give presents to people for moving? Birthdays, Christmas, it's enough gifts. I would like one month off. 

JERRY

Kramer said it's a perfect gift. That's what we're gettin' him. 

GEORGE

All right, but we're not buyin' it at Bloomingdale's. I will buy it, you pay me back later. I'll sniff out a deal. I have a sixth sense. 

JERRY

Cheapness is not a sense. 

ELAINE

I can't stand Joe Mayo's parties. You know, the second you walk in, he's got you workin' for him. 'Hey, can you do me a favor? Can you keep an eye on the ice, make sure we have enough?' Uh... 

JERRY

I had a great time at the last one. I was in charge of the music. I turned that mother out. 

KRAMER

Hey. 

JERRY

Hey. 

KRAMER

You got any pliers? 

JERRY

What, has Newman got another army man stuck in his ear? 

NEWMAN

Hilarious. 

KRAMER

Newman and I are reversing the peepholes on our door. So you can see in. 

ELAINE

Why? 

NEWMAN

To prevent an ambush. 

KRAMER

Yeah, so now I can peek to see if anyone is waiting to jack me with a sock full of pennies. 

JERRY

But then anyone can just look in and see you. 

KRAMER

Our policy is, we're comfortable with our bodies. You know, if someone wants to help themselves to an eyefull, well, we say, 'Enjoy the show.' 

ELAINE

I'm sorry I can't stay for the... second act. 

JERRY

Hey, George. Here's the model number on that chair, by the way. 

KRAMER

Mmm... Nice wallet. 

NEWMAN

Wallet. 

JERRY

What? 

KRAMER

Nobody carries wallets anymore. I mean, they went out with powdered wigs. Yeah, see here's what you need. Just a couple of cards and your bankroll. See, keep the big bills on the outside. 

JERRY

That's a five. 

KRAMER

I'm on the Mexican, whoa ohh, radio... 

SILVIO

Eh, what are you doing? 

KRAMER

Hey, Silvio. Yeah, I'm reversing my peephole. 

SILVIO

Hey, you know you gotta get permission from me. I'm the super. Who said you could do that? 

KRAMER

Well, who says I can do any of the things I do in my place? 

SILVIO

Like what? 

KRAMER

Well, I... uh, nothing. No, I'll, um, I'll switch it back. 

SILVIO

No, no, no, no. No, that's all right. 

KRAMER

Well, that's good. Because, uh, Newman and I-- 

SILVIO

Newman? He did this, too? 

KRAMER

Well, yeah. 

SILVIO

I deal with him. 

GEORGE

Hey, look at this. This is the same massage chair we're gettin' for Joe Mayo, $60 cheaper. 

JERRY

Except the store's in Delaware. 

GEORGE

I'll have 'em overnight it. 

JERRY

Maybe cheapness is a sense. You know it is better without this big wallet. It's more comfortable. 

GEORGE

It doesn't matter if it's more comfortable. It's wrong. 

JERRY

Why? 

GEORGE

Because important things go in a case. You got a skull for your brain, a plastic sleeve for your comb, and a wallet for your money. 

JERRY

But look at this thing. It's-it's huge. You got more cow here than here. 

GEORGE

I need everything in there. 

JERRY

Irish money? 

GEORGE

I might go there. 

JERRY

Show this card at any participating Orlando-area Exxon station...to get your free 'Save the Tiger' poster. 

GEORGE

All right, just gimme that. And gimme some of those Sweet & Lows. 

KRAMER

Who is it? 

NEWMAN

It's Newman. 

KRAMER

What do you want? I'm in the middle of something. 

NEWMAN

I can't believe I'm being evicted. 

KRAMER

What? What are you talking about? 

NEWMAN

The reverse peepholes. Silvio said I'm an agitator and I'm out of the building. 

KRAMER

No. No, he can't do that. 

NEWMAN

I'm homeless! I'm gonna be out on a street corner, dancing for nickels. I'll be with the hobos in the trainyard, eating out of a bucket. 

KRAMER

Come on, we'll go and talk to him, and we'll straighten this thing out. 

NEWMAN

Uh, you, uh, you better put something on. 

JERRY

George, I am loving this no wallet thing. 

GEORGE

A man carries a wallet. 

JERRY

You know, the very fact that you oppose this makes me think I'm onto something. 

MAYO

Hey, Jerry. 

JERRY

Hey, Joe Mayo. Nice place. 

MAYO

Thanks. George, can you do me a favor and stay by the phone in case anybody calls and needs directions? 

GEORGE

Love to. 

MAYO

Thanks. Jerry... 

JERRY

Music? 

MAYO

Actually, can you keep an eye on the aquarium and make sure nobody taps on the glass? 

JERRY

But I could do that and the music. 

MAYO

Oh, no, don't worry about the music. Just... have fun! 

JERRY

I was ready to get jiggy with it. 

PUDDY

Hey. 

JERRY

Hey, Elaine. 

ELAINE

Hey. I think you know Dr... Zaius. 

JERRY

So, Elaine, notice anything different about my... pants? 

ELAINE

So, George... did you get the chair? 

GEORGE

No, I don't have it yet. 

JERRY

So, we're givin' him nothing? 

GEORGE

No, I brought a picture of the chair. 

JERRY

Did you at least get him a card? 

GEORGE

I thought we'd all sign the picture. 

MAYO

Elaine... 

ELAINE

Hey, Joe Mayo. 

MAYO

I need you to be in charge of coats. 

ELAINE

Oh, fantastic. 

MAYO

And Puddy, can you make sure no one puts a drink on my...sound system? 

PUDDY

Sure thing, Joe Mayo. 

JERRY

Hi, I'm Jerry. How do you like my pants? 

KERI

Nice. 

JERRY

(talking to George) It's working. (to the girl, who's tapping on the aquarium) Don't tap on the glass. 

GEORGE

(answering the phone while walking away) Joe Mayo's apartment? 

PUDDY

(standing guard by the stereo as George walks by him) Hey! Cocktail off the speaker. 

ELAINE

Goodbye, Dr. Zaius. 

SILVIO

Why are we in Jerry's apartment? 

KRAMER

Well, I, uh, I like to think of this as my conference room. Yeah, it has a more formal atmosphere, you know, with the shelves, and the furniture. 

SILVIO

Make it quick Kramer, my wife and I are about to go bowling. 

KRAMER

Oh, well, um, Newman thinks that you, uh, evicted him? 

SILVIO

I did. I don't like Mr. Newman. He is an agitator. 

KRAMER

Look... I've known Newman all my life, in the building, and you're all wrong about him. He's a model tenant. Portly, yes, but smart as a whip. 

SILVIO

OK, on your word he can stay. 

KRAMER

All right. 

SILVIO

But... I'm gonna keep my eye on him. 

KRAMER

Well, you won't regret it. 

SILVIO

What's wrong? 

MAYO

Elaine, thanks for coming. 

ELAINE

Good working with you. 

PUDDY

All right, let's hit the bricks. 

ELAINE

What? 

MAYO

Hey, I got a coat just like this! 

ELAINE

Oh. Uhhh... 

ELAINE

So Joe Mayo had the same coat. 

GEORGE

And you threw it out the window? 

ELAINE

Mm-hmm. 

GEORGE

God, you're like a rock star. 

ELAINE

So now Joe Mayo wants me to buy him a new coat. 

JERRY

Because you threw it out. 

ELAINE

No, because I was in charge of the coats. It's... insane. 

JERRY

But you did actually throw his coat out the window. 

ELAINE

But he doesn't know that. As far as he knows, somebody stole it, and that's the person who should be responsible. 

JERRY

But that's you. 

ELAINE

So I guess I'll have to buy him a new coat, even though I don't think I should be held responsible, which I am anyway. 

GEORGE

Well, I'm satisfied. Uh...my back is...killing me. 

JERRY

Of course. Because of that wallet. You-you got a filing cabinet under half of your ass. 

GEORGE

This...is an organizer, a secretary, and a friend. 

ELAINE

Look at you. You're on a slant. 

GEORGE

Here, just give me a couple of napkins. 

GEORGE

There, there I'm fine. 

JERRY

What was that? 

GEORGE

I think I had some hard candy in there. 

GEORGE

No, no, this is supposed to go to Joe Mayo's apartment. 

GEORGE

Ahhh. How does this thing work? 

MAN

Sir, do you want me to deliver this to your friend's place or not? 

GEORGE

Ahhhhh... 

KERI

Ready to go? 

JERRY

All set. I can't believe I'm going dancing. 

KERI

You don't go that often? 

JERRY

No, because it's so stupid. Shall we? 

KERI

Do me a favor. Can you hold this stuff for me? 

JERRY

Compact, lipstick, all this? 

KERI

And can you help to carry my keys? 

JERRY

What are you, a medieval dungeon master? 

KERI

And a tin of altoids. 

JERRY

Ow! Sharp key. 

KRAMER

So, you're sleeping with Silvio's wife? 

NEWMAN

Well, there's very little sleeping going on. 

KRAMER

Well, why didn't you tell me about this? 

NEWMAN

Quite frankly, I don't see how it's any of your business. 

KRAMER

Well, it's my business now. Look, I stuck up for you. Man, if he catches you, we're both out. 

NEWMAN

Hey, what is that up that tree? 

KRAMER

Hoooh! Man, that looks like a dead bear. 

NEWMAN

No, that's a fur coat! Hey, uh, give me a boost. 

KRAMER

Man, where did you learn to climb trees like that? 

NEWMAN

The Pacific Northwest. 

ELAINE

So, you had to carry some of Keri's stuff. Big deal. 

JERRY

You don't understand. I went on a successful pocket diet, and I want to keep that weight off. 

ELAINE

You know what? We sell this thing at Peterman that would be perfect for you. 

JERRY

Not more of that crap from the Titanic? 

ELAINE

No. No. It's a small men's carryall. 

JERRY

I'm not carrying a purse. 

ELAINE

It's not a purse. It's European. 

JERRY

Oh. 

ELAINE

Hey, did George buy Joe Mayo that chair yet? 

JERRY

I don't know. 

ELAINE

If I'm gettin' him a new fur, I'm not chippin' in on a gift, too. 

GEORGE

Yeah? 

JERRY

Hey, George, did you get Joe Mayo that chair yet? 

GEORGE

Not yet. Oh! Ho ho! God... 

JERRY

What? 

GEORGE

It's in... transit. 

ELAINE

Did he get it? 

JERRY

No. 

ELAINE

Mmm, good. Tell him I'm out. 

GEORGE

(hearing Elaine over the phone) What, she's out? 

JERRY

Well, so what? You're gettin' a deal, right? We'll split it three ways. 

GEORGE

Allllll right! 

JERRY

What is that noise? 

GEORGE

(hangs up the phone) That's my toaster. I got to go. Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh! 

JERRY

You know, sometimes I get the feeling George isn't being completely honest with me. 

KRAMER

Hey. Oh, uh, yeah. Uh, here are your pliers back....Weak hinge. 

ELAINE

Well, I guess I better go and price fur coats. 

KRAMER

Oh, go down to 88th Street. They're free. 

ELAINE

What are you talking about? 

KRAMER

Well, they're hanging from the trees. You know, Newman found one there yesterday. Man, that guy can climb like a ring-tailed lemur! 

ELAINE

88th Street? That's where Joe Mayo lives. That's the coat! 

JERRY

What was that pop sound? 

KRAMER

Well, I had some hard candy in there. 

NEWMAN

So, to what do I owe this unusual invitation? 

ELAINE

Come in, come in. 

NEWMAN

Ahh! This is very much as I imagined it to be. Aside from this rattan piece, which seems oddly out of place. 

ELAINE

Please, sit down. Newman, um, I wanted to talk to you about something. 

NEWMAN

This isn't about my opening your mail? 

ELAINE

What? 

NEWMAN

Because I don't, never have, anything I read was already open. 

ELAINE

Uh, yeah, uh, no. Newman, uh, I heard that you found a fur coat in a tree. And, I believe that it belongs to a friend of mine, and I'd like to give it back to him. 

NEWMAN

Sorry. Climbers, keepers. 

ELAINE

You know, Newmie. Um, I know how you feel about me, and I have to tell you, I'm quite flattered. 

NEWMAN

You are? 

ELAINE

Oh, yeah. I mean, of all the men that I know, you're the only one who's held down a steady job for several years. 

NEWMAN

Well, it's-it's interesting work, I don't mind it. 

ELAINE

Ha ha ha ha. 

NEWMAN

Don't you have a-a boyfriend? A, uh, burly, athletic type? 

ELAINE

Uh, don't worry, he's cool. 

NEWMAN

Cool? 

ELAINE

Very cool. So, what do you say? Can you do this one little favor, Newmie? 

NEWMAN

Oh, how I've waited for this moment. But alas, my heart belongs to another man's wife, and I have given the coat to her. 

ELAINE

All right, we're done here. 

NEWMAN

For I am in love with Svetlana, and I don't care if the whole world knows, except for Silvio, who would throw me out of the apartment, where I would be dancing on the sidewalk-- 

ELAINE

Thank you, thank you, thank you very much. 

KERI

Nice carryall. 

JERRY

It's European. 

KERI

Do you still have my lipstick? 

JERRY

Uh, yeah, I think I do. I can never find anything in here. Ah, here it is. So, that Joe Mayo throws the worst parties, doesn't he? So what was your job? 

KERI

My job was to keep you away from the music. 

JERRY

What, he doesn't like my taste in music? 

KERI

Guess not. 

JERRY

You should've been there last year. I got jiggy with it! 

SILVIO

Kramer! It's Silvio! Open up, I need to talk to you! I can see you through the reverse peephole. 

KRAMER

Hey, Silvio! 

SILVIO

Look at this. 

KRAMER

Huh? 

SILVIO

Svetlana says she find it in the laundry room, but I think it is a gift from that postman agitator. Where is he? 

KRAMER

Relax, Silvio. 

SILVIO

No, that's it. You're both out of the building! 

KRAMER

Oh, come on! Hey, Newman didn't even give her that! No, that's not even a woman's coat. It's a man's! 

SILVIO

A man's? 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

SILVIO

What kind of a man would wear fur? 

KRAMER

Oh, lots of 'em. 

SILVIO

Would you? 

KRAMER

No. 

SILVIO

Then who? 

KRAMER

What about Jerry? 

SILVIO

Jerry? 

KRAMER

Yeah, sure, he's a celebrity. Oh, yeah, they wear a lot of furs. They're desperate, insecure people. 

SILVIO

Yes, you are right. It's all about, me, me, me. Please, look at me! I am so pretty! Love me! Want me! 

KRAMER

Yeah, something like that. 

JERRY

I have to do what? 

KRAMER

All you have to do is wear the fur so Silvio thinks it's yours. 

JERRY

I'm not wearing the fur. 

KRAMER

Well, then, Newman and I, we get thrown out of the building. 

JERRY

Is that right? 

KRAMER

All right, why don't you just take a good, hard look at what your life will be like if I'm not around? 

JERRY

Newman, too? 

KRAMER

Oh, come on, man! Well, I'll tell you what, if you do this, I'll give you that walkman you're always asking about. 

JERRY

That's my walkman! 

KRAMER

And you'll get it back. 

JERRY

All right. 

KRAMER

All right. Good, thanks, I owe you one. 

GEORGE

Hey. 

KRAMER

Oh, hey, and by the way, uh, that walkman was broke when you gave it to me. 

JERRY

George, did you get that chair yet? 

GEORGE

It gets here when it gets here. Would you stop ridin' me? 

JERRY

You know what? Just call up and cancel it. I'm out. 

GEORGE

Excuse me? 

JERRY

Joe Mayo doesn't like my taste in music. He's not gettin' a gift from me. 

GEORGE

Oh, I can't believe you're dropping out, too. So now Kramer and I have to pay for the entire gift? 

KRAMER

Whoa, whoa. Now, who's this Joe Mayo everyone's talking about? 

GEORGE

He's the guy we're the buying the chair for, remember? It was your suggestion. 

KRAMER

I think the chair is a fantastic gift idea. But I never heard of this Joe Mayo. And frankly, it sounds made up. 

GEORGE

Oh, so now I have to buy this whole chair by myself? 

JERRY

No, you don't have to buy anything. 

GEORGE

I already bought it! I've been lyin' to you for three days, and now you're all screwin' me! 

JERRY

I don't understand. Why didn't you tell us you had it? 

GEORGE

I needed it! My back is... a little tweaked. 

JERRY

Because of your giant wallet. Just get rid of it! 

GEORGE

Never! It is a part of me. I will just return the chair, and it will be easy, because the receipt is in my good friend. 

JERRY

Your good friend is morbidly obese. 

GEORGE

Well, at least, I'm not carrying a purse. 

JERRY

It's not a purse. It's European! 

KRAMER

All right, Silvio's down there. He's shoveling the walk. Now, all you gotta do is put this on, you go down to the corner, you pick up a paper, and you come right back. 

JERRY

All right. 

KRAMER

There you go. 

JERRY

How do I look? 

KRAMER

Ahh.... 

GEORGE

Learn guitar, first lesson free? Huh. 

GEORGE

My receipts! The chair! My tiger poster! 

JERRY

Hey, Silvio, just out for a little stroll in my favorite fur coat. 

SILVIO

That is your coat? 

JERRY

It sure is. 

SILVIO

Kramer says you need it because you're an entertainer and you're desperate for attention. 

JERRY

That's true. 

KRAMER

Jerry, you forgot your purse. 

JERRY

Oh, thanks. 

KRAMER

Hey, Silvio, look at Jerry here, prancing around in his coat with his purse. Yup, he's a dandy. He's a real fancy boy. 

JERRY

Maybe this isn't my coat. 

KRAMER

All right, you're not fancy! 

SILVIO

No, he's very fancy! Want me, love me! Shower me with kisses! 

ELAINE

Jerry, where'd you get it? That's his coat. 

JERRY

No, it's not. It's mine. I'm a fancy boy. 

ELAINE

No, that's not your coat. 

SILVIO

If that is not his coat, whose coat is it? 

ELAINE

It's Joe Mayo's coat. 

SILVIO

Who's Joe Mayo? 

KRAMER

That must be the man that's sleeping with your wife. 

JERRY

Hey! Officer! Someone took my European carryall! 

JERRY

The...black, leather...thing with a strap. 

JERRY

Yes, a purse. I carry a purse! 

JERRY

So, Silvio ambushed Joe Mayo? 

ELAINE

Yeah, he was waitin' inside his apartment for him with a sock full of pennies. 

JERRY

He should have had a reverse peephole. 

PUDDY

Hey, Babe. 

JERRY

Hello? Hello? 

ELAINE

What is that? 

PUDDY

It's my new coat. 

ELAINE

You ditched the fur? 

PUDDY

Yeah, I saw Jerry wearing his. He looked like a bit of a dandy. Check it out! 8-Ball! You got a question, you ask the 8-Ball. 

ELAINE

You're gonna wear this all the time? 

PUDDY

All signs point to 'Yes!' 

JERRY

So your saying UNICEF is a scam? 

KRAMER

It's the perfect cover for a money laundering operation . No one can keep track of all those kids with the little orange boxes of change. 

JERRY

Oh! No it's Sally Weaver. 

KRAMER

Oh! Yeah your old college roommate huh? 

JERRY

No, It's Susan Ross's old college roommate; she moved to New York a few years ago . she's trying to become an actress. 

KRAMER

Hmmm,, Dramatica comedia heh! 

JERRY

Untalented, She's always inviting me to see her in some bad play in tiny room without ventilation. It's really depressing. 

KRAMER

Euh.. We don't go to enough theater. 

JERRY

She should just give up. 

JERRY

Heeyyy!... 

SALLY

Hey there Mr. Too big to come to my shows. I just came back from (?) Whoooooooo.....I'm on my way to an audition still waiting for that big break. 

KRAMER

Why don't you just give up? 

JERRY

Kramer!!! 

KRAMER

At least that's what Jerry says. Now face it. If it hasn't happen it's not gonna happen. All right, we go grab some bouffe . Join us? 

JERRY

So......Susan's dead..... 

KRAMER

I think she was happy someone finally said it. 

JERRY

Why'd you have to say anything to her? 

KRAMER

'felt that the conversation was lagging. 

JERRY

Why can't you ever keep your big mouth shut? 

KRAMER

I come in here to get a pleasant meal and if we're not gonna have one I'll grab a bite to eat at your place. 

ELAINE

You know, maybe Kramer is right, some people should just give up . I have. 

JERRY

What did you wanna be? 

ELAINE

I don't remember, but it certainly wasn't this. Look at this cartoon in the New Yorker, I don't get this. 

JERRY

I don't either. 

ELAINE

And you're on the fringe of the humor business. 

GEORGE

Hey! 

ELAINE

Hey! George look at this. 

GEORGE

That's cute. 

ELAINE

You got it? 

GEORGE

No, never mind. 

ELAINE

Come on, We're two intelligent people here. We can figure this out. Now we got a dog and a cat in an office. 

JERRY

It looks like my accountant's office but there's no pets working there. 

ELAINE

The cat is saying ' I've enjoyed reading your E-mail'. 

GEORGE

Maybe it's got something to do with that 42 in the corner . 

ELAINE

It's a page number. 

GEORGE

Well, I can't crack this one. 

ELAINE

Aahh! this has got to be a mistake. 

GEORGE

try shaking it...(long pause) Well,Janet should be here any minute. 

JERRY

You've been hiding her from us. you must really like her? 

GEORGE

Aah! the minute I saw this girl, we just clicked. She's got such a nice face. hummmm her eyes, her mouth, nose 

ELAINE

We know what a face consists of. 

JANET

I'm sorry I'm late. 

GEORGE

Jerry, Elaine, I give you.. Janet. 

JANET

Nice to meet you. 

ELAINE

Hi! 

JANET

Do we still have time to make the movie? 

GEORGE

Oh! euh.. Yeah We just can't go to the supermarket to get some candy. 

ELAINE

Jerry, She looks exactly like you. 

JERRY

She does not. 

ELAINE

Well maybe she doesn't, I don't care. 

JERRY

Hey! Kramer. 

KRAMER

hey! you got some messages.. Yeahumm.. .George, George, Elaine, George again, Elaine, Newman; but that was a crank call. and some Sally woman called said 'Thanks a lot, she's quitting the business, you ruined her life. 

JERRY

What! You're the one who ruined her life. 

KRAMER

Well that's not how she remembers it. 

JERRY

Well, I got to talk her out of this. 

KRAMER

I thought you said she stinks 

JERRY

She does stink and she should quit. But I don't want it to be because of me. It should be the traditional route; years of rejections and failures till she's spit out the bottom of the porn industry. 

JERRY

Yeah... 

GEORGE

Hey! George and Janet. 

KRAMER

Aahh...Who's Janet? 

JERRY

George's girlfriend, Elaine thinks she looks like me but I think it's as you would say,kookie talk. 

KRAMER

You know what woman I always thought you looked like; Leena Horne. 

ALL

Hey, Hey! 

KRAMER

And you must....look exactly like Jerry. You don't see this; you're like twins .. WOoooohhhhh!!! this is eerie. 

GEORGE

Kramer, what are you talking about...Janet doesn't look anything like Jerry 

JANET

well maybe we do look a little like each other. 

GEORGE

No..hummm, What do you know about what you look like. 

KRAMER

C'mon George relax . Just because they look alike doesn't mean you're secretly in love with Jerry. 

GEORGE

(nervous) All right now we're going bye bye. 

JANET

We just got here George 

GEORGE

Well,,, it's getting dark. 

KRAMER

yeah, she's a nice girl, kinda quiet though. 

JERRY

What are you doing? Don't tell a woman she looks like a man and George doesn't want to hear his girlfriend looks like me and frankly neither do I 

KRAMER

Well how should I have 'broached the subject' 

JERRY

You don't broach, you keep your mouth shut. 

KRAMER

Well sounds like someone's having a bad day. 

JERRY

Yeah! Because of you. 

KRAMER

Well, I think one of us should leave. 

JERRY

Sally, you can't quit the business. This is all because of me. 

SALLY

(nods) Hehumm!! 

JERRY

You can't give up. You don't think people tell me I stink? When I'm on stage that's all I hear; You stink, You suck. We like magic. 

SALLY

Really? 

JERRY

Of course, I stink, you stink. It's show bizz. everybody stinks.. 

SALLY

Yeah! You've been stinking since the Eighties. 

JERRY

All right, I think we've covered my act. Now you get out there and stink it up with everybody else. 

SALLY

Right!, Yesss!! Thank you I'm gonna do it. (starts to eat her food) 

JERRY

NOW!!!!.... (she leaves in a hurry) 

ELAINE

Well I've asked every one at work and nobody gets this cartoon. I mean I don't understand why no one can explain it, but I'm gonna get to the bottom of this. 

JERRY

Oh! I think we're at the bottom. 

ELAINE

(to George who just came in) Hey! George, Janet looks very nice and she's quite a handsome woman. 

GEORGE

What does that mean? 

JERRY

Yeah. What does that mean? 

GEORGE

(to Jerry) What do you mean by that? 

ELAINE

Enjoy. (she leaves) 

JERRY

Elaine huh?.. She's completely.. 

GEORGE

Oh! I know....'Cos you don't think Janet?.. 

JERRY

No.... 

GEORGE

Why would I... 

JERRY

It's ludicrous.. 

GEORGE

Yes. 

JERRY

For either one of us.. 

GEORGE

No... 

JERRY

So... 

GEORGE

Exactly. 

JERRY

I'm not gay. 

GEORGE

...neither am I. 

BOTH

Kramer, Kramer, get in here. 

GEORGE

Where's the crazy man, Come on up. 

JERRY

Come on in here. 

GEORGE

Haaaaaa!!! 

JERRY

What's happening? What, you doing, come and talk to us. 

KRAMER

I've made an important life decision. 

JERRY

Lets talk about that. 

GEORGE

Don't leave (George slams the door) 

KRAMER

Aw right. I know I've been shooting off at the mouth lately; First with that girl whose life you destroyed and.. emm...about George dating a lady Jerry 

GEORGE

What's the decision? 

KRAMER

I know you want me to keep my big mouth shut and that's exactly what I'm going to do. I'm never gonna talk again. 

JERRY

Yeah right. 

KRAMER

What do I need to talk for.. ha!, For to blab to the neighbors about George has a new fem-Jerry friend or to tell everybody at the coffee shop ho George is all mixed up in a perverse sexual amalgam of some girl and his best friend. See now, I've done all that.....Now it's time for silence. 

GEORGE

Silence YES!! 

JERRY

Kramer you're never gonna be able to completely stop talking. 

KRAMER

Jerry, ninety four percent of communications is non-verbal. Here watch. 

JERRY

Well what does this mean? 

KRAMER

Well it's Frank and Estelle's reaction of hearing George's man love towards she-Jerry. 

GEORGE

(frantic by now) SHUT UP,SHUT UP, SHUT UP,...(then leaves) 

KRAMER

That's the idea. 

JERRY

Kramer there's no way you stick to this. 

KRAMER

(makes a zipper gesture to his mouth) ..Weeeeeepp!! 

JERRY

Oh! you just startin' now? 

KRAMER

that's right......Aye oooh!! ...Right now. 

KRAMER

Ouch!!..........Now!! 

ELINOFF

So, J. Peterman wants to hire some of our cartoonists to illustrate your catalog? 

ELAINE

Well we're hoping that if perhaps that the catalog is a little funnier,people won't be so quick to return the clothes ha ha....For example.. I..I really do....Well I love this one 

ELINOFF

Oh! yeah... That's a rather clever jab at inter office politics don't you think. 

ELAINE

Ahan, Ahan....yeah...Euh but, Why is it that the, that the animals enjoy reading the email? 

ELINOFF

Well Miss Benes . Cartoons are like gossamer and one doesn't dissect gossamer. heh..hemm.. 

ELAINE

Well you don't have to dissect if you can just tell me. Why this is suppose to be funny? 

ELINOFF

Ha! It's merely a commentary on contemporary mores. (slides the magazine to her) 

ELAINE

But, what is the comment. (she slides the magazine back to him) 

ELINOFF

It's a slice of life. 

ELAINE

No it isn't. 

ELINOFF

Pun? 

ELAINE

I don,t think so. 

ELINOFF

Vorshtein? 

ELAINE

That's not a word.....You have no idea what this means do you? 

ELINOFF

No. 

ELAINE

Then why did you print it. 

ELINOFF

I liked the kitty. 

ELAINE

(gets up) You know what? you people should be ashamed of yourself, you know ya doodle a couple of bears at a cocktail party talking about the stock market. You think you're doing comedy. 

ELINOFF

Actually that's not bad.. 

ELAINE

Oh! really (laughs) well you know..... I have others 

JERRY

Sally, I can't believe you're already doing a One-woman show? 

SALLY

No, no.. It's just a little performance piece I wrote... You know what? You really inspired me,oKay, a tear. 

JERRY

Ah! There you are.(Kramer motions silence) 

JERRY

Aw.. right, code of silence.. how's that going?....Ha!!... 

SALLY

Hi everybody think you're really going to like this 'cos it' about me...All right it's not just about me It's about me and this guy; Jerry Seinfeld. who I like to call; The Devil...Okay, Okay so.. I run into this Jerry on the street and he says to me ' Sally, You stink, You should give up acting.' Oh! I'm doing Jerry Now so you've got imagine I have ; horns, a tail and hooks instead of feet. (big laughs from the audience and Kramer is cracking up) 

JERRY

(to Kramer) Oh! Shut up!!! 

ELAINE

She does a full hour about how you're the devil .I got to go see this thing. 

JERRY

Good luck, It's sold out for the next three weeks. 

ELAINE

Well I bet I can get in once I mention I'm from ...The New Yorker. 

JERRY

The New Yorker? 

ELAINE

Yes, The New Yorker, I've met with their cartoon editor and I got him to admit that that cartoon ...MADE NO SENSE.... 

JERRY

Wow! Good work, Nancy Drew 

ELAINE

Then we ended up going out to lunch and he had some great gossip about James Thurber. 

JERRY

Nodding off... 

ELAINE

....And he said I could submit some of my own cartoons. 

JERRY

Wow! that's incredible......But you don't draw. 

ELAINE

I do to. 

JERRY

What, your sad little horsies, the house with the little curl of smoke, the sunflower with the smiley face. the transparent cube... (as she leaves) 

ELAINE

It's better than your drawings of naked Lois Lane. 

JERRY

Where did you see that? Those are private!!! 

SALLY

Jerry, sorry I'm late. Channel Nine is doing a piece on my show. Isn't that great? Do you hate me? 

JERRY

No,no I tought the show was terrific. I was just wondering if you have to keep saying Jerry Seinfeld is the devil. 

SALLY

Well...That is the title. 

JERRY

I know but I thought that maybe you could mention how I apologized then encouraged you to stick with it. 

SALLY

You know I workshopped that and.. SNOOZERS!!! he he he....but I'll tell you what I'll think... It's all a journey. 

JERRY

You got a little shmootz there (picks something on her sweater) 

NEWMAN

Excuse me Miss Weaver, OH! My god it is you! I.. I've seen your show six times.. 

JERRY

What a surprise. 

NEWMAN

Aahh! You're great,It's great, It's so great to see a show that's (looks at Jerry) about something. 

DRIVER

Where to? 

GEORGE

(we hear him think) My friends are idiots, she doesn't look like Jerry. She doesn't look like anybody. And so what if does look like Jerry,what does that mean?. That I could have everything I have with Jerry but because it's a woman I could also have sex with her....And that somehow that would be exactly what I always wanted.....She doesn't even look like Jerry.. 

SALLY

You know I really do look like your friend Jerry. 

GEORGE

I know.... 

ANNOUNCER

Thanks for watching Nine News. We leave you tonight with a scene from Sally Weavers One woman show. 

SALLY

Ok so I go to meet Jerry Seinfeld at this horrible coffee shop right? And he's like 'Hey stop doing your show.' and I'm like, Hello! It's a free country. So then he goes.' Okay Shmootsie' and he starts pulling at my sweater right?. He's getting, you know, Hands Across America. 

JERRY

There really was shmootz on I didn't try to grab her 

SALLY

...And this is what he looks like when he's eating... 

JERRY

Get Out of my House!!. 

ELAINE

Well boys, I did it. I had to stay up all night but I finally came up with a great New Yorker cartoon. 

JERRY

I'd stayed up all night I'd fixed myself up a little before I'd go out. 

ELAINE

That is not the point. 

JERRY

some mouthwash, a hat, something. 

ELAINE

Just read it! 

JERRY

(glances at it) Pretty good. 

ELAINE

Pretty good? Well uh! This is a gem . Kramer look it....(Kramer stays silent).....What? It's funny. 

JERRY

It's a pig at a complain department. 

ELAINE

And he's saying ' I wish I was taller' ha ha. See? that's his complaint. 

JERRY

I get it. 

ELAINE

Do you!!!.. because that's not a normal complaint. 

JERRY

How 'bout if it was something like ' I can't find my receipt my place's a stye. 

ELAINE

Everything with you has to be so .. jokey. 

JERRY

I'm a comedian. 

ELAINE

I wish I was taller, that's, that's, that's nice. that's real. 

JERRY

Well I got a complaint. This cartoon stinks. 

ELAINE

I'll tell you who doesn't think it stinks, The New Yorker. that's right. They're publishing it in their next issue. Oh! you know what I just ran into Newman in the hall and he said you tried to grope Sally Weaver. 

JERRY

oh! that's it I'm gonna put an end to this. 

ELAINE

The pig says 'my wife is a slut.' 

JERRY

Now that's a complaint. ...Hello Sally, yeah this is Jerry,I just wanted to leave you a message that I caught your little piece on TV and.. 

JERRY

....I'm getting a little tired of hearing how horrible I am and would appreciate it if you would leave me out of your act all together. 

JERRY

(from the back of the club, leaving) That's it I'm calling in the big guns. 

SALLY

To cease and desist on behalf of my client, Jerry Seinfeld. Signed ; Crybaby Jerry Seinfeld's Lawyer. Ok but I got two words for you Jerry Seinfeld...(censored beep)...You 

JERRY

How could she say that on TV?.. And how did she get a cable special . I 've never gotten a cable special.....well that's it I'm not giving her any more material. We are incommunicado. (to the silent Kramer on the couch beside him) ...Exactly. 

ELAINE

Check it out, from the new issue of the New Yorker...huh!...Funny isn't it? (Dugan shrugs) Look at it, the pig wants to be taller and what's this guy gonna say?.. he he...Nothin'..he he. 

PETERMAN

Elaine, I'm afraid I have incurred yet another flat tire. 

ELAINE

Can I fix that after lunch sir? 

PETERMAN

Oh! no right away, chop, chop........Oh! a new cartoon.....'I wish I was taller (hearty laugh) I'd like to see that complaint get rectified. (more laughs and he leaves) 

ELAINE

(to Dugan ) You see? You see? Smart people think this is funny and you want to know why? 'Cause I wrote it. 

DUGAN

You shouldn't make fun of pigs. (he leaves) 

PETERMAN

(returns) Flash of lightning Elaine I just realized why I like this cartoon so much. 

ELAINE

Oh! Do tell sir? 

PETERMAN

It's a Ziggy! 

ELAINE

A Ziggy? 

PETERMAN

That irreverence, that wit I'd recognize it anywhere. Some charlatan has stolen a Ziggy and passed it off as his own. I can prove it. Quick Elaine, to my archives. 

GEORGE

You know, you know what's great about our relationship?...It's not about looks. 

JANET

It's not? 

GEORGE

No, Can't be...For instance I remember when we first met, we had a great conversation. 

JANET

I remember you said I was the prettiest girl at the party. 

GEORGE

....But after that we really talked didn't we? 

JANET

Well,you told me how familiar I looked and that you must have seen me somewhere before. 

GEORGE

Na....no ... This relationship he..he..has got to be about something and fast or I'm in very serious and weird trouble....hum What else happened? 

JANET

You asked for a piece of gum because you thought your breath smelled like hummus. 

GEORGE

Aw right YES! GUM! Good enough I'll take it. 

JANET

I like gum. 

GEORGE

I do too. you see that's what we're about . You don't remind me of anyone and we love gum. 

JANET

I have gum in my hair. 

GEORGE

I'm losin' it 

SALLY

(joining Kramer) Hey! Your Jerry's friend. You're Goofy, mind if I sit. My show is going really well. Have you seen it yet? you should. Everybody else have and you know what? I got recognized the other day, How weird is that. I know . At first I liked the attention but it's like Whoa!! take three steps back, Get a life, okay. but then there wouldn't be a Sally Weaver without the fans, know what I mean. But who am I? anyway. I mean there's Sally weaver the woman, Sally Weaver the artist, Sally Weaver the person... 

KRAMER

(loudly) Now you gotta shut up!.....(Sally is speechless)...I'm sorry, I..I haven't spoken in days. 

SALLY

Well, lay it on me string bean. 

JANET

Let me get this gum out of my hair and then I'll be ready for bed. 

GEORGE

OK Look, the gum isn't cutting it for me. We need to be about something else...anything..please. 

JANET

George. 

GEORGE

Your hair? 

JANET

Well I had to cut the gum out and I had a little trouble getting it even. So why don't you get undressed George. (George speeds out the door) 

GEORGE

George is in big trouble.... 

JERRY

You ripped off a Ziggy? 

ELAINE

It must've seeped up my subconscious, Puddy has Ziggy bed sheets....D'you read the comics today? 

JERRY

I see that Ziggy's back at the complaint department.. 'The New Yorker is stealing my ideas.' ha ha ha See that's funny.....'cause it's real. 

ELAINE

Hey look it ;Sally's cable show's on (Kramer turns around to leave) 

JERRY

Hey! Kramer come on in. You've got to watch this, now she's got nothing. 

SALLY

(on TV) Master of Evil Jerry Seinfeld has broke off all contacts with me. 

JERRY

That's right sister. Why don't you just give up? 

ELAINE

Why are you yelling at the TV? 

SALLY

..OK get this; I heard he makes his best friend date women that look just like him.Hello issues.. 

JERRY

Elaine, have you been talking to her? 

ELAINE

Hey! I'm just a fan..ha ha... 

SALLY

Oh and speaking of issues . Guess who got a no-polish manicure and begged his neighbor not to tell anyone? 

JERRY

(to Kramer) I thought you stopped talking?? 

KRAMER

...All right ..Starting now...... 

JERRY

You broke up with her just because she cut her hair! how short? 

GEORGE

like that (looking at Jerry) 

JERRY

You mean like.. (points to his hair) 

GEORGE

..That. 

JERRY

So she.. 

GEORGE

Yes.. 

JERRY

And you don't... 

GEORGE

Nooo... 

JERRY

So... 

GEORGE

Exactly.. 

JERRY

Hmmmm... 

GEORGE

We...must never ever speak of this again.. 

JERRY

No, no......(long pause . they stare at the walls) Hey uh.. you want to see a movie? 

GEORGE

Actually I think I'm gonna take a few days off (starts to leave) 

JERRY

I think that's for the best. 

GEORGE

(clears throat) Maura, I, uh- I want you to know... I-I've given this a lot of thought. I'm sorry, but... we, uh, we have to break up. 

MAURA

No. (sips her drink) 

GEORGE

(double takes) What's that? 

MAURA

We're not breaking up. (takes another sip) 

GEORGE

(puzzled) W-we're not? 

MAURA

No. (hands George his cup) 

GEORGE

All right (he smiles weakly at Maura) 

JERRY

She said no? 

GEORGE

She said no. 

JERRY

What did you do? 

GEORGE

What could I do?! We fooled around and went to a movie! 

JERRY

George, both parties don't have to consent to a break-up. It's not like you're launching missiles from a submarine and you both have to turn your keys. Obviously, you didn't make a convincing case. Let me hear your arguments. 

GEORGE

Well, I don't really like her. 

JERRY

That's good. 

GEORGE

I don't find her attractive. 

JERRY

Solid. 

GEORGE

I'd like to sleep with a LOT of other women. 

JERRY

Always popular. 

GEORGE

Sometimes at restaurants she talks to her food: 'Ooh, Mr. Mashed Potatoes, you are sooo goood.' 

JERRY

You have an airtight case! 

GEORGE

And in bed-- 

JERRY

I'm afraid we're out of time. 

JERRY

Hey. 

GEORGE

What? 

JERRY

Check these out. These are Jerry Lewis' old cufflinks that he actually wore in the movie 'Cinderfella'. I got 'em at an auction. 

GEORGE

I got some cufflinks I could've loaned you. 

JERRY

No, Jerry Lewis is gonna be at this Friar's Club roast I'm goin' to next week. Now I have an in to strike up a conversation with him. 

GEORGE

You already have an in. You have the same first name!... (no reaction) 'Jerry'! 

JERRY

Oh, that'll intrigue him. 

GEORGE

Well, it worked when I met George Peppard last week. 

JERRY

George Peppard has been dead for years. 

GEORGE

Well, whoever he was, he knew a lot about The A-Team! 

GLENN

So you would choose your last meal based on the method of execution? 

ELAINE

Right, right. I mean, if I was getting the chair, I'd go for something... hot and spicy, you know... Thai, maybe Mexican. Lethal injection, feels like pasta... you know, painless, don't want anything too heavy... 

GLENN

So, um, why don't we get together some time? 

ELAINE

Oh, sure! Why don't you give me your number? 

GLENN

I think it'd be better if I called you. 

ELAINE

Oh. OK. Maybe we could grab some lunch sometime. D-do you work around here or-? 

GLENN

Mm mm... no, not really. 

ELAINE

So, is there anything you can tell me about yourself? 

GLENN

(seductive tone) I think you're very beautiful. 

ELAINE

(flattered) Oh (laughs) That'll do! (laughs some more) 

JERRY

What about Puddy? 

ELAINE

I haven't talked to him in, like, three weeks... I THINK it might be over... 

JERRY

(unimpressed) So, what's this guy about? 

ELAINE

I don't know. He wouldn't tell me his phone number, where he worked... I'll bet he's in a relationship. 

JERRY

Or he's a crime fighter safeguarding his secret identity! Elaine, you could be dating the Green Lantern! 

ELAINE

Which one is he? 

JERRY

Green suit, power ring. 

ELAINE

I don't care for jewellery on men (wags her finger disapprovingly) 

KRAMER

Hey. It happened again. (puts box on counter) Another robbery in the building. 

JERRY

So you bought a cooler? 

KRAMER

No, it's a strongbox to protect my irreplaceables. 

ELAINE

And... what would those be? 

KRAMER

Some taxidermy that's been in my family for generations, my Tony, my... military discharge. 

JERRY

(doubtful) You were in the Army? 

KRAMER

Y- B-briefly. Now, I gotta find a good place to hide this key. Because if somebody finds this, they hold the key to all my possessions. (makes a clicking sound) 

ELAINE

Literally. 

KRAMER

(offended) 'Literally'? What's THAT supposed to mean? (then to Jerry, before Elaine can answer) You mind if I hide this somewhere? 

JERRY

No, go ahead. 

KRAMER

(stuttering gibberish, gestures that they should leave) A little... privacy, uh? 

JERRY

Oh, come on! 

ELAINE

Oh! 

KRAMER

Come on, Jerry, this is a security issue! (Elaine laughs) Boy, you wouldn't last a DAY in the Army. 

JERRY

(walking towards door with Elaine) How long did you last? (opens door) 

KRAMER

Well, that's classified. 

ELAINE

Hey, what if he's married? 

JERRY

Kramer?! 

ELAINE

No, the Green Lantern. 

KRAMER

(from inside) OK! 

JERRY

So, you would date a married guy? That's so hacky. 

ELAINE

Well, I don't know. I may never marry. It might be the closest I get. 

KRAMER

(bangs arm of couch in frustration) You peeked! 

JERRY

THIS is your hiding place?! (Elaine laughs) 

KRAMER

It was under a spoon! 

GEORGE

And so, for all these reasons, we are officially broken up. (shuts book and reaches for door) Thank you, (opens door) and good night. 

MAURA

No, George, we're not. 

GEORGE

(gestures towards book) But I proved it! 

MAURA

I refuse to give up on this relationship. It's like... launching missiles from a submarine. Both of us have to turn our keys. 

GEORGE

Well, then, I am gonna have to ask you to turn your key. 

MAURA

(assertive) I'm sorry, George, I can't do that. 

GEORGE

(shouting) Turn your key, Maura. Turn your key! 

ELAINE

So, how is a guy like you not involved? 

GLENN

I might ask you the same thing. 

ELAINE

(in her mind) That's true, maybe he's not married. 

ELAINE

Oh, that is so sweet. 

ELAINE

(in her mind, cynical) How long do I have to hold this? 

GLENN

(seeing a woman on the street) Oh, no. 

ELAINE

Who is it? 

GLENN

Um, uh, no one, no one. (running with Elaine into an alley) Here, uh, let me show you a short cut. Come on. Come on. 

ELAINE

(in her mind) Married. That's it, I'm chucking the flower. (she does) 

ELAINE

(shouting up) Jerry! Jerry! 

JERRY

Elaine, what are you doin' down there? 

ELAINE

You didn't hear me buzzing? 

JERRY

Oh, I guess it's broken! 

ELAINE

Throw down your key. 

JERRY

It's liable to bounce and go into a sewer. 

ELAINE

I'll catch it! 

JERRY

You'll chicken out at the last second. 

ELAINE

...Yeah, you're right. Well, will you at least keep me company until somebody comes out? 

JERRY

(annoyed) All right. (after a pause) Hey, you know what's weird? 

ELAINE

Huh? 

JERRY

I used to be able to have a huge meal and go right to sleep. But I can't anymore. 

ELAINE

Nodding off!... Well, I was right. He's an adulterer. And he's cheating on his wife with me! 

JERRY

All right. 

JERRY

Here! I'm gonna try and fix the buzzer. 

ELAINE

(from the street) It went in the sewer! (Jerry reacts) 

JERRY

Hey... 

KRAMER

(re buzzer box) What are you doin'? 

JERRY

(waving the key) You jammed your key in here? You shorted out my intercom! 

KRAMER

(grabbing the key) You just had to go lookin' for it, didn't you? See, you hate it that I have a little secret. Anything I do -- oooh, oooh! -- you gotta know all about it. You're so OBSESSED with me. 

JERRY

I'm gonna go let Elaine in. (Kramer reaches out to stop him leaving) 

KRAMER

Oo, y- what are you doing with her? (Jerry ignores him and exits) 

JERRY

(in the hallway, hearing the door lock behind him, turns back) Kramer! 

KRAMER

(from inside) Security issue! 

JERRY

Oh, hey. You got in. 

ELAINE

Yeah, flirted with the menu guy. Here. (hands him a large stack of papers) 

JERRY

(taking the menus) Oh, thanks. 

KRAMER

(clattering inside) That wasn't me! 

JERRY

So, he's definitely married, huh? 

ELAINE

Uh... 

JERRY

Boy, I would love to have been there when you told him off. 

JERRY

Oh, come on! 

ELAINE

Well, he could be a superhero! You should've seen him run. 

KRAMER

(from inside Jerry's apartment) OK! (door opens) 

KRAMER

All right, Jerry. Let's see if you can get it in your head that this is not an Easter egg hunt for your childish amusement. (shuts door) 

GEORGE

(from the street below Jerry's window) Jerry! 

JERRY

(out of window) George, the buzzer's broken! I'll come down! 

JERRY

(putting on his coat to go downstairs, he finds the key in his coat pocket) I believe this belongs to you. 

KRAMER

Heyyyy! (bangs the table in frustration and grabs the key) 

JERRY

(opens the door for George) Where did you get that? 

GEORGE

(puzzled) I bought it. (enters lobby) 

JERRY

(barring the way) I'm sorry. I-I don't know you. 

PHIL

What? 

JERRY

There's been some robberies in the building. I-I can't let you in. 

PHIL

But, I live here! I ran out to buy some birdseed, and-and I forgot my key. 

GEORGE

Sounds like a scam. (takes a bite from the granola bar) 

JERRY

(shakes his head) I'm very sorry. (closing the door on Phil. Jerry smiles and shrugs apologetically as Phil stares at them through the glass) 

GEORGE

So, I broke up with Maura. It's done. I'm out. 

JERRY

Great, you're lonely and miserable again. (presses button to call elevator) 

GEORGE

Feels right. (cheerfully takes another bite) 

JERRY

Is that guy still there? (They are side-on to Phil who is in the background, still pressed against the glass, aghast) 

GEORGE

(looking at the door) He's starin' at us. 

JERRY

Don't look at him. (Phil starts to knock on the door) 

JERRY

We don't hear that. (They enter the elevator) 

GEORGE

Want a bite? 

JERRY

Nooo, I don't. (the elevator doors shut) 

GEORGE

(in his mind) I think that ginger ale at the coffee shop is just Coke and Sprite mixed together. How can I prove it? Ah! Can't, dammit. (knock at door. George goes to open it) 

MAURA

(cheerily) Hey, Honey. (she sweeps in, shuts the door behind her, and sits down) 

GEORGE

(still by the door) What? M-Maura, what are you doin' here? I ended this relationship... twice! 

MAURA

George, you didn't mean that. That was just a fight. 

GEORGE

Why does it always seem like I'm the only one working at this break-up? 

MAURA

George, I listened to your arguments, and they were rambling and flimsy. I'm not convinced. Come on, get dressed and let's get some dinner. 

GEORGE

(pauses to consider this then gives in) All right. (starts heading towards bedroom) 

MAURA

(picking up the apple) Eww, Mr. Apple. You have a brown spot. (George freezes, shakes his head, and continues walking) 

ELAINE

So, this is your little... love nest? (laughs) 

GLENN

It's nothing special, just a little place I keep. 

ELAINE

Oh. 

GLENN

Ah, should I light a fire? 

ELAINE

Oh, that sounds... romantic. 

GLENN

I'm having a little problem with the heat. Um, I got some cardboard out here. (climbing through the window) 

ELAINE

(in her mind, anguished) This is wrong. I should go. (There's a knock at the door) 

GLENN

(leaning in) Can you get that, please? 

ELAINE

Oh, sure. 

WOMAN

Where's Glenn? 

ELAINE

(guiltily) Ah... You're the woman from the street, and I am so sorry. You know, I'm not really a home-wrecker. I-I-I-I-I thought he was a superhero. I swear. 

WOMAN

Lady, I'm not his wife, I'm his welfare caseworker. Is he home? 

ELAINE

This is his home? 

WOMAN

Yes. 

ELAINE

So, he's... 

WOMAN

(nodding) Poor. (Elaine mouths 'oo') 

GLENN

(coming back through the window carrying an old chair) I think this will burn! 

JERRY

So you do live here. 

PHIL

(sulkily) Yeah. (Jerry has an anguished expression as the elevator doors shut) 

JERRY

You live on this floor? 

PHIL

Yeah. 

JERRY

(arriving at apartment, sees Phil start to open his apartment door, only one door down from Kramer's) So you live right... there. 

PHIL

Yeah. (enters his apartment) 

JERRY

So I guess I'll s-- 

ELAINE

He wouldn't give me his number because he doesn't have a phone. (unwrapping a lollipop) He's not married. He's poor. (puts lollipop in her mouth) 

JERRY

Is he wretchedly poor? Does he wear one of those barrels with the straps? 

ELAINE

He probably busted it up and burned it for heat. 

JERRY

So, when are you giving Boxcar Willie his walking papers? 

ELAINE

How can I end it over money? I feel bad. 

JERRY

Well, let's think. Have you ever dealt with the poor in any other situation? 

ELAINE

Yes. There was this homeless guy who used to urinate on our garbage cans. 

JERRY

Good. How did you handle that? 

ELAINE

Well, we gave him a few bucks, and... now he goes in the alley across the street. 

JERRY

Same situation. Pay him off, and you're clean. 

ELAINE

Well, I am NOT paying Glenn off to get out of this relationship. Wh-what am I supposed to do, just walk into his hovel, and hand him... well, how much do you think it would be? 

GEORGE

(entering Monk's) Hey. 

JERRY

Hey, where have you been? 

GEORGE

(sitting down next to Jerry) Seeing Maura. Apparently, I was unable to break up beyond a reasonable doubt. 

ELAINE

If only he could have been cheating on his wife, you know, things would have been so much simpler. 

GEORGE

Who's this, Blue Arrow? 

ELAINE

Green Lantern. 

JERRY

We found out his super power was lack of money. 

ELAINE

(not amused) All right. 

JERRY

He's invulnerable to creditors. 

ELAINE

(annoyed) We get it. (George is laughing) 

JERRY

He's the Got-no-Green Lantern. 

ELAINE

Thank you. (gets up from her seat) 

GEORGE

Hey, Elaine. Maybe his girlfriend is Lois Loan. 

ELAINE

(leaning over to George) Ooh, (fake laugh) well crafted. (exits) 

GEORGE

Hey, maybe this cheating thing is what I could use to ditch Maura. 

JERRY

Sure, just tell Maura you're having an affair. 

GEORGE

She's like a district attorney. If it's not the truth, I'll break under the cross. I actually have to do it. 

JERRY

(fidgets like he has no room with George next to him)... Could you move over there?! 

GEORGE

Hey, you know, there's this secretary at work that always had a crush on me. 

JERRY

Really? How come you never pursued her before? 

GEORGE

She's too tanned. It's the middle of the winter, she's like a carrot. 

ELAINE

(coming back into Monk's) Did I leave my glasses here? 

JERRY

(to Elaine, still joking) He can wipe out his checking account in a single bounce! 

ELAINE

(leaving again) Keep 'em! (George and Jerry savour the joke) 

KRAMER

Heh. 

JERRY

There's a giant parrot in the hallway. 

KRAMER

It's Phil's. 

JERRY

Who? 

KRAMER

Our neighbor that you... turned against. (Jerry reacts) Anyway, I told him it'd be fine with us if he wanted to let it stretch its wings out in the hallway. 

JERRY

What'd ya tell him that for? 

KRAMER

Because since you've been playing God with the front door, I've been tryin' to smooth things out, Jerry. In fact, I was just hanging out at his place. 

JERRY

Really? What's it like? Is it nicer than mine? Where does he have the couch? 

KRAMER

Well, I don't know, but the key problem is solved. I hid it at Phil's... 

JERRY

He let you? 

KRAMER

No, he doesn't know. See, I hid it without tellin' him. So, uh, (starts walking towards door) Phil won't be compulsively looking for it like some people... You! (points at Jerry) 

GEORGE

So, you... you say you've been in the city all winter? 

LORETTA

I was in Maine for a couple days. (George looks puzzled at how she's so tanned) 

GEORGE

Well... (shuts door) heeere we are (puts down his coat and chuckles) 

LORETTA

George, I've always fantasized about jumping into bed with you. 

GEORGE

(excited) Ho ho! (gestures and steps towards bedroom but Loretta walks the other way to the couch) 

LORETTA

But... I don't want to spoil things by sleeping with you too soon. 

GEORGE

(walking back) Are you sure? 'Cause it could really help me out of a jam. 

LORETTA

I want to build something with you, George. 

GEORGE

Oh, not more building. 

LORETTA

(sighs) And I won't take no for an answer. (she sits down) 

GEORGE

No? 

LORETTA

No. 

GEORGE

(after hesitating, resignedly) All right. (He sits down and smiles unconvincingly at her) 

ELAINE

So, uh, what are we doing in this alley, anyway? 

GLENN

It's a surprise. 

ELAINE

(giggling) Oh. 

ELAINE

What are you doing? What is that? 

GLENN

It's a bag of donuts. 

ELAINE

It's garbage. 

GLENN

No, no, no, no. When they make the new ones, the old ones come out... right here. 

ELAINE

(has had enough) All right, that's it. (rummaging in purse, pulls out her chequebook) How do you spell your last name? 

GLENN

(still looking through the garbage bag) It's a bear claw! You have no idea how rare this is. 

ELAINE

(writing out cheque) I'll make it out to cash. How 'bout two hundred bucks? Two-fifty? 

GLENN

(eating the bear claw) Oooh! 

ELAINE

Make it three hundred. 

GLENN

(re the bear claw) You know, Elaine, you're the bear claw in the garbage bag of my life. (breaks bear claw in half and offers her a piece) 

ELAINE

(touched, she takes it) Aw, Glenn. 

JERRY

Hi. Is Phil here? 

JERRY

Phil... hi. I-I know we got off to kind of a bad start. But your bird, which is lovely... by the way, made a mess on my door. 

PHIL

And? 

JERRY

I thought maybe you'd clean it up, or your maid, there. 

PHIL

That's my wife. 

JERRY

(nodding awkwardly for a moment) All right, I think we're done here. (Jerry leaves and Phil shuts the door darkly) 

JERRY

(in a tuxedo) So, you're in a relationship with a woman you don't like, and you're having an affair with a woman that won't have sex with you. 

GEORGE

This isn't going well. 

JERRY

I cannot find my Jerry Lewis cufflinks. Without 'em, I have no in! 

GEORGE

You don't need the cufflinks! You have the same name! (no reaction) 'Jerry'! (heads for door, grabbing his coat) 

JERRY

Where are you goin'? Help me look! 

GEORGE

(opening door) It's a big night. I'm, uh, ice skating with one, and going to a staged reading of 'Godspell' with the other. 

JERRY

Which is with who? 

GEORGE

(shaking his head, weary) It doesn't matter. (he leaves) 

KRAMER

(entering Jerry's apartment, in his own tuxedo) Whoo! Boy. Yeah, you clean up nice. 

JERRY

I can't go until I find my cufflinks. 

KRAMER

Yeah, see? I knew you would lose 'em. That's why I took 'em out of your dresser drawer and put 'em in my strongbox. 

JERRY

You're a lifesaver. Would you get them, please? 

KRAMER

Yeah, we'll stop by Phil's, we'll pick up the key, uh? 

KRAMER

Hey, what's going on? 

PHIL

Fredo is dead. (his wife sobs) 

JERRY

That strange Portuguese guy that lives next-door to the incinerator? 

PHIL

No! My bird. We just got back from the pet cemetery. (starts opening door) 

JERRY

Oh, Phil... Mrs. Phil. I'm so sorry. 

PHIL

Oh, I'll bet you are! They told us he was poisoned! Something in his food. 

JERRY

But I, I didn't, I-- 

JERRY

Kramer, they think I killed Fredo! (Kramer gestures sympathetically) And who buries a bird? 

KRAMER

Yeah. Just give it to the Portuguese guy, and he... puts it in the incinerator. 

JERRY

Just get the key and let's get out of here. 

KRAMER

Yeah, yeah. (goes to Phil's door) You know, it's a... it's a funny thing about that bird dying. I hid the key in Fredo's food dish. Whoo! That's a weeeird coincidence. 

JERRY

Kramer!? (grabbing Kramer's arm roughly, pulling him back as he's about to knock) 

KRAMER

What? 

JERRY

You killed Fredo! 

KRAMER

(high-pitched) Well, Fredo was weak and stupid! He shouldn't have eaten that key! 

JERRY

Kramer, I need those cufflinks, but now they're in the box, and the key is in the bird... What are we gonna do? 

KRAMER

You just answered your own question. 

JERRY

(frowning in realization) Oh, no! 

KRAMER

(nodding) I'll get the shovel. (walks towards his apartment, as Jerry grimaces at the prospect) 

GEORGE

The, uh, actor that played Jesus made some odd choices. 

LORETTA

(shaking head, confused) What? 

GEORGE

I mean, uh... I had fun ice skating. 

LORETTA

Oh. (she smiles, reassured, and nods) 

MAURA

George? 

GEORGE

Maura. (starts acting dramatically, looking from Maura to Loretta and back again) Oh, my God! What are you doing here?! 

MAURA

You told me to meet you here for lunch. 

GEORGE

(standing up, still acting) Uhh! I'm caught in my own web of lies! (holds his hands up in surrender) 

MAURA

(calmly ignoring George) I'm Maura. (shaking Loretta's hand and smiling) 

LORETTA

(to Maura, also friendly) I'm Loretta. You want to join us? (Maura nods and sits down next to her) 

GEORGE

(laughs hysterically, gesticulating wildly) This is all blowing up in my face! My serious girlfriend, and my torrid love affair have accidentally crossed paths. I have ruined three lives... (grabbing coat) Well, I understand if you never want to see me again, so... (points towards door) 

MAURA

George, what we have is too important. We can work through this. 

LORETTA

So can we. 

GEORGE

(astounded) What? So, this is still not over? 

MAURA

No. 

GEORGE

You? 

LORETTA

No. 

GEORGE

All right. (throws his coat back down on the seat and sits down opposite them) 

GLENN

Elaine, wow, a TV, a stereo? 

ELAINE

Yeah, and I got you a cord of wood, so you won't have to burn 'em. 

GLENN

Oh, my God, Alison. You're home early. 

ELAINE

Who is this? 

ALISON

(arms crossed, angry) His wife. 

ELAINE

You're... poor AND married? 

GLENN

Looks like it. 

ALISON

Who the hell are you? 

ELAINE

I guess I'm... Lois Loan. 

JERRY

Kramer, I can't believe we're grave robbers. 

KRAMER

(reading a tombstone) 'Man's best friend'. Jerry, I want something like that on my tombstone. 

JERRY

(seeing Fredo's tombstone) Oh, my God. Here he is. I don't want to dig him up! (hands the shovel to Kramer) 

KRAMER

(sighs) All right, then you're the one getting the key out of him. 

JERRY

(grimaces and takes the shovel back) I'll dig. 

KRAMER

Listen, I heard that Lassie #3 is buried around here. I'm gonna go check it out. 

JERRY

(hitting metal with the first strike of the shovel) Well, that was easy. 

PHIL

All right, Honey, one last look, then you have to let Fredo rest in peace. 

JERRY

(with a wild expression) Hey, Kramer! I dug Fredo up, now let's cut him open! 

PHIL

(horrified) Oh, my God! 

JERRY

(after a very awkward pause, cheerily) Hey, neighbor. 

GEORGE

All right. I'm gonna try givin' them fifty-five dollars each... (to Elaine) What do you think? 

ELAINE

Give me forty, you'll never see me again. 

ELAINE

(to Jerry) So, what are you gonna do? Are you gonna live here, or are you gonna move out, or what? 

JERRY

(still in tuxedo, tie undone) Ah, I'll just take the fire escape to get in and out of the building. 

GEORGE

So, what's in the cooler? (flips open the lid) 

KRAMER

Oh. Well, would you look at that. (puts a gun-shaped hand to his head and goes 'Pop') I guess I forgot to lock it. 

JERRY

You mean it was open? We desecrated a pet cemetery for nothing? 

KRAMER

Well, this is one for the books, huh, Jerry?... Reeeally one for the books! 

GEORGE

When are they gonna learn that any news about China is an instant page-turner? (seeing Jerry with a small black device) What's that? 

JERRY

It's a Wizard electronic organizer for my dad. I'm goin' to Florida for his birthday. 

GEORGE

How much was it? 

JERRY

Two hundred. But I'll tell him it's fifty. He doesn't care about the gift. He gets excited about the deal. 

GEORGE

Where are you gettin' a Wizard for fifty dollars? 

JERRY

Ah, I'll tell him I got it on the street, and maybe it's hot. That's his favorite. 

GEORGE

I got a message from the Rosses at work today. 

JERRY

Susan's parents? When's the last time you talked to them? 

GEORGE

At the funeral, give or take. You know, deep down, I always kinda felt that they blamed me for Susan's death. 

JERRY

Why, because you picked out the poision envelopes? That's silly. 

ELAINE

(entering Monk's with her boyfriend) Oh, um... Darryl. These are... people I know. Jerry, George. 

DARRYL

Nice meeting you. Ah, I gotta run, Elaine. I'll see you later. 

ELAINE

OK. 

JERRY

Still no Puddy? 

ELAINE

Uh, I think his answering machine's broken, so I just gave up. Well, what do you think? 

JERRY

What? About you datin' a black guy? What's the big deal? 

ELAINE

What black guy? 

JERRY

Darryl. He's black, isn't he? 

ELAINE

He is? 

GEORGE

No, he isn't. 

JERRY

Isn't he, Elaine? 

ELAINE

You think? 

GEORGE

I thought he looked Irish. 

JERRY

What's his last name? 

ELAINE

Nelson. 

GEORGE

That's not Irish. 

JERRY

I think he's black. 

GEORGE

Should we be talkin' about this? 

ELAINE

I think it's OK. 

GEORGE

No, it isn't. 

JERRY

Why not? 

GEORGE

Well, it would be OK if Darryl was here. 

JERRY

If he's black. 

ELAINE

Is he black? 

JERRY

Does it matter? 

ELAINE

No, course not. I mean, I'd just like to know. 

JERRY

Oh, so you need to know? 

ELAINE

No, I don't need to know. I just think it would be nice if I knew. 

WAITRESS

Should I take that? 

JERRY

(getting out his wallet) Uh, one second. 

ELAINE

(looking in her purse) Oh, here. 

GEORGE

(pulling out some money) Uh, yeah. Hang on. Just... yeah. 

GEORGE

(on the phone) Uh, Mrs. Ross? It's-it's George. 

ROSS

Uh, who? 

GEORGE

George Costanza. Susan's, uh, friend? Long time no speak. 

ROSS

(walking by Mrs. Ross) We're all out of lime juice. I told that woman to buy more. 

ROSS

Uh, George, the Susan Ross Foundation is having an event this weekend. 

GEORGE

Oh, I just, uh, leased a house out in the Hamptons, and I have got to get out there this weekend and sign the papers. 

ROSS

(again walking by) I'm goin' back to bed. 

ROSS

Thank you for calling, George. 

GEORGE

Oh, sure. I mean, after all, you were almost my, uh... OK, I gotta go. 

JERRY

House in the Hamptons? 

GEORGE

Well, you know, I've been lyin' about my income for a few years. I figured I could afford a fake house in the Hamptons. 

KRAMER

(enters) Well. 

JERRY

Hey. 

KRAMER

Well, grab a cigar, boys. Yeah. It's time to celebrate. 

JERRY

Wow. What are we celebrating? 

KRAMER

Uh, you remember my coffee table book? 

JERRY

With the little legs? 

KRAMER

That's the one. A big Hollywood so-and-so optioned it for a movie. 

GEORGE

How are they gonna make that book into a movie? 

KRAMER

You remember that photo book on toy ray guns? 

GEORGE

Yeah? 

KRAMER

Independence Day? 

GEORGE

Oh. 

JERRY

How much are they payin' you? 

KRAMER

Let's just say that I don't have to worry about working for a while. A long while. 

JERRY

That's funny because I haven't seen you working for a while. A long while. 

KRAMER

Yeah, and you're not going to, because I'm hanging it up. Boys, I'm retiring. 

JERRY

From what? 

KRAMER

From the grind. I mean, who needs it? I mean, I've accomplished everything I've set out to do. 

JERRY

(seeing that Kramer has a new watch) What's that? 

KRAMER

Oh, I bought myself a little retirement gift. Gold watch. 

GEORGE

Ooh! 

KRAMER

Well, it's not really gold. 

GEORGE

Aww. 

ELAINE

(as Darryl opens his door) Hey. 

DARRYL

Hey. 

ELAINE

Great music. 

DARRYL

Oh, it's my neighbor. They blast that stuff twenty four hours a day. I hate it. 

DARRYL

Yo, you! Turn it down! 

ELAINE

Oh, wow, these are nice. Do they have any cultural significance? 

DARRYL

They're... African. 

ELAINE

Right. African. 

DARRYL

Well, not Africa, actually. South Africa. 

ELAINE

South Africa. 

DARRYL

My family used to live there, but, uh, we got out years ago, for obvious reasons. You know how it is. 

ELAINE

Maybe. 

GEORGE

(to a street vender selling hot dogs) You must hate hot dogs, huh? Or else, you, uh, you really like 'em and that's why you, you do this. 

GEORGE

I'll tell ya, if I had one of these things, I'd be eatin' hot dogs all the time. 

VENDER

Are you gonna buy a hot dog or not? 

GEORGE

Mmm... no. 

MORTY

(Jerry comes out of his room, having just woken up) Rise and shine, sleepy head! Ha ha! 

JERRY

It's 5:30 in the morning! 

HELEN

We let you sleep in. 

JERRY

(handing his dad a gift) Well, as long as I'm up. Dad, I got you a birthday present. Here. Happy Birthday. 

MORTY

Aw, Jerry. I should be buyin' you presents. 

JERRY

What does that mean? 

HELEN

Leave your father alone. It's his birthday. 

MORTY

Oooh! Heh heh! It's a radar detector. 

JERRY

Radar detector? I've never seen you go over twenty miles an hour. You're like the Grand Marshall of the Rose Bowl Parade. It's a Wizard organizer. 

MORTY

This looks like too much money. 

JERRY

Nah, I got it from a guy on the street. It was, like, fifty bucks. 

MORTY

You think it's hot? 

JERRY

Could be. 

MORTY

Attaboy! Helen, Jerry got me a hot Wizard computer! 

HELEN

I'm right here. 

JERRY

And you can do everything with it. You can get e-mail, fax, there's a calculator. 

MORTY

So, I can use it in the restaurant to figure out the tip? 

JERRY

Yeah, I guess. But the really cool thing is the daily planner. 

MORTY

Helen, we got into restaurants and figure out the tips. 

HELEN

Jerry, you're getting your father too excited. 

KRAMER

(entering the condo, and going to the fridge as if he's a neighbor) Hey, buddy. When'd you get here? 

JERRY

Kramer, what are you doing here? 

KRAMER

I told you I was retiring. I moved in next door. 

HELEN

Mr. Kornstein died, and it's a beautiful apartment. 

KRAMER

Yeah, your, uh, folks said it was for rent, so I jumped on it. 

JERRY

Kramer, you can't live down here. This is where people come to die. 

JERRY

(getting looks from his parents) Not you. Older people. 

HELEN

Don't eat cookies for breakfast! I'll fix you something. How 'bout a feta cheese omelette? 

KRAMER

Mmmm, that sounds great, Mom. 

JERRY

If you feed him, he'll never leave. 

HELEN

We don't have any feta. How about cottage cheese and Egg Beaters? 

KRAMER

(immaturely) I guess. 

JERRY

I can't believe this. 

KRAMER

I know, I know. Don't I look more relaxed? 

ELAINE

So, George, do you have any thoughts on this Darryl situation? 

GEORGE

Actually, I did have a thought. 

ELAINE

Oh. 

GEORGE

Why don't you just ask him? 

ELAINE

(rudely and giving him a 'duh' look) Because, if I ask him, then it's like I really want to know. 

GEORGE

Maybe he's, um... mixed. 

ELAINE

Is that the right word? 

GEORGE

I really don't think we're supposed to be talkin' about this. 

ELAINE

Yeah. 

GEORGE

(standing up) I'm just gonna go to the bathroom. 

ELAINE

(starting to leave) You know what, I'm leavin'. 

GEORGE

Yeah. 

ELAINE

I'll just talk to Jerry when he gets back. (seeing the Rosses entering Monk's) Oh. Mrs. Ross, Mr. Ross. 

ROSS

Oh, you're George's friend. 

ROSS

We saw him in the city this weekend. Uh, what happened to his place in the Hamptons? 

ELAINE

(laughing uproariously) The Hamptons? George Costanza? I, uh... I don't think so. Have a good one. 

GEORGE

Rosses. 

ROSS

George, we were just talking about you. 

GEORGE

Well, sorry I missed that, uh, charity thing. But this was one of those truly glorious Hampton weekends that you always hear about. 

ROSS

Really? 

GEORGE

Yeah, I may move out there. (getting 'yeah, right' glances from the Rosses) I mean it, I'll do it! OK, I'll see ya later. Keep it real! 

MORTY

(eating lunch with Helen and Jerry) Another fine meal, and now for my Wizard tip calculator. 

JERRY

Dad, it's got lots of other functions. 

MORTY

Don't worry. I'll get to the other functions. (trying to open it) I can't get it open. 

HELEN

Yay! Jerry got it open. 

MORTY

The service was slow. And God forbid they should refill the water. How does 12.4% sound? 

JERRY

(looking at the Wizard) Well, your tip is four dollars and thirty-six point six six six six cents. 

MORTY

We'll round down. 

HELEN

Jerry, it was so nice of you to come down here on your father's birthday. You've helped take his mind off the condo elections. 

JERRY

Oh, right. You can't run for condo president because you were impeached at the other condo. 

MORTY

I was never impeached! I resigned! 

HELEN

Even so, the press would bury him! 

JERRY

What press? 

HELEN

The condo newsletter, the Boca Breeze. 

MORTY

Pinko Commie rag. 

MAN

(coming up to the three Seinfelds) Hey, Morty. Your boy here, he just got a date with that young aquacise instructor. 

JERRY

She's fifty. 

MAN

You know what he's got? He's got charisma. That's my man. 

KRAMER

All right, I'll see you guys. 

MAN

Yeah. 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

KRAMER

(taping Morty's glasses) Morty, what're you lookin' at? 

MORTY

I'll tell you what I'm looking at: the next condo president of Del Boca Vista, Phase Three. 

KRAMER

Hmm. 

DARRYL

Elaine, thank you for the Wizard! 

DARRYL

Wow, it's got so many functions. 

ELAINE

Yeah, yeah. Forget about all that. First thing is first. Warranty information. Name, we know that. Uh, hobbies. Skiing, racquetball... 

DARRYL

Well, I don't do that stuff. 

ELAINE

It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter. Um. Oh, here's one: race. 

DARRYL

Isn't that optional? 

ELAINE

It certainly should be. It's nobody's damn business! But they really would like to know. 

DARRYL

All right, I'm... Asian. 

ELAINE

What? 

DARRYL

Just to mess with 'em. 

ELAINE

laughing awkwardly: Oh. Right. Good one. 

DARRYL

Average income, uh... over a hundred thousand. 

ELAINE

Really? 

DARRYL

Does that matter? 

ELAINE

No, but... it is very nice to know. 

JERRY

(in his parent's condo, on the phone with Elaine) So did you figure out Darryl's... you know. 

ELAINE

(in Jerry's apartment) Ah, I've given up. So, now we're going to a bunch of Spanish restaurants. I figure that'll cover us either way. 

JERRY

(as Kramer walks by) You're a master of race relations. 

ELAINE

Hey, so Kramer's running for president of the condo? 

JERRY

Yeah, it's all my father's doing. 

JERRY

He wants to install Kramer in a puppet regime and then wield power from behind the scenes. Preferably from the sauna in the clubhouse. 

ELAINE

Oh, heh heh heh. Who are they running against? 

JERRY

Common sense and a guy in a wheelchair. 

GEORGE

(entering Jerry's apartment) Jerry? 

ELAINE

(to George) He's still down with his folks. 

GEORGE

(to Elaine) What are you doin' here? 

JERRY

(overhearing the other two: Elaine, Elaine-- 

ELAINE

(to George) I'm gettin' his mail. 

JERRY

(overhearing the other two) Oh, no. 

GEORGE

(to Elaine) He asked you to get the mail? 

ELAINE

(to George) Mm-hmm. 

GEORGE

(taking the phone from Elaine) Jerry, why is Elaine getting your mail? 

JERRY

George, listen to me. I have a very important job for you. I want you to come by twice a day and flush the toilet so the gaskets don't dry out and leak. 

ELAINE

(trying to understand what they're talking about) What? 

GEORGE

What about the mail? 

JERRY

This is far more important. You must exercise the gaskets, George. 

GEORGE

(hanging up) All right, Jerry. I'll do it. See ya. 

GEORGE

So, I ran into the Rosses again. 

ELAINE

Oh, right, at the coffee shop. Where did they get the idea that you have a place in the Hamptons? 

GEORGE

From me. 

ELAINE

What did you say? 

GEORGE

I told them I have a place in the Hamptons. What did you say? 

ELAINE

I told them you didn't. And I laughed and I laughed. 

GEORGE

So, they knew? Those liars! 

ELAINE

But you lied first. 

GEORGE

Yeah, but they let me go on and on all about the Hamptons, they never said a thing! You don't let somebody lie when they know you're lying. You call them a liar! 

ELAINE

Like you're a liar! 

GEORGE

Yes. Thank you! Is that so hard? 

ELAINE

So, this is over, not over? I'm bettin', not over. 

GEORGE

Hmm-hmm, not by a long shot. I'm calling up the Rosses and inviting them up to my non-existent place in the Hamptons. Then we'll see who blinks first. 

ELAINE

Haven't you done enough to these people? 

GEORGE

This is not about them. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to exercise Jerry's gaskets. 

KRAMER

(to a room) Vote for Kramer. (to a man walking by) Cosmo Kramer. I'm running for condo president. I'd like your vote. Thanks. (to an old woman) Remember, ma'am, a vote for me, is a vote for Kramer. 

WOMAN

Will you cut my meat? 

KRAMER

Gladly. 

WAITRESS

(to Darryl) Coffee? 

DARRYL

Sure. 

WAITRESS

(to Darryl) Are you black? Or should I bring some cream. 

DARRYL

I'm black. (re-thinking) Oh, you know what? Bring a little cream. (seeing a couple gesturing towards him and Elaine) Did you hear that? 

ELAINE

What? 

DARRYL

God, there are still people who have trouble with an interracial couple. 

ELAINE

Interracial? Us? 

DARRYL

Isn't that unbelievable!? 

ELAINE

Yes, it's awful! They're upset because we're an interracial couple. That is racism! 

DARRYL

I don't feel like eating. 

ELAINE

Me neither. Well, maybe this turkey club. 

GEORGE

So... here I am. Ready to take you to the Hamptons. 

ROSS

Sounds grand. 

GEORGE

Do you have your bathing suits? 

ROSS

It's March. 

GEORGE

Speak now, or we are headed to the Hamptons. It's a two-hour drive. Once you get in that car, we are going all the way... to the Hamptons. All right, you wanna get nuts? Come on. Let's get nuts! 

JERRY

(in his parent's condo, to his father, who's in another room) Hey, Dad. You know you can program this thing to beep every time you need to take a vitamin. (as Kramer comes walking out in a retirement-like athletic sweatsuit) Dad, you look so different. 

KRAMER

Oh, no. We're campaigning, Jerry. To rule the people, one... must walk among them. 

MORTY

(coming into the hall) This is the home stretch. Tomorrow's the election! 

KRAMER

Right. Yeah. The polls close after dinner, three o'clock. But then when we win, the celebration goes all night until the break of eight p.m. 

JERRY

You know, you can put that whole schedule right in your daily planner. 

MORTY

Daily what? 

HELEN

(coming into the condo) Have you read today's Boca Breeze? 

KRAMER

(looking at the newsletter) Hey, look at that. Picture of me, huh? (reading out loud) Candidate Cosmo Kramer caught barefoot in clubhouse. 

MORTY

Barefoot in the clubhouse? Don't you realize this is against the rules. 

KRAMER

Well, I couldn't find my shoes. 

JERRY

Kramer, these people work and wait their whole lives to move down here, sit in the heat, pretend it's not hot, and enforce these rules. 

HELEN

Who wants hot chocolate? 

KRAMER

Oh, yeah! Me. 

MORTY

This is a huge scandal! We need damage control. 

KRAMER

All right, look. People seem to like those tip calculators, huh? 

JERRY

Wizards! 

KRAMER

Yeah, well, how 'bout if we give one out to every member on the condo board. 

JERRY

Kramer... 

MORTY

There are twenty people on the board. Thank God you can get that deal. 

KRAMER

Payoffs. Now we're playin' politics. All right, what do we next, Morty, huh? Wiretaps, slush funds? 

MORTY

(rushing to his bedroom) First, I need a nap. 

HELEN

(running after him) Oh, I'll get your electric blanket! 

JERRY

Kramer, I can't get that many Wizards. 

KRAMER

Well, what about your deal, huh? 

JERRY

I didn't have a deal! They're two hundred dollars a pop. What do I do? 

KRAMER

Well, don't worry about it. I know a guy. 

JERRY

Down here? 

KRAMER

Yeah, Bob Saccamano's father. 

ROSS

Tell us more. 

GEORGE

You want to hear more? The master bedroom opens into the solarium. 

ROSS

Another solarium? 

GEORGE

Yes, two solariums. Quite a find. And I have horses, too? 

ROSS

What are their names? 

GEORGE

Snoopy and Prickly Pete. Should I keep driving? 

ROSS

Oh, look, an antique stand. Pull over. We'll buy you a housewarming gift. 

GEORGE

(chuckling to himself) Housewarming gift. (swerving the car to go to the antique stand) All right, we're taking it up a notch! 

WAITRESS

(handing Elaine a menu) Here you go. 

ELAINE

(to the black waitress) Long day? 

WAITRESS

Yeah, I just worked a triple shift. 

ELAINE

I hear ya, Sister. 

WAITRESS

Sister? 

ELAINE

(as Darryl comes into Monk's) Yeah. It's OK. My boyfriend's black. Here he is. See? 

DARRYL

Hi, Elaine. 

ELAINE

Hey. 

WAITRESS

He's black? 

ELAINE

Yeah. 

DARRYL

I'm black? 

ELAINE

Aren't you? 

WAITRESS

(leaving) I'll give you a couple minutes to decide. 

DARRYL

What are you talking about? 

ELAINE

You're black. You said we were an interracial couple. 

DARRYL

We are. Because you're Hispanic. 

ELAINE

I am? 

DARRYL

Aren't you? 

ELAINE

No. Why would you think that? 

DARRYL

Your name's Benes, your hair, and you kept taking me to those Spanish restaurants. 

ELAINE

That's because I thought you were black. 

DARRYL

Why would you take me to a Spanish restaurant because I'm black? 

ELAINE

I don't think we should be talking about this. 

DARRYL

So, what are you? 

ELAINE

I'm white. 

DARRYL

So, we're just a couple of white people? 

ELAINE

I guess. 

DARRYL

Oh. 

ELAINE

Yeah. So do you want to go to the Gap? 

DARRYL

(leaving with Elaine) Sure. 

KRAMER

(having lunch with Jerry and his parents) Oh, well... I handed out all the Wizards. Polls close in one hour. Whoo hoo hoo! I think we've got this baby all sewn up, huh? Oh, uh, there was an extra one. Norman Burgerman, he won't be leavin' any tips where he is. 

JERRY

Aw. 

MORTY

Congratulations, Mr. President. 

KRAMER

Congratulations, Mr. Puppet Master. 

MAN

Hey, Morty, what's wrong with these tip calculators? 

MORTY

What are you talking about? 

MAN

It's overtipping. I just left five bucks for a BLT. 

MORTY

This isn't a Wizard, it's a Willard. 

JERRY

A Willard? Saccamano, Sr. screwed me! 

MORTY

Jerry, why didn't you get them Wizards? 

JERRY

Because a real Wizard's two hundred dollars. 

MORTY

You didn't have a deal? 

JERRY

No deal. Not hot. 

MAN

Morty, you, and Kramer, you're finished. 

KRAMER

What? 

MAN

Everyone vote for the guy in the wheelchair. 

KRAMER

(getting up to leave) Well, the people have spoken. Well, that's it for me. I'm, I'm headin' back to New York. 

JERRY

Dad, I'm sorry. 

MORTY

You should be! How could you spend two hundred dollars on a tip calculator?! 

JERRY

It does other things! 

ROSS

Where are we, George? 

GEORGE

Almost there. 

ROSS

Well, this is the end of Long Island. Where's your house? 

GEORGE

We, uh, we go on foot from here. 

ROSS

All right. 

GEORGE

There's no house! It's a lie! There's no solarium. There's no Prickly Pete. There's no other solarium. 

ROSS

We know. 

GEORGE

Then, why? Why did you make me drive all the way out here? Why didn't you say something? Why? Why? Why? 

ROSS

We don't like you, George. 

ROSS

And we always blamed you for what happened to Susan. 

GEORGE

Oh. 

ROSS

All right! Let's head back. 

PUDDY

Alright, be careful with the car, babe. 

ELAINE

Yeah, yeah. 

PUDDY

And don't move the seat, I got it right where I like it. 

ELAINE

Goodbye? 

PUDDY

Two and ten, babe. 

ELAINE

Okay. 

PUDDY

Don't peel out. 

ELAINE

I won't. 

ELAINE

Jesus? 

KRUGER

According to our latest quarterly thing,Kruger Industrial Smoothing is heading into the red. Or the black, or whatever the bad one is. Any thoughts? 

GEORGE

Well, I know when I'm a little strapped, I sometimes drop off my rent check having forgotten to sign it. That could buy us some time. 

KRUGER

Works for me. Good thinking, George. 

GEORGE

Or we don't even send the check and then when they call, we pretend we're the cleaning service. Heh heh. 'Hello? I sorry, no here Kruger.' 

KRUGER

Are you done? Silly voices, c'mon people, let's get real. 

GEORGE

I had 'em, Jerry. They loved me. 

JERRY

And then? 

GEORGE

I lost them. I can usually come up with one good comment during a meeting but by the end it's buried under a pile of gaffs and bad puns. 

JERRY

Showmanship, George. When you hit that high note, you say goodnight and walk off. 

GEORGE

I can't just leave. 

JERRY

That's the way they do it in Vegas. 

GEORGE

You never played Vegas. 

JERRY

I hear things. 

ELAINE

Here's one. I borrowed Puddy's car and all the presets on his radio were Christian rock stations. 

GEORGE

I like Christian rock. It's very positive. It's not like those real musicians who think they're so cool and hip. 

ELAINE

So, you think that Puddy actually believes in something? 

JERRY

It's a used car, he probably never changed the presets. 

ELAINE

Yes, he is lazy. 

JERRY

Plus he probably doesn't even know how to program the buttons. 

ELAINE

Yes, he is dumb. 

JERRY

So you prefer dumb and lazy to religious? 

ELAINE

Dumb and lazy, I understand. 

GEORGE

Tell you how you could check. 

ELAINE

How? 

GEORGE

Reprogram all the buttons, see if he changes them back. You know? The old switcheroo. 

JERRY

No, no, the old switcheroo is you poison your drink then you switch it with the other person's. 

GEORGE

No, it's doing the same thing to someone that they did to you. 

JERRY

Yeah, Elaine's gonna do the same thing to Puddy's radio that the radio did to her. 

GEORGE

Well that's the gist of it! 

ELAINE

Quiet! So where is this Sophie? 

JERRY

Oh, she's picking me up in a few minutes. 

ELAINE

How long have you two been together? 

JERRY

I dunno. Since the last one. Oh, here she is. You wanna meet her? 

GEORGE

Nah. 

GEORGE

By the way, how did Puddy get back in the picture? 

ELAINE

I needed to move a bureau. 

KRAMER

Hey Jerry, you got any pepper? 

MICKEY

Hey Jerry. 

JERRY

Hey Mickey. Check the pepper shaker. 

KRAMER

Yeah. (inhales some pepper then sneezes violently) See? It should sound like that, something like that. 

MICKEY

Aah-choo. 

KRAMER

A little wetter. See, I didn't believe it. 

JERRY

What's with the fake sneezing? 

KRAMER

Yeah, we're going down to Mt. Sinai Hospital, See they hire actors to help the students practice diagnosing. 

MICKEY

They assign you a specific disease and you act out the symptoms. It's an easy gig. 

JERRY

Do medical schools actually do this? 

KRAMER

Well the better ones. Alright, let's practice retching. 

MICKEY

HUAAHHH!! 

JERRY

I think the phone is ringing. 

MICKEY

HUAAHHH!! 

JERRY

Would you hold it a second?! Thank you, will you get out of here with that stuff? 

KRAMER

Mickey, DTs. 

JERRY

Hello? 

SOPHIE

Hey. It's me. 

JERRY

Elaine? 

SOPHIE

No, it's me. 

JERRY

George?? 

SOPHIE

Jerry, it's Sophie. I can't believe you don't recognize my voice. 

JERRY

Oh, I knew it was you, I was joking. I'm a comedian. 

KRAMER

You got any Ipecac? 

JERRY

Ipecac? Kramer, I really think you guys are going too far with this. 

KRAMER

No, Mickey, he swallowed twelve aspirin. 

JERRY

Did he overdose? 

KRAMER

No, it's just too much. 

KRUGER

...And it gets worse. The team working on the statue in Lafayette Square kind of over-smoothed it. They ground the head down to about the size of a softball, and that spells trouble. 

GEORGE

Alright, well why don't we smooth the head down to nothing, stick a pumpkin under its arm and change the nameplate to Ichabod Crane? 

GEORGE

(getting up and leaving) Alright! That's it for me. Goodnight everybody. 

WEXLER

In your packet you will find the disease you have been assigned and the symptoms you will need to exhibit. 

MICKEY

Bacterial Meningitis. Jackpot! 

KRAMER

Gonorrhea? You wanna trade? 

MICKEY

Sorry buddy, this is the 'Hamlet' of diseases. Severe pain, nausea, delusions, it's got everything. 

MAN

Sure. 

KRAMER

Okay, what do you got? 

MAN

The surgeon left a sponge inside me. 

KRAMER

Good luck with that. 

GEORGE

I knew I had hit my high note so I thanked the crowd and I was gone. 

JERRY

What did you do the rest of the day? 

GEORGE

I saw 'Titanic'. So that old woman, she's just a liar, right? 

JERRY

And a bit of a tramp if you ask me. 

ELAINE

Hello boys. 

GEORGE

Hey, so, did you give that radio the old switcheroo? 

ELAINE

I did. 

GEORGE

And the Christian rock? 

ELAINE

Ressurected! And look what I pried off of his bumper, a Jesus fish! 

GEORGE

Jerry, do you have any fishsticks? 

JERRY

No. So you're disappointed he's a spiritual person? 

ELAINE

Well yeah, I got him because he seemed so one-dimensional, I feel misled. 

GEORGE

I think it's neat. You don't hear that much about god anymore. 

JERRY

I hear things. Hey, so Sophie gave me the 'It's me' on the phone today. 

ELAINE

'It's me?' Isn't it a little premature? 

JERRY

I thought so. 

ELAINE

Hah. She's not a 'me'. I'm a 'me'. 

GEORGE

I'm against all 'it's me's. So self-absorbed and egotistical, it's like those hip musicians with their complicated shoes! 

KRAMER

Well, I got gonorrhea. 

ELAINE

That seems about right. 

KRAMER

That's what they gave me. 

GEORGE

They? The Government? 

JERRY

No, no. He's pretending he's got gonorrhea so med students can diagnose it. 

KRAMER

And it's a waste of my talent. It's just a little burning. Mickey, he got bacterial meningitis. 

GEORGE

I guess there are no small diseases, only small actors. 

GEORGE

(leaving) Alright that's it for me. Good night everybody. 

ELAINE

What was that? 

JERRY

Showmanship, George is trying to get out on a high note. 

KRAMER

See, showmanship. Maybe that's what my gonorrhea is missing. 

JERRY

Yes! Step into that spotlight and belt that gonorrhea out to the back row. 

KRAMER

Yes, yes I will! I'm gonna make people feel my gonorrhea, and feel the gonorrhea themselves. 

KRAMER

Just a little burning during urination. 

KRAMER

The haunting memories of lost love. May I? (signals to Mickey) Lights? (Mickey turns down the lights and Kramer lights a cigar) Our eyes met across the crowded hat store. I, a customer, and she a coquettish haberdasher. Oh, I pursued and she withdrew, then she pursued and I withdrew, and so we danced. I burned for her, much like the burning during urination that I would experience soon afterwards. 

KRAMER

Gonorrhea! 

JERRY

One message. Hope it's not from you. 

MACHINE

'Hey Jerry, it's me. Call me back.' 

JERRY

Sophie. 

GEORGE

She's still doing that? 

JERRY

Yep. 

GEORGE

Alright, I'll tell you what you do. You call her back and give her the 'it's me', heh? Pull the old switcheroo. 

JERRY

I think that's a 'what's good for the goose is good for the gander'. 

GEORGE

What the hell is a gander, anyway? 

JERRY

(picking up the phone and dialing) It's a goose that's had the old switcheroo pulled on it. Hi Sophie, it's me. 

SOPHIE

Hey Raef. 

JERRY

(to George) She thinks it's someone named Raef. 

GEORGE

Good, let her think it. 

JERRY

(into the phone, with a disguised voice) So, what's going on? 

SOPHIE

Not a lot. 

GEORGE

Ask about you, ask about you. 

JERRY

So, uh, how are things with Jerry? 

SOPHIE

Oh, I really like him but, well, I still haven't told him the tractor story. 

JERRY

Right, right, the tractor story. 

SOPHIE

Are you sick, Raef? You sound kinda funny. 

JERRY

I sound funny? 

GEORGE

Abort! Abort! 

JERRY

Yeah I better get to a doctor, bye. (Hangs up) That was close! What drives me to take chances like that? 

GEORGE

That was very real. 

JERRY

She said there's some tractor story that she hasn't told me about. 

GEORGE

Woah, back it up, back it up. Beep, beep, beep. Tractor story? 

JERRY

Beep, beep, beep? What are you doing? 

ELAINE

So where do you wanna eat? 

PUDDY

Feels like an Arby's night. 

ELAINE

Arby's. Beef and cheese and do you believe in god? 

PUDDY

Yes. 

ELAINE

Oh. So, you're pretty religious? 

PUDDY

That's right. 

ELAINE

So is it a problem that I'm not really religious? 

PUDDY

Not for me. 

ELAINE

Why not? 

PUDDY

I'm not the one going to hell. 

GEORGE

You know what I think? I bet she stole a tractor. 

JERRY

No one's stealing a tractor, it's a five-mile-an-hour getaway. We're dancing around the obvious, it's gotta be disfigurement. 

GEORGE

Does she walk around holding a pen she never seems to need? 

JERRY

No, she looks completely normal. 

GEORGE

Oh. Okay, here it is, I got it. She lost her thumbs in a tractor accident and they grafted her big toes on. They do it every day. 

JERRY

You think she's got toes for thumbs? 

GEORGE

How's her handshake? A little firm, isn't it? Maybe a little too firm? 

JERRY

I don't know. 

GEORGE

Hands a little smelly? 

JERRY

Why do I seek your counsel? 

ELAINE

Well I'm going to hell. 

JERRY

That seems about right. 

ELAINE

According to Puddy. 

JERRY

Hey, have you heard the one about the guy in hell with the coffee and the doughtnuts and-- 

ELAINE

I'm not in the mood. 

GEORGE

(To a passing waitress) I'll have some coffee and a doughnut. 

JERRY

What do you care? You don't believe in hell. 

ELAINE

I know, but he does. 

JERRY

So it's more of a relationship problem than the final destination of your soul. 

ELAINE

Well, relationships are very important to me. 

JERRY

Maybe you can strike one up with the prince of darkness as you burn for all eternity. 

GEORGE

(to the waitress bringing his doughnut) And a slice of devil's food cake. 

GEORGE

Hey. Where is everyone? 

KRUGER

They're all off the project. They were boring. George, you are my main man. 

GEORGE

I am? 

KRUGER

I don't know what it is, I can't put my finger on it, but lately you have just seemed 'on'. And you always leave me wanting more. 

GEORGE

This is a huge project involving lots of numbers and papers and folders. 

KRUGER

Ah, I'm not too worried about it. Let's get started. 

GEORGE

Okay. 

KRUGER

George? Check it out. (He begins to spin around in his chair) Three times around, no feet. 

GEORGE

And? 

KRUGER

All me. 

WEXLER

Alright, and here are you ailments for this week. By the way, Mr. Kramer, you were excellent. 

KRAMER

Oh, thank you. 

MICKEY

Cirrhosis of the liver with jaundice! Alright I get to wear make-up! What did you get? 

KRAMER

Gonorrhea? Excuse me, I think there's been a mistake, see, I had gonorrhea last week. 

WEXLER

Oh, it's no mistake. We loved what you did with it. 

KRAMER

I don't believe this, I'm being typecast. 

SOPHIE

I move my knight... here. Check. 

JERRY

They should update these pieces, nobody rides horses anymore. Maybe they should change it to a tractor. 

SOPHIE

Jerry, are you embarrassed that you're losing? 

JERRY

Losing? You know, yesterday I lost control of my car, almost bought the farm. 

SOPHIE

Bought the farm? 

JERRY

Tractor! 

SOPHIE

This is an odd side of you, Jerry. I feel uncomfortable. 

JERRY

Wait, don't go. Let's thumb wrestle. 

GEORGE

A scar? 

JERRY

A big long scar where her leg would dangle when she's riding a...? 

GEORGE

A tractor. 

JERRY

I'm sure she's a little self-conscious and doesn't like to talk about it. 

GEORGE

I don't see why's she more self-conscious about that than her toe thumbs. 

JERRY

She doesn't have toe thumbs. 

GEORGE

Well, if she keeps horsing around with that tractor-- 

JERRY

Alright. So how's the two-man operation at Kruger? 

GEORGE

Two-man? It's all me. Kruger doesn't do anything; Disappears for hours at a time, gives me fake excuses. This afternoon I found him with sleep creases on his face. The only reason I got out to get a bite today was that he finally promised to buckle down and do some actual work. (turning around, George sees Mr. Kruger at a booth eating a piece of cake) Oh, I don't believe this. This is what I have to put up with, Jerry. (He walks over) Mr. Kruger? Who said he was going to do some actual work today? Who? 

KRUGER

I'm not too worried about it. 

GEORGE

Well I am. Couldn't you try to go through some of that stuff I put in your shoebox? 

KRUGER

Alright, alright I'm going. 

GEORGE

(to Jerry) Huh-ho! Have you ever seen anything like this? 

JERRY

Never. 

PUDDY

Elaine, they forgot to deliver your paper today. Why don't you just grab that one. 

ELAINE

'Cause that belongs to Mr. Potato Guy, that's his. 

PUDDY

C'mon, get it. 

ELAINE

Well if you want it, you get it. 

PUDDY

Sorry, thou shalt not steal. 

ELAINE

Oh, but it's ok for me? 

PUDDY

What do you care, you know where you're going. 

ELAINE

Alright, that is it! I can't live like this. 

PUDDY

Nah. 

ELAINE

C'mon. 

PUDDY

Alright, what did I do? 

ELAINE

David, I'm going to hell! The worst place in the world! With devils and those caves and the ragged clothing! And the heat! My god, the heat! I mean, what do you think about all that? 

PUDDY

Gonna be rough. 

ELAINE

Uh, you should be trying to save me! 

PUDDY

Don't boss me! This is why you're going to hell. 

ELAINE

I am not going to hell and if you think I'm going to hell, you should care that I'm going to hell even though I am not. 

PUDDY

You stole my Jesus fish, didn't you? 

ELAINE

Yeah, that's right! 

MICKEY

Oh, my liver! Why did I drink all those years? Why did I look for love in a bottle? 

WEXLER

Mr. Kramer? You're up. 

MICKEY

Wait a minute. You are doing gonorrhea, aren't you? 

KRAMER

Well, we'll see. 

KRAMER

(pulling a liquor bottle from his jacket pocket) Well, I guess it started about twenty years ago when I got back from Viet Nam, and this was the only friend I had left. 

MICKEY

Hey! That's my cirrhosis! He's stealing my cirrhosis! (he jumps Kramer) You wanna be sick? I'll make you sick. 

CURTIS

Let me see if I understand this. You're concerned that he isn't concerned that you're going to hell. And you feel that she's too bossy. 

PUDDY

Yeah, that's right. 

CURTIS

Well, oftentimes in cases of inter-faith marriages, couples have difficulty-- 

CURTIS

You aren't? 

PUDDY

No. 

ELAINE

We're just, you know, having a good time. 

CURTIS

Oh, well then it's simple. You're both going to hell. 

PUDDY

No way, this is bogus, man! 

ELAINE

Well, thank you father. 

CURTIS

Oh, did you hear the one about the new guy in hell who's talkng to the devil by the coffee machine? 

PUDDY

I'm really not in the mood, I'm going to hell. 

ELAINE

Oh, lighten up. It'll only feel like an eternity. 

SOPHIE

You know, Jerry, there's this thing that I haven't told you about. See, there was this tractor and, oh boy, this is really difficult. 

JERRY

Sophie, it's me. I know about the tractor story and I'm fine with it. 

SOPHIE

How could you know? 

JERRY

(putting his finger to Sophie's lips, then to his own, then back to Sopie's) Shh. Shh. Shh. It's not important. What's important is I'm not gonna let a little thing like that ruin what could be a very long-term and meaningful relationship. 

KRAMER

...I didn't say that, no. 

MICKEY

You gave me gonorrhea, you didn't even tell me! 

KRAMER

Well, I'm sorry. I gave you gonorrhea because I thought you'd have fun with it. 

JERRY

Hey, hey! I'm with someone. 

KRAMER

Oh. Hello. 

SOPHIE

No, I understand. This could be a tough thing to deal with. The important thing is that you have a partner who's supportive. 

KRAMER

(to Mickey) You know? She's right. 

SOPHIE

Unfortunately, I didn't have a partner. I got gonorrhea from a tractor. 

JERRY

You got gonorrhea from a tractor?? And you call *that* your tractor story?? 

KRAMER

You can't get it from that. 

SOPHIE

But I did. My boyfriend said I got gonorrhea from riding the tractor in my bathing suit. 

JERRY

(walking out) Alright, that's it for me. You've been great. Goodnight everybody. 

GEORGE

Would you mind helping me out with some of this stuff?!? 

KRUGER

You seem like you've got a pretty good handle on it. 

GEORGE

No! I don't! Don't you even care? This is your company! It's your name on the outside of the building! Speaking of which, the 'R' fell off and all it says now is K-uger! 

KRUGER

K-uger, that sounds like one of those old-time car horns, huh? K-uger! K-uger! 

GEORGE

Huh-ho! Oh! You are too much, Mr. Kruger! Too much! 

KRUGER

(getting up to leave) Thank you George, you've been great. That's it for me. 

GEORGE

Oh no, you're not going out on a high note with me Mr. Kruger! 

KRUGER

It's K-uger! 

GEORGE

No! No! 

KRUGER

Goodnight everybody! 

GEORGE

I read somewhere that this Brentano's is the place to meet girls in New York. 

JERRY

First it was the health club, then the supermarket, now the bookstore. They could put it anywhere they want, no one's meetin' anybody. 

KRAMER

Jerry, look at all these pagodas, huh? I gotta get over to Hong Kong before it all goes back to China.. 

JERRY

(Sarcastic) You better hurry. 

GEORGE

I'm gonna hit the head. 

KRAMER

Oh, boy, look at this. Hong Kong's outlawed the rickshaw. See, I always thought those would be perfect for New York. 

JERRY

(Sarcastic) Yes. The city needs more slow-moving wicker vehicles. 

KRAMER

Hmm, Elaine's been to Hong Kong. I should give her a call. 

JERRY

She's at that annual Peterman party tonight. You know the one she danced at last year? 

KRAMER

(Remembering) No, that wasn't dancing. 

JERRY

(Pointing) Hey, there's Leo. 

KRAMER

Oh? Who's Leo? 

JERRY

Uncle Leo. 

KRAMER

Oh, yeah. Right. Uncle, Leo. Forgot his first name.. 

JERRY

Did I just see that?! 

KRAMER

(To Jerry) Well, that ougta keep you busy for a few days, huh? 

WALTER

(Joking around with her) So, Elaine.. are you going to dance this year? 

ELAINE

Maybe.. All over your face! 

WAITER

If you do dance, the cooks want to know - so they can be brought out of the kitchen. They missed it last year. 

PETERMAN

My friends, a toast. As the wolly-haired Melanasians of Papua, New Guinea once said, (Makes a series of clicking and popping sounds. The music starts up) All right! Who's dancing? (No one makes a gesture that they intend to dance) No one? Alright, I'll just have to get things started. (Grabs a female employee, and starts dancing with her. The crowd is impressed) 

ZACH

Hi, I'm Zach. 

ELAINE

Hi, I'm miserable. (They both laugh) 

MANAGER

Excuse me, Sir. What are you doing? 

GEORGE

(Acting innocent) I'm all set. 

MANAGER

(Pointing) Did you take that book with you into the bathroom? 

GEORGE

(Not sure what the answer should be) What do you want to hear? 

GEORGE

They made me buy it.. A hundred bucks this thing cost me. (Gesturing to the book) How dare they?! I got news for you, if it wasn't for the toilet, there would be no books. 

JERRY

(Sarcastic) Yeah. I understand Guttenberg used to spend a lot of time in there. 

GEORGE

They're selling coffee, bran muffins.. you're surrounded by reading material. It's entrapment! 

JERRY

(Reading the cover of the book George was forced to buy) 'French Impressionist Paintings'? 

GEORGE

I find the soothing pastorial images very conduc- 

JERRY

(Cutting him off) Thank you very much. 

GEORGE

Well, I'm gonna go back there later and return it when there's different people working.. You want to catch a movie? 

JERRY

I can't. I'm meeting Uncle Leo. I saw him shoplifting at the bookstore. 

GEORGE

(Praising Leo's stealing) Alright, Leo! Stickin' it to the man! 

JERRY

Sleeping in the caragain? 

ELAINE

Cocktail flu. 

JERRY

(Remembering) Oh, right. The big party.. 

GEORGE

You, uh, didn't dance again, did you? 

ELAINE

(Angered) No, I found a better way to humiliate myself. There was this guy, and we had a few too many.. 

GEORGE

You went home with him? 

ELAINE

Worse. We made out at the table like our plane was going down! 

JERRY

(Rubbing it in) Ah, the drunken make-out. An office classic. Did you end up xeroxing anything? 

ELAINE

(Gives Jerry a look) Do you know how embarrassing this is to someone in my position? 

JERRY

(Confused) What's your position? 

ELAINE

I am an associate. 

GEORGE

Hey, me too. 

WAITRESS

Yeah, me too. 

ELAINE

Oh God. Why did I do this? Now I'm the office skank. 

GEORGE

Well, unless you tell everybody you're dating. 

ELAINE

(Liking the idea) Ohh.. right. Cause if we're dating, what everyone saw was just a beautiful moment between two lovers. 

JERRY

(Jokingly rubbing it in) As opposed to a spirited bout of Skanko-Roman wrestling. 

ELAINE

(Sarcastic) Oh, bravo. 

JERRY

(Sarcastic) Oh, hey. Can I fix you fellas some drinks and sandwiches? 

KRAMER

(Taking his offer seriously) No, we've already eaten. 

NEWMAN

(Gesturing to dishes and silverware on the table) But you can clear some of this stuff out of the way. 

KRAMER

Jerry, check this out. (Pointing at some papers on the table) Remember my idea about rickshaws in New Youk? Well, we're gonna make it happen! 

JERRY

(Jokingly trying to be skeptical) No, you're not. 

KRAMER

Newman, he knows a guy in the Hong Kong post office.. 

JERRY

(Still skeptical) No, he doesn't. 

NEWMAN

He's shipping us a rickshaw. It can't miss! 

JERRY

Yes, it can. 

KRAMER

We'll start out with one, and they when it catches on, we're gonna have a whole fleet! 

NEWMAN

It's the romance of the Handsome Cab without the guilt or dander of the equine. 

JERRY

So, who's gonna pull this thing? 

KRAMER

(To Newman) Well, I just assumed you would. 

NEWMAN

Yeah, but I though- 

KRAMER

(Stopping his thought) Da-da-da-da no. 

JERRY

(Extremely happy about Kramer and Newman's dilemma) My, isn't this an awkward moment? 

KRAMER

(Brainstorming) What about the homeless? 

NEWMAN

Can't we worry about them later? 

KRAMER

(Explaining) To pull the rickshaw. 

NEWMAN

(Pondering Kramer's plan out loud) They do have an intimate knowledge of the street.. 

KRAMER

They're always walkin' around the city. Why not just strap something to them?! 

JERRY

(Sarcastic) Now, that's the first sensible idea I've heard all day. 

LEO

Jerry, hello! (Sits down) 

JERRY

So, Leo, how's everything? You doin' Okay? 

LEO

I still have the ringing in the ears. Sounds like the phone. 

JERRY

(Shrugging his problems off) Yeah, yeah. But what about money? Are you strapped? Do you need a little? 

LEO

What, are you kidding? I should you loaning you money! (Quickly amending what he just said) But I'm not. 

JERRY

(Being frank) Leo, I saw you in Brentano's yesterday. 

LEO

Why didn't ya say hello? 

JERRY

Because you were too busy stealing a book. 

LEO

(Giving a courtesy lesson) You still say hello. 

JERRY

(Showing that it's a problem) Leo, I saw you steal. 

LEO

Oh, they don't care. We all do it. 

JERRY

Who, criminals? 

LEO

Senior citizens. No big deal. 

JERRY

You could get arrested. 

LEO

Arrested? Come on! (Goes into a routine explaination for his stealing) I'm an old man. I'm confused! I thought I paid for it. What's my name? Will you take me home? 

JERRY

(Pleading) Leo.. 

LEO

Alright, alright. Mr. Goody Two-Shoes. You made your point. 

JERRY

(Thinking he's stopped Leo's thefts) Thank you. 

LEO

(Yelling out to every one in the coffee shop) Will somebody answer that damn phone?! 

ELAINE

(Talking to a co-worker) Of course Zach and I have been dating. What'd you think, I was the office skank? 

WALTER

Well.. 

ELAINE

'Well'? We've been dating for three months. Between you and me, and.. anyone else you want to tell. 

ELAINE

(Exits, closing the door behind her) Oh man. Ugh.. 

WALTER

(Pointing at the closed door) Isn't that Zach? 

ELAINE

Yeah. 

WALTER

Aren't you upset? 

ELAINE

(Starts to fake cry) Yes. Oh, man! Oh! 

KRAMER

Alright, listen up. Now, you three have been hand-picked out of possibly dozens that applied. Now, what we're looking for are motivated, hard-working, homeless gentlemen like yourselves to pull rickshaws. (One of the homeless men starts to wander off, walking away) Now, I don't caer where you're from, or how you got here, or what happened to your homes. But you will have to be physically fit. 

MAN

The government! 

KRAMER

(Continuing as if nothing happened) Because to pull rickshaws means more than just strong legs. You're also going to need a well-toned upper body. 

NEWMAN

Alright, who's first? 

KRMAER

Hey. 

NEWMAN

Name, please. 

MAN

Rusty. 

NEWMAN

(Writing on a clipboard) Rusty. 

KRAMER

(To Rusty) You know, I once knew a horse named Rusty. No offence. 

NEWMAN

(To Rusty) Alright, uh, take it down to the end of the block. Make a controlled turn, and bring her back. Let's see what you've got! Ok? Ready, and go! 

KRAMER

(Watching Rusty's pulling of the rickshaw) Giddy up! Good form. 

NEWMAN

(Yelling out to Rusty) Alright, pace yourself, 'Cause you're gonna have to do this all day for very little money. 

KRAMER

Hey, what's he doin'? 

NEWMAN

I think he stealing our rickshaw! 

KRAMER

Well, then, he's out! 

GEORGE

Yes, I, uh, I need to return this book. 

CASHIER

(Puts the book's code into the computer) I'm sorry, we can't take this book back. 

GEORGE

Why not? 

CASHIER

It's been flagged. 

GEORGE

(Confused) Flagged? 

CASHIER

It's been in the bathroom. 

GEORGE

It says that on the computer? 

CASHIER

Please take it home. We don't want it near the other books. 

GEORGE

(Outraged. Leaving) Well, you just lost a lot of business! Because I love to read! 

JERRY

(To himself) I don't believe this! (Walks over to a security guard) Excuse me, I wonder if you could do me a favor? My uncle's having a little problem with shoplifting.. 

GUARD

Mm-hmm. Where's your uncle? 

JERRY

(Pointing) He's over there in the overcoat. If you could just kind of put a scare into him.. You know, set him straight.. 

GAURD

(Into his walkie-talkie) We have a 51-50 in paperbacks. All units respond. 

JERRY

'51-50'? That - that's just a scare, right? 

GUARD

Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you to stand out of the way and let us handle this. (The Guard rushes tward Uncle Leo) Swarm! Swarm! 

LEO

What?! I'm an old man! I'm confused! 

GUARD

You're under arrest. 

JERRY

(To Guard) I just wanted you to scare him. 

LEO

Jerry, you ratted me out?! 

JERRY

(Unsure of what to say - he remember's Leo's courtesy tip) Hello? 

LEO

Hello. 

JERRY

Mom, I didn't rat out Uncle Leo. I just wanted the guard to scare him straight. 

HELEN

Jerry, he won't last a day in prison. 

JERRY

(Scoffing) Prison. I'm sure it's just a fine. 

MORTY

She's got priors. 

JERRY

(Not believeing it) Prior convictions? Leo? 

HELEN

It was a crime of passion. Leave it alone. 

MORTY

Besides, it's not stealing if it's something you need. 

JERRY

(Confused) What does that mean? 

HELEN

Nobody pays for everyting. 

JERRY

(Shocked at his parents) You're stealing too?! 

MORTY

Nothing. Batteries. (Jerry scoffs) Well, they wear out so quick. 

JERRY

Mom, you too? 

HELEN

Sometimes your father forgets, so I have to steal them. 

JERRY

Alright, I'll talk to you later. 

KRAMER

(While washing his hands in Jerry's kithen sink) Well, the rickshaw's gone. We strapped it to a homeless guy and he (Makes a noise), he bolted. 

JERRY

(Joking around) Well, you know, eighty-five percent of all homeless rickshaw businesses fail within the first three months. 

KRAMER

(To Newman) See, we should've gotten some collateral from him.. Like his bag of cans, or.. his other bag of cans. 

NEWMAN

We gotta find that rickshaw. You check the sewers and dumpsters. I'll hit the soup kitchens, bakeries, and smorgasbords. 

JERRY

To the Idiotmobile! 

JERRY

So, even though you're not really going out with this guy, he's cheating on you? 

ELAINE

That is correct. But here's the beauty part - now I stand up for myself by telling everybody I'm dumping his sorry ass, and I'm the office- 

JERRY

(Butting in) Tina Turner? 

ELAINE

(Accepting) Alright. 

GEORGE

Well, I've to every Brentano's. This thing's flagged in every database in town! 

JERRY

Is it so horrible to have to keep a book? 

GEORGE

I don't understand what the big deal is. They let you try on pants. 

JERRY

(Stern on George) Not underpants. 

ELAINE

Hey, that's your Uncle Leo. 

JERRY

(Getting up) Uncle Leo. Hello! 

LEO

(Bitter) Jerry. 

JERRY

(Trying to explain) Uncle Leo, I'm sorry. I didn't know about your.. past. 

LEO

(Exiting) You mean my crime of passion? If anyone betrays me, I never forget! 

JERRY

(Following Leo out the door) Uncle Leo, wait! Hello?! 

ELAINE

French impressionism. Oh, I love this. (Looking up at George) Now, what is the problem with this book? 

GEORGE

Nothing. 

ELAINE

How much do you want for it? 

GEORGE

You know, I could let it go for.. say.. a hundred and twenty-five. 

JERRY

Leo's furious. (He stops in his tracks when he sees Elaine looking at George's book) What is that doing on the table? 

GEORGE

(Wanting Elaine to take it off his hands, he tries to silence Jerry) Jerry, simmer down. 

JERRY

(Pointing) I'm not eating anything in the vicinity of that book. 

ELAINE

(Confused) What is wrong with this book? 

GEORGE

Simmer! 

JERRY

That book has been on a wild ride. George took it into the bathroom with him and- 

ELAINE

(Cutting Jerry off, she stands up, trying to get away from the book. Yelling out) Alright! Everyone clear! Bio-hazard coming through! Clear! Clear!! (Runs to the bathroom to wash her hands) 

GEORGE

(The damage has been done. He is slightly angered at Jerry) May I ask, what do you read in the bathroom? 

JERRY

I don't read in the bathroom. 

GEORGE

Well, aren't you something? 

PETERMAN

Elaine, do you have a moment? It's about your lover. 

ELAINE

(Faking a broken heart) Oh yes. I know all about his little performance in the break room. 

PETERMAN

Elaine, who among us hasn't snuck into the break room to nibble on a love newton? 

ELAINE

(Confused) Love newton? 

PETERMAN

I'm afraid the problem with Zach is more serious. He's back on the horse, Elaine. Smack. White palace. The Chinaman's nightcap. 

ELAINE

An addict? (Sacrcastic) Well, it just keeps getting better! 

PETERMAN

And, in a tiny way, I almost feel responsible. I'm the one who sent him to Thailand - in search of low-cost whistles. Filled his head with pseudoerotic tales of my own Opium excursions. Plus, I have him some phone numbers of places he could score near the hotel. 

ELAINE

Look, uh, Mr. Peterman, the fact is that I was planning on breaking up with Zach anyway. He was cheating on me! 

PETERMAN

Damn it, Elaine. That wasn't Zach. That was the yam-yam. Now, he is going cold turkey. (Ordering) And you will be at his side. 

ELAINE

Oh. Well, you know, I had planned to uh- 

PETERMAN

(Cutting her off) No buts, Elaine. Or I will strip you of your 'associate' status. (Goes to leave) Uh, P.S., the first twenty-four hours are the worst. Better bring a poncho. 

HELEN

It was a crime of passion. 

LEO

If anyone betrays me, I never forget. 

HELEN

He won't last a day in prison. 

LEO

(Leo has 'Jerry' written on the fingers his right hand, and 'Hello' written on his left. He's doing pull-ups) Jerry. Hello. Jerry. Hello. Jerry. (Turns to the right, yelling out) Answer that damn phone! 

JERRY

Hello? 

ELAINE

Hey, it's me. 

JERRY

Uncle Leo? 

ELAINE

(Sarcastic) Oh, that's nice. What are you up to? 

JERRY

Nightmares. You? 

ELAINE

My fake boyfriend is going through real withdrawals. 

ZACH

(Yelling out from off-camera) I'm burning up! Elaine! 

ELAINE

Eat your soup! 

JERRY

You're not feeding him, are you? 

ELAINE

Why? (Zach vomits. Elaine yells out to him) I told you, away from the curtains. Away. (Pointing) Use your bucket. (He vomits again - this time into the bucket) There you go, that's it. (To Jerry) You know what? I gotta go. 

KRAMER

Hey, buddy. 

JERRY

(Scared) Ah! Kramer! 

KRAMER

I thought I heard you. 

JERRY

Get out of here! 

NEWMAN

(From outside the room) Kramer? Kramer? (Enters Jerry's bedroom) There you are. 

JERRY

Will everybody please leave?! 

NEWMAN

I just heard that a postman spotted a rickshaw down in Battery Park. 

KRAMER

Our rickshaw? 

NEWMAN

It's entirely possible. 

JERRY

I want everyone out! 

KRAMER

(Exiting the bedroom with Newman) Let's talk in Jerry's kitchen. I'll make some cocoa. 

NEWMAN

(To Jerry) Good night. 

JERRY

(Bitter) Good night, Newman. 

NEWMAN

There it is! 

KRAMER

Rusty! 

RUSTY

Oh, there you are. Oh, do I get the job? 

KRAMER

(Sarcastic) Yeah, yeah. We'll get back to you. (Pulling the rickshaw with Newman) Let's get this baby home. 

NEWMAN

Uh.. 

KRAMER

What? 

NEWMAN

You know, when you think about it, it's kind of silly for us both to pull this thing all t he way back uptown. I mean, after all, it is a conveyance. 

KRAMER

Yes, that's true. 

NEWMAN

So, which one of us is gonna pull? 

KRAMER

Well, there's only one way to settle this. (Starts pointing back and forth between Newman and him with each word of the rhyme) One spot, two spot, zig, zag, tear, pop-die, pennygot, tennyum, tear, harum, scare 'em, rip 'em, tear 'em, tay, taw, toe.. 

NEWMAN

(Realizing he won) Yeah. 

KRAMER

Best two out of three? (Starts the pointing and the rhyme again) One spot, two spot.. 

NEMWAN

Hey, boy. Smooth it out up there. Too much jostling! 

REBECCA

(Gesturing tward the book) So, you want to donate this to charity? 

GEORGE

Well, I assume there's some sort of write-off. 

REBECCA

What's the value of the book? 

GEORGE

Uh, about two hundred dollars, Miss DeMooney. 

REBECCA

(Correcting. Stern) It's DeMornay. Rebecca DeMornay. 

GEORGE

Oh. 

REBECCA

(Opens the cover of the book) Oh, wait a second. (Certain) This book has been in the bathroom. 

GEORGE

(Nervous) Wh-what are you talking about? That - that's rediculous. 

REBECCA

It's been flagged. I know. I used to work in a Brentano's. Mister, we're trying to help the homeless heare - it's bad enough that we have some nut out there trying to strap 'em to a rickshaw! 

GEORGE

(Desperate to get rid of the book) Alright, I, I'll just take fifty. Do - do we have a deal? 

REBECCA

Yeah, and here it is: You get your toilet book out of here, and I won't jump over this counter and punch you in the brain! 

GEORGE

I could take it in merchandise.. 

REBECCA

(Threatening to hit him) Here I come.. 

ELAINE

So, this book'll tell me how to get puke out of cashmere? 

CASHIER

Yeah. 

ELAINE

Great. 

JERRY

(To Elaine) So, the worst is over? 

ELAINE

Yeah. Now I can break up with him. He's clean, and I'm the office hero. 

JERRY

Seems like you're better at fake relationships than real ones. 

ELAIEN

Yeah, huh. I even got an idea out of it. the Detox Poncho. 

ELAINE

(Leaving Jerry) See ya. 

JERRY

(To cashier) I'd like to speak with the manager, please. 

NEWMAN

Mind your pace, Boy. Chop, chop! 

KRAMER

(Tired) Oh, I can't go on. I gotta take a break. (Sets the rickshaw down - taking a rest) 

NEWMAN

Well, don't tarry. I'm behind schedule as it is. 

KRAMER

(Stretching) Oh.. 

NEWMAN

(Scared) Boy.. Boy. Kramer! 

KRAMER

Woah! Wait! 

NEWMAN

Ahhh! Yaaaahhh! 

ZACH

(Optimistic) Well, this is the first day of the rest of my life! 

NEWMAN

Waaaaahhhh! 

JERRY

George? What are you doin' here? 

GEORGE

I can't sell the book. It's been marked. 

JERRY

(Sarcasticly joking) It certainly has. 

GEORGE

So, I'm gonna steal another one, and then return it. That way, everything is even. 

JERRY

(Trying to straighten things out) You defile one book, steal another, ask for your money back - and to you that's even? 

GEORGE

I'm goin' in! 

MANAGER

Did you want to speak with the manager? 

JERRY

Yes. My Uncle Leo was cought shoplifing here the other day.. 

MANAGER

Yes, Uncle Leo. I remember him. I'm sorry, our policy is we prosecute all shoplifters. 

JERRY

(Pleading) Oh, come on. He's just a lonely old man. All old people steal. 

MANAGER

That's right. That's why we stopped carrying batteries. Look, I'll be honest with you, we've had a lot of trouble with theft lately - and my boss says I have to make an example to someone. 

JERRY

So it could be anyone? 

MANAGER

I.. guess. As long as we catch him in the act. 

JERRY

That guy! (Pointing at George) Swarm! Swarm! 

GEORGE

No! Jerry! 

ALL

Happy birthday to you. 

WALTER

Thanks. 

WORKER

Elaine, cake? 

ELAINE

Uh, no, thanks. 

WORKER

It's Walter's special day. 

ELAINE

You know, there are 200 people who work in this office. Every day is somebody's special day. 

WORKER

Elaine! Where're you going? It's Walter's last day. We have to celebrate. 

ELAINE

It's his birthday and it's his last day? 

WORKER

This is other-Walter, from returns. 

WALTER

Hey, what's going on here? 

ALL

Surprise! 

WALTER

Oh guys. 

WALTER

Elaine, it's my last day. Have a piece. 

ELAINE

All right, pile it on. 

ALL

For he's a jolly good fellow...happy birthday to you...for he's a jolly good fellow...birthday to you...which nobody can deny... 

JERRY

What is so bad about having a little piece of cake? 

ELAINE

It is the forced socializing. I mean, just because we work in the same office, why do we have to act like we're friends? 

JERRY

Why aren't you there now? 

ELAINE

I had to take a sick day. I'm so sick of these people. By the way, I talked to Lisi, and tomorrow night's good for her. 

JERRY

You know, I shouldn't go out with a friend of yours. I foresee messiness. 

ELAINE

Yeah, you're better off sitting around here, reading comic books, and eating spaghetti at two in the morning.. 

JERRY

Hey, speaking of tomato sauce, you want to come with me and George to Mario's Pizza? 

ELAINE

Your old high school hangout? Why? 

JERRY

They're closing. We're going for one last slice. 

KRAMER

Hey. All right. Hi. Check it out, official police caution tape. Look at that. 

KRAMER

Uh-uh-uh. Step back, son, there's nothing to see here. 

JERRY

Where did you get this? 

KRAMER

Well, I got it from my cop buddy Doug. 

JERRY

You sure have a lot of friends. How come I never see any of these people? 

KRAMER

They want to know why they never see you. 

KRAMER

I'm gonna eat that later. 

JERRY

So they just gave you this? 

KRAMER

Oh no, no,. no. I had to fish around in the evidence room for it. You know, they're all preoccupied, trying to hunt down this new psycho-serial killer, the Lopper. All right, I'll see ya. 

ELAINE

Wait a minute, wait a minute. Who is the Lopper? 

KRAMER

Oh, it's no big deal. It's just some guy who's been running around Riverside park-pffff. You know, cutting people's heads off. 

JERRY

How come I haven't read about this? 

KRAMER

Well, you know, the police, they've been having some internal dissension about the name. 

ELAINE

Really? What're the other titles? 

KRAMER

Uh, Headso...uh...The Denogginizer...Son of dad. 

JERRY

Son of dad? 

KRAMER

Yeah. That was my suggestion. It's sort of a catchall. 

GEORGE

Mario's Pizza. 

GEORGE

Just as she was. Hey, Mario! Remember us? 

MARIO

No. 

JERRY

We used to come in every day. 

MARIO

So where ya been? We're tanking here. 

GEORGE

We'll have 2 slices and 2 grape sodas. 

MARIO

Oh, thanks. That'll save us. 

JERRY

All right, make it the large sodas. 

GEORGE

Hey, Jerry, remember Frogger? I used to be so into this game. Gettin' that frog across the street was my entire life. 

JERRY

Yeah. And then you went on to...Well, it's a good game. 

GEORGE

Double jump! Eat the fly! Eat it! 

BOY

Thanks a lot. 

GEORGE

Ah, beat it, punk. 

JERRY

Hey, look at the high score--'G.L.C.' George Louis Costanza. That's not you, is it? 

GEORGE

Yes! 860,000. I can't believe it's still standing. No one has beaten me in like 10 years. 

JERRY

I remember that night. 

GEORGE

The perfect combination of Mountain Dew and mozzarella...just the right amount of grease on the joy stick... 

MARIO

Here's your pizza pea brains. 

JERRY

I think I remember why we stopped coming here. 

GEORGE

Yeah. 

ELAINE

This pen smells really bad. So why do I keep smelling it? Is it too late for me to go to law school? 

ELAINE

What is this? 

WORKER

You were out sick yesterday, so we got you a get-well cake. 

WORKER

It's carrot. It's good for you. 

WORKERS

Get well get well soon, we wish you to get-- 

ELAINE

Stop it! That's not even a song! I mean, now we're celebrating a sick day? 

WORKER

I think it's nice. 

ELAINE

What? What is nice? Trying to fill the void in your life with flour and sugar and egg and vanilla? I mean, we are all unhappy. Do we have to be fat, too? Not you Becky, I know you have a slow metabolism. I don't want one more piece of cake in my office! 

WORKER

Get well, get well soon-- 

WORKER

It's not happening. 

BECKY

Can we still it eat? 

JERRY

I'll tell you Lisi, I never expected that movie to-- 

LISI

End under water? 

JERRY

Be that long. I mean, most action movies are-- 

LISI

So much more violent. 

JERRY

Not as long. 

LISI

Well, I should probably-- 

JERRY

Get going. 

LISI

Yeah. 

JERRY

Well, it was nice meeting you. I'm sure I'll see you-- 

LISI

Eight tomorrow? 

JERRY

Actually, that's-- 

LISI

What you were thinking. 

JERRY

Right. 

GEORGE

Oh! Here you are. Ha ha...You, uh, you want to-- 

JERRY

Sure. (points at booth) How about this one? 

GEORGE

Well, I'm doing it, Jerry. I'm buying the Frogger machine. Now the torch will burn forever. 

JERRY

Fabulous. See, now you're really do something. 

GEORGE

So, you want to come down to Mario's Pizza with me and help me pick up the Frogger? 

JERRY

Hey, how you gonna keep the machine plugged in while you move it? 

GEORGE

What? 

JERRY

Once you unplug the machine, all the scores will be erased. 

GEORGE

You're right. Why must there always be a problem? You'd think just once I could get a break. God knows I earned it with that score! 

KRAMER

Well, more bad news Jerry. 

KRAMER

You know the police, they found another victim of the Lopper in Riverside Park. I saw the photo, and it looked a lot like you. 

JERRY

Oh, come on. There's a lot of people walking around the city that look like me. 

KRAMER

Not as many as there used to be. 

GEORGE

No. I need a guy that can rig a Frogger machine so that I can move it without losing power, 'cause I have the high score. H-hello? 

KRAMER

You know, George, you're not gonna find an electrician like that in the yellow pages. Now, I know just the guy who can do this. 

JERRY

Another friend? 

KRAMER

Oh, no, no, no. This guy is no friend. In fact, we don't even get along. 

GEORGE

Well, is he good, Kramer? 

KRAMER

Oh, he's the best...and the worst. 

GEORGE

Kramer, listen to me. I'm never gonna have a child. If I lose this Frogger high score, that's it for me. 

KRAMER

Believe me George, you can count on Slippery Pete. 

GEORGE

Slippery Pete? 

KRAMER

Yeah, I don't care for the name, either. In fact, that's one of the things that we argue about. 

GEORGE

All right, I'm gonna find a guy with a truck. GLC must live on! 

JERRY

Come on. 

KRAMER

Dng-ga-gng-ga-wt. 

JERRY

Hello? 

ELAINE

So how's it going with my friend? 

JERRY

She's a sentence finisher. It's like dating Mad Libs. 

JERRY

What is that? 

ELAINE

Oh, it's a cake party. It's the third one today. I didn't realize how hooked I got on that 4:00 sugar rush. 

JERRY

So join in. 

ELAINE

I can't. I denounced them. Maybe I'll go raid Peterman's fridge. He's always got a truffle or something in there. 

JERRY

All right. 

JERRY

Hey, wh-what-- 

KRAMER

Yeah. I dropped an egg. Be careful. 

ELAINE

Anybody here? Peterboy? 

ELAINE

Ooh, it's a cake walk. 

PETERMAN

Get well, get well soon we wish you to get well. 

PETERMAN

Ha ha ha ha...Oh, what a stirring little anthem of wellness. 

ELAINE

Mr. Peterman, um-- 

PETERMAN

We missed you at the get well party. Poor old Walt has a polyp in the duodenum. It's benign, but--ooh--still a bastard. Oh, Elaine, can you keep a secret? 

ELAINE

No, sir, I can't. 

PETERMAN

Inside that small college boy minifridge is my latest acquisition. A slice of cake from the wedding of King Edward VIII to Wallis Simpson, circa 1937, price--$29,000. 

JERRY

Well Lisi, that was another- 

LISI

Lovely evening. 

JERRY

Really bad meal. I was thinking maybe we should-- 

LISI

Go for a hansom cab ride? 

JERRY

Call it a night. I'll walk you home. Where do you live? 

LISI

84th street, right off Riverside Park. 

JERRY

Riverside Park. 

LISI

I thought we were going-- 

JERRY

Back to my place. That's right. 

GEORGE

So you slept with her? 

JERRY

She lives right off Riverside Park. I was scared of the Lopper, So I let her stay over. 

GEORGE

And you automatically sleep with her? 

JERRY

Well, I just wanted to make out a little, but she kind of-- 

GEORGE

Finished your thought. 

ELAINE

Guess what I ate. 

GEORGE

An ostrich burger. 

ELAINE

No. A $29,000 piece of cake. Peterman got it at The Duke Of Windsor auction. It was the most romantic thing I've ever eaten. 

JERRY

How'd it taste? 

ELAINE

A little stale. 

JERRY

Yeah. 

GEORGE

So, uh are you sleeping with Peterman? 

ELAINE

No. He doesn't know I ate it. In fact, he almost caught me. I have to sneak back in and even it out. 

GEORGE

You know, they say ostrich has less fat, but you eat more of it. 

ELAINE

Hey, so I talked to Lisi and she has got a big surprise for you. She's planning a weekend trip to Pennsylvania Dutch country. 

JERRY

Pennsylvania Dutch country? Oh, that's the serious relationship weekend place. 

ELAINE

What is going on with you two? 

JERRY

Well, I think by sleeping with her, I may have sent her the wrong message. 

GEORGE

What's that? 

ELAINE

4:00 sugar fix. 

JERRY

Well, I'm calling this off right now. 

ELAINE

No, no. You are way past the phone call breakup stage. 

JERRY

Well, I'm not going over there. That's where the Lopper is. 

ELAINE

Oh...it's daylight. It won't take you that long. Just make a clean break. 

ELAINE

Just a little off the side... 

ELAINE

Well, no point in wasting $1,200. 

ELAINE

Oh, commander, isn't the wedding marvelous? More cake? Oh, I shouldn't. I mustn't. Ah, what the hell? 

GEORGE

Now, each of you is here because you're the best at what you do. 

GEORGE

Slippery Pete, Kramer tells me you are one hell of a rogue electrician. And shlomo, you're the best truck driver. 

SHLOMO

I don't know If I'm the best. 

GEORGE

Oh...you're very good. 

SHLOMO

Let's say 'good.' 

GEORGE

Ok. Good. And Kramer, you're in charge of taping off the loading zone. 

KRAMER

Lock and load. 

PETE

You think you can handle that, numb nuts? 

KRAMER

All right, all right, come on, now. 

PETE

That was my mail-order bride. 

KRAMER

Hey, you weren't home, so I signed for her. 

PETE

It doesn't give you the right to make out with her. 

KRAMER

You weren't even married yet. 

GEORGE

All right, all right, calm down, calm down. Whatever happened in the past is past. 

GEORGE

Now, this is the basic layout for Mario's Pizza. 

SHLOMO

So what kind of jail time are we looking at if we're caught? 

GEORGE

What do you mean? 

PETE

We're stealing this thing, right? 

GEORGE

No. I--I paid for it. 

PETE

I thought we were stealing it. 

KRAMER

Yeah. It feels like we're stealing it. 

GEORGE

We're not stealing it. 

SHLOMO

I definitely thought we're stealing it. 

GEORGE

All right, let's--let's focus. Can we get back to the plan? 

PETE

Well, I need a battery for this kind of a job. Can I at least steal a battery? 

GEORGE

Fine. Steal the battery. Now, all right, here is the Frogger. This is the front door, and this is the outlet. 

PETE

What's that? 

GEORGE

The outlet? 

PETE

Mm-hmm. 

GEORGE

That's where the electricity comes out. 

PETE

Oh, you mean the holes. 

SHLOMO

Which one's the bathroom? 

GEORGE

Uh, here. 

SHLOMO

They put the Frogger with the toilet? Yecchh. 

GEORGE

The Frogger is here. 

KRAMER

George, I thought that was the door. 

PETE

Where are all the pizza ovens? 

SHLOMO

I thought the bathroom was here. 

GEORGE

All right. You understand now? It's not that complicated. 

ELAINE

I need to replace an antique piece of cake. 

ELAINE

Do you have anything that's been...you know, laying around for a while? Something prewar would be just great. 

KRAMER

Oh, hey, Elaine. What, you got the munchies? 

ELAINE

Oh, Kramer, I am in big. big, big trouble. I need a cake that looks like this. 

KRAMER

Oh, yeah--Sotheby's. Yeah. They make good cake. 

ELAINE

Do any of these look close? 

KRAMER

No, but I know I've seen cake just like that. Oh--Entenmann's. Yeah. 

ELAINE

Entenmann's? From the supermarket? 

KRAMER

Well, no. They're not really in the supermarket. Yeah, they got their own case at the end of the aisle. 

JERRY

Hi, Lisi. 

LISI

Hi, honey. Is that a bat? 

JERRY

Uh, yeah. I found it on the street. It's gotta be worth something. 

LISI

So, what do you want to do, Sweetheart? 

JERRY

Well, before we do anything...maybe we should talk. 

JERRY

Then this Pennsylvania Dutch thing comes out of nowhere. I mean, how am I supposed to respond to that? 

LISI

Then may I say something... without being interrupted? 

JERRY

Well I'm sorry if I ruined your life. That's exactly what I set out to do. 

LISI

Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh... 

LISI

Are you afraid to kiss me in public? 

JERRY

Have we even been in public? 

LISI

So now you're going to tell me what I'm thinking. Well, go ahead, 'cause I'd really like to know. 

JERRY

You are not dumb. Don't say that.. 

JERRY

These beans are pretty good. 

LISI

20 minutes. 

JERRY

Well, I'm sorry I'm not Brad. I'm me! 

JERRY

Nice to meet ya! 

LISI

Boy, did your mother do a number on you. 

LISI

Fine. So it's over. 

JERRY

Oh, thank god. Why is it dark out? What time is it? 

LISI

9:30. 

JERRY

We've been breaking up for 10 hours? 

LISI

Good-bye, Jerry. 

JERRY

Lopper. You know, Lisi, maybe we should give this a little more time. See how it looks in the light of day. 

LISI

Out! 

JERRY

Lopper. 

JERRY

Lisi, Lisi. Let me in! We can work this out. I was wrong, you were right. I'll do anything! 

GEORGE

Jerry, you came for the big moment. 

JERRY

No. I'm waiting for... 

GEORGE

Ha ha. Everything's timed out to perfection, Jerry. Slippery Pete's got the Frogger running on battery power, the truck will be there any minute, and Kramer's taped out the loading zone. 

JERRY

Oh. Sounds great. 

GEORGE

Yeah, yeah. You gotta come over tonight. We can play. 

JERRY

Oh, I can't. I'm busy. I'm going away on a long weekend. 

GEORGE

Where? 

LISI

Look what I found. I got one for you, too. 

JERRY

Great. Uh, you know what? Why don't you put it in the car so I don't toss it in that dumpster? 

LISI

Ha ha. Ok. I'll meet thee in front of your place, 15 minutes. 

JERRY

A long, long weekend. 

GEORGE

I hear thee. 

PETERMAN

Elaine! Excellent. I'd like you to meet a friend of mine, Irwin Lubeck. 

ELAINE

Oh, hello. 

LUBECK

Charmed. 

PETERMAN

All right, brace yourself, Lubeck. You are about to be launched via pastry back to the wedding of one of the most dashing and romantic Nazi sympathizers of the entire British Royal family. 

ELAINE

I guess I'll just-- 

PETERMAN

Oh, no Elaine, stay. Lubeck here is the world's foremost appraiser of vintage pastry. 

PETERMAN

All right, Lubeck. How much is she worth? 

LUBECK

I'd say about 219. 

PETERMAN

Ha ha ha ha ha!$219,000! Lubeck, you glorious titwillow. You just made me a profit of $190,000. 

LUBECK

No, $2.19. It's an Entenmann's. 

PETERMAN

Do they have a castle at Windsor? 

LUBECK

No. They have a display case at the end of the aisle. 

PETERMAN

Oh, good lord. 

LUBECK

You all right, Peterman? You look ill. 

ELAINE

Get well, get well soon, we want you to get well. Get well, get well soon we want you to get well. 

GEORGE

What are you guys doing? 

SHLOMO

Eat the fly. Eat the fly. Got him! 

GEORGE

You idiots. You're gonna wear down the battery. 

PETE

The batteries are fine. We've got...oh, god. only 3 minutes left. 

GEORGE

Quick. Get this thing back in the pizzeria 

KRAMER

George, they closed up. 

GEORGE

I need an outlet! 

PETE

A what? 

GEORGE

Holes! I need holes! 

KRAMER

The pharmacy's still open. 

GEORGE

All right. Kramer, you block off traffic. You to go sweet-talk the pharmacist. 

PETE

You owe me a quarter. 

GEORGE

Slippery Pete. Kramer, hurry up! 

KRAMER

Ahh! I'm out! No tape left! 

JERRY

Well, come on George, I'll help you push it across. 

GEORGE

Wait a minute. This looks familiar. This reminds me of something. I can do this. 

JERRY

By yourself? 

GEORGE

Jerry, I've been preparing for this moment my entire life. 

SHLOMO

He looks like a Frog. 

PETE

So do you. 

JERRY

Game over. 

ELAINE

Mr. Peterman, you wanted to see me, sir? 

PETERMAN

Elaine, up until a moment ago, I was convinced that I was on the receiving end of one of the oldest baker's grift in the books--The Entenmann's shim-sham. 

ELAINE

Ohh... 

PETERMAN

Until I remembered the videotape surveillance system that I installed to catch other-Walter using my latrine. But it also caught this. 

EALINE

Mr. Peterman, I, uh... 

PETERMAN

Elaine, I have a question for you. Is the item still...with you? 

ELAINE

Um...as far as I know. 

PETERMAN

Do you know what happens to a butter-based frosting after six decades in a poorly ventilated English basement? 

ELAINE

Uh, I guess I hadn't-- 

PETERMAN

Well, I have a feeling that what you are about to go through is punishment enough. Dismissed. 

JERRY

Cup of tea with lemon. 

GEORGE

What happened to your voice? 

JERRY

I was screamin' at hecklers all night. The last time I open for a rodeo. 

GEORGE

Well, Jerry, I been thinkin'. I've gotten as far as I can go with George Costanza. 

JERRY

Is this the suicide talk or the nickname talk? 

GEORGE

The nickname. George. What is that? It's nothing. It's got no snap, no zip. I need a nickname that makes people light up. 

JERRY

You mean like...Liza! 

GEORGE

But I was thinking...T-bone. 

JERRY

But there's no 't' in your name. What about G-bone? 

GEORGE

There's no G-bone. 

JERRY

There's a g-spot. 

GEORGE

That's a myth. 

JERRY

T-bone, the ladies are gonna love ya. 

ELAINE

Why did they hire you for a rodeo? 

JERRY

They heard I opened for Kenny Rogers once. 

ELAINE

Didn't he throw you off a bus in the middle of Alabama or-- 

JERRY

Oh, I had that comin' to me. 

ELAINE

You know, Kenny Rogers has a- 

ELAINE

Why did you get a maid? 

JERRY

You don't have to whisper. She knows she's a maid. 

ELAINE

Where did you get her? 

JERRY

I hired her from a service! 

MAID

All done. 

JERRY

Thank you. Nice job. 

MAID

Is this mine? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

JERRY

What? 

ELAINE

Come on, Jerry. You didn't notice? 

JERRY

Notice what? She's not really even a maid. 

ELAINE

Oh. 

JERRY

She wants to be an actress...or a, uh, model...or a dancer...or a...news woman. 

ELAINE

Uh-huh. News woman. Yeah. 

KRAMER

Hey. Well, bad news, boys. My life is over. My girlfriend's movin' away. 

JERRY

You have a girlfriend? 

KRAMER

Jerry, where have you been? 

JERRY

At a rodeo. Where's she moving? 

KRAMER

Downtown. 

ELAINE

Downtown New York? 

KRAMER

Yeah. I don't know if I can handle one of these long-distance relationships. 

JERRY

It's like 10 minutes by subway. 

KRAMER

I don't know. 

KRAMER

Oh! Jeez! Well, you've got a maid. It's a whole different world downtown-- different Gap, different Tower Records, and she's a 646. 

ELAINE

What? What is that? 

JERRY

That's the new area code. They've run out of 242s, so all the new numbers are 646. 

ELAINE

I was a 718 when I first moved here. I cried every night. 

KRAMER

Listen. Heads up, Elaine. I'm gonna have to stop by later and pick up a fax. 

ELAINE

At work? 

KRAMER

No. At your apartment. 

ELAINE

I don't have a fax machine. 

JERRY

Here we go. 

KRAMER

Well, now what are we gonna do? (to Jerry) See? This is why you should get a fax and a Xerox. 

JERRY

And a dead bolt. 

ELAINE

Then maybe you have a fax machine. 

KRAMER

You just blew my mind. 

KRUGER

Let's order lunch. 

KRUGER

Mary, I will have a chef's salad. 

WORKER

Turkey sandwich. 

GEORGE

T-bone steak. 

KRUGER

For lunch? 

GEORGE

Well, I am just a T-bone kinda guy. Love that T-bone. In fact, you might as well call me-- 

WATKINS

That sounds good. I'll have one, too. 

KRUGER

Watkins, you're havin' a T-bone? 

WATKINS

I love 'em. 

KRUGER

Well, then we should call you T-bone. 

GEORGE

Uh, no. No, we shouldn't. 

KRUGER

T-bone! 

ALL

T-bone! T-bone! T-bone! T-bone! T-bone! T-bone! T-bone! T-bone! 

ELAINE

Hello? 

ELAINE

What? 

MACHINE

You have 57 messages. Message one... 

MACHINE

Message two... 

MACHINE

Message three... 

GEORGE

Hey, it's George. Listen, I- 

MACHINE

Message four... 

EALINE

Hello? 

ELAINE

Aah! 

JERRY

Well Cindy, the place looks great. 

CINDY

Thanks Jerry, gotta run. 

JERRY

Ok, I'll see ya. 

CINDY

Hi, Elaine. 

ELAINE

All right! You're foolin' around with your maid. That is a wise decision. 

JERRY

Elaine, do you think I would go willy-nilly into a situation so obviously fraught with potential complications? 

ELAINE

You are paying a woman to come to your house and sleep with you. 

JERRY

No. I pay her to clean. The rest is-- 

ELAINE

What? A health plan? 

JERRY

I was going to say, 'Being a good host.' 

ELAINE

Oh-ho-ho. Oh. 

JERRY

But the point is we have our personal relationship, and we have our work relationship. They're separate and, I think, some what sophisticated. 

ELAINE

So you consider this a relationship? 

JERRY

Yes, I do. 

ELAINE

Oh. Have you been out? 

JERRY

Yes, we have. 

ELAINE

Where did you go? 

JERRY

The store. 

ELAINE

Mm! To get what? 

JERRY

Stuff. 

ELAINE

Cleaning supplies? 

JERRY

And gum. 

ELAINE

Oh. Well, there's nothin' more sophisticated than diddlin' the maid and then chewin' some gum. 

JERRY

She's not a maid. She might be a news woman! 

KRAMER

Hey. Well, I just saw Madeline off. Yeah. She's in a cab and--nguh nguh nguh--on her way. I miss her already. 

ELAINE

Hey, Kramer, what was it you were having faxed to my house every 30 seconds? 

KRAMER

Well, I signed up for a food delivery service, Now We're Cookin'. That's a play on words. You know, they're faxing me the menus from some restaurants. 

ELAINE

Which ones? 

KRAMER

Well, all of them. It's the deluxe package. 

ELAINE

So this is never gonna stop? 

KRAMER

Well, it better not. Paid for the whole year. So, should I pick those up later? 

ELAINE

You can pick 'em up right now. 

KRAMER

Ah! 

ELAINE

I wonder if anyone knows he's here. If he just disappeared...would anybody notice? 

MAN

All right, miss Benes, all finished. Here's your new number. 

ELAINE

Ahem. 646? What is this? 

MAN

That's your new area code. 

ELAINE

I thought 646 was just for new numbers. 

MAN

This is a new number. 

ELAINE

No, no, no, no. It's not a new number. It's--it's--it's just a changed number. See? It's not different. It's the same, just...changed. 

MAN

Look, I work for the phone company. I've had a lot of experience with semantics, so don't try to lure me into some maze of circular logic. 

ELAINE

You know, I could've killed you, and no one would've known. 

MAN

I could've killed you, and no one would've known. 

JERRY

Kramer, you're still on the phone? 

KRAMER

Madeline and I are watching Quincy together. Jerry, you know this comes on at the same time here as it does there? 

JERRY

Really? It's Tuesday here. What day is it there? 

KRAMER

Jerry's teasing. Uh-oh! Commercial. Oh, you going to the bathroom? Yeah. I'll go, too. 

JERRY

Madeline stays here. 

JERRY

Hey, T-bone! 

GEORGE

No. No T-bone. 

JERRY

No T-bone? 

KRAMER

Hey, is that T-bone?! 

JERRY

No! There's no T-bone! 

KRAMER

Well, why no T-bone?! 

JERRY

Why no T-bone? 

GEORGE

'Cause Neil Watkins from accounting is T-bone! 

KRAMER

Oh, yeah I'm back. Hey, you wanna play cards over the phone? 

KRAMER

Oh, hey, uh, listen, Jerry, uh, laundry's pilin' up there. You might want to tell your girlfriend. Mmm. Yeah. 

GEORGE

Your girlfriend is doin' your laundry? 

KRAMER

He's sleeping with his maid! 

GEORGE

You're sleepin' with the maid? 

JERRY

Yes. 

GEORGE

I've done that. Did you ever eat an ostrich burger? 

JERRY

No. 

MAN

You're probably one of those women who doesn't like to give out her number. 

ELAINE

No, I'm not. Here you go. 

MAN

646? 

ELAINE

It's a new area code. 

MAN

What area? New Jersey? 

ELAINE

No, no. It's right here in the city. It's the same as 212. They just multiplied it by 3, and then they added one to the middle number. It's the same. 

MAN

Do I have to dial a one first? 

MAN

I'm really kinda seein' somebody. 

ELAINE

Yeah? Well, so am I! 

GEORGE

Excuse me. Can I talk to you for a second there, Watkins? 

WATKINS

It's T-bone. 

GEORGE

The thing is...I'm supposed to be T-bone. 

WATKINS

Heh heh. You're not a T-bone. You're a perfect George. 

GEORGE

What? Now, you listen to me! 

KRUGER

Hey, look at George. He's givin' it to T-bone. He's jumpin' up and down like some kind of monkey. Hey, what was the name of that monkey that could read sign language? 

WATKINS

All right, you can have T-bone. Stop crying. 

GEORGE

I'm not crying. And I shouldn't have said that about your wife. Please accept my apologies. 

GEORGE

Ok, everybody, uh...I have an announcement to make. From now on, I will be known as- 

KRUGER

Koko the monkey. 

GEORGE

What? 

ALL

Koko! Koko! Koko! Koko! Koko! Koko! Koko! Koko! Koko! Koko! 

MAN

Thank you both for being here. 

EALINE

Um, excuse me. I live in the building. Did something happen to Mrs. Krantz? 

MAN

She passed. 

ELAINE

Oh, I'm so sorry. 

MAN

Thank you. 

ELAINE

A quick question-- did she by any chance have a 212 phone number? 

CINDY

I can't find my earring. Oh, here it is. 

KRAMER

Hey, listen, can I borrow your suitcases? 

JERRY

Yeah. It's in your closet. 

KRAMER

No, no, no. I looked. 

JERRY

They're behind my skis and my tennis racket. 

KRAMER

Thanks, buddy. 

JERRY

Where you goin'? 

KRAMER

Huh? Well, I'm gettin' out of town. I'm gonna visit Madeline for the weekend. You know, this place is lookin' kinda messy. What happened to Cindy? 

JERRY

Well, she's here. She just didn't get around to it. 

KRAMER

Oh. 

CINDY

Hi, Kramer. 

CINDY

Thanks, Jerry. Bye. 

KRAMER

Well, what's the matter? 

JERRY

What did I just pay for? 

KRAMER

Uh-oh. You're a john. 

JERRY

Koko? 

GEORGE

Koko. 

JERRY

Well, it's probably the most intelligent ape there is. 

GEORGE

Yeah. So, how's Cindy the maid? 

JERRY

Well, everything's goin' great except, basically, I'm payin' for sex. 

GEORGE

Tell me about it. I went out with this girl last week. First I had to pay for dinner, then-- 

JERRY

No, George. She's coming over and not cleaning. It's like I'm seein' a prostitute. 

GEORGE

How much you pay this maid? 

JERRY

40. 

GEORGE

40? I'm payin' 60 to my maid. She doesn't do laundry and I'm gettin' nothin'. All right. Once she pinched my ass, but I don't know what that was. 

JERRY

I don't know what this is. 

KRAMER

Hey, hey, hey. Look at that. 

JERRY

Ooh. 

KRAMER

Jerry, you wouldn't believe what it's like down there. Taxicab drivers are insane. You know, everybody is in a hurry. 

GEORGE

I can't eat with you leanin' over like this. Just look straight forward. 

KRAMER

Well, now I can't see Jerry. 

JERRY

I look about the same. 

GEORGE

What? 

JERRY

I was talking to him. 

KRAMER

What? 

JERRY

Never mind. 

KRAMER

Come on. What'd he say? 

GEORGE

Never mind. 

KRAMER

Jerry, come on. What'd you say? 

JERRY

What? 

KRAMER

Come on. Where'd you go? 

JERRY

Go back. 

KRAMER

Eh! Come on. What did you say? 

JERRY

I said, never mind. 

KRAMER

Yeah. I know that. Uh, uh. 

JERRY

I hate the counter. 

ELAINE

Hey. 

JERRY

Hey. 

ELAINE

I hate the counter. 

KRAMER

Who's that? 

ELAINE

Well, I got a 212 number from this little old lady in my building-- Mrs. Krantz. 

JERRY

Oh, she didn't mind? 

ELAINE

No. She died. 

JERRY

Hey, that's great. 

GEORGE

What happened to Mrs. Krantz? 

JERRY

Elaine got a new number because she died. 

KRAMER

Newman died? 

ELAINE

What did he say? 

JERRY

Some new kind of pie. 

GEORGE

I'll try a piece. 

KRAMER

All right, who's down there? 

JERRY

Hey, there's a booth. 

KRAMER

Hey, Elaine. 

ELAINE

Oh, hi. 

KRAMER

Did you hear about Newman? 

ELAINE

What? 

GEORGE

Hey. 

JERRY

So how's it goin' at work? They get tired of it? 

GEORGE

Oh, yeah. 

JERRY

Double zero? 

GEORGE

It's 'ooh' As in 'ooh ooh ah ah.' 

CINDY

Your nickname's Koko? One of the girls down at the maid service is named Coco. 

GEORGE

Really? Coco? 

CINDY

Yeah. Coco. That girl's all right. 

GEORGE

You know, if I could get this Coco woman down to Kruger, they wouldn't be able to call me Koko anymore because Kruger would never allow 2 Kokos. 

JERRY

Sounds like he runs a real tight ship. 

GEORGE

Say good-bye to Koko. 

JERRY

Good-bye, Koko. 

KRAMER

Bye, Koko. Whew! Jerry, this relationship is killing me. The distance, the longing, the distance, the-- you know, I didn't realize it, but I'm a needy person. 

JERRY

Kramer, maybe this relationship isn't for you. 

KRAMER

Oh, yeah? So what am I supposed to do, be more like you? All sealed up in here, emotionally unavailable, paying scrubwomen for sexual favors! No! Jerry, I won't be like you! Never! I'll never be like you! 

CINDY

What was that? 

JERRY

I didn't hear anything. 

CINDY

All right, I'm takin' off. Aren't you forgetting something? 

JERRY

Oh, right! Hey, it was great seeing you again. I love your outfit. 

CINDY

No. My money. 

JERRY

For what? 

CINDY

For my maid services. You booked me for today. 

JERRY

But you didn't really do any work. 

CINDY

I made the bed. 

JERRY

But you took a nap in it. 

CINDY

So? 

JERRY

I thought that was kind of girlfriend bed making. 

CINDY

No. That was the maid. 

JERRY

Well, who took the nap? 

CINDY

The girlfriend. 

JERRY

$40 seems kind of steep for a nap. 

CINDY

So, what are you saying? That I'm a bad maid or some kind of a prostitute? 

JERRY

Ho, ho...ho! Hold on. Let's keep this sophisticated. 

CINDY

You know, I don't think I want to be your girlfriend or your maid. 

JERRY

So is this a breakup/quitting? 

CINDY

Yeah. Don't ever call me or hire me again. 

JERRY

Oh, yeah? Well, then, we're through! And you're fired! 

MAN

Sign here. 

ELAINE

Yes! 212. 

ELAINE

Hey, what happened to the guy I had last time? 

MAN

Oh, you know, it's an odd thing. He went out on a job and never came back. Nobody knows what happened. 

ELAINE

All right! I am back in the game. 

ELAINE

Hello? 

BOY

Gammy! 

ELAINE

No. You got the wrong number, kid. 

BOY

Gammy Krantz, it's your grandson Bobby. Why haven't you called? 

ELAINE

Oh...nuts. 

BOY

Do you hate me 'cause of my lazy eye? 

ELAINE

No. It's just that I've been kind of buried over here. 

JERRY

So the kid doesn't know his grandmother is dead? G-5? 

ELAINE

Hit. No. I guess his parents didn't want to tell him. B-2? 

JERRY

Miss. 

ELAINE

He called 6 times yesterday. What a nightmare it must be to have a real family. 

JERRY

I wouldn't worry about it. B-6? 

ELAINE

Hit. Uhh...you sank my submarine. 

JERRY

Elaine... 

JERRY

Hello? 

VOICE

You have a collect call from-- 

KRAMER

Hey, buddy, don't say no! 

JERRY

I accept. 

KRAMER

I went down to Madeline's. I told her, 'You gotta move, or it's over.' 

JERRY

Well, what happened? 

KRAMER

I think it's over. We had a big fight, she threw me out, I started walkin', and now I'm lost downtown! I don't have any money. I don't recognize anybody. I miss home, and I don't even know how to get there. 

JERRY

What's around you? 

KRAMER

I'm lookin' at Ray's Pizza. You know where that is? 

JERRY

Is it Famous Ray's? 

KRAMER

No. It's Original Ray's. 

JERRY

Famous Original Ray's? 

KRAMER

It's just Original, Jerry! 

JERRY

Well, what street are you on? 

KRAMER

Hey, I'm on first and first. How can the same street intersect with itself? I must be at the nexus of the universe. 

JERRY

Just wait there. I'll pick you up, and, Kramer, stay alive no matter what occurs, I will find you! 

KRAMER

Aah! 

MAN

You Steinfeld? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

MAN

My name is Maxwell. I'm from Maid To Order. It's a pun. I sent one of my girls over to your place. 

JERRY

Cindy. 

MAN

She says she had a little problem with you. You didn't pay. 

JERRY

You know, she didn't really do what she was supposed to do. 

MAN

Oh, yeah? She told me what you like. You're a little sickie, aren't you? Disinfectant on the blinds, vacuuming the counter-- 

JERRY

Hey, come on. Come on. I gotta live around here. 

MAN

You know what I do to people who stiff me on a job? 

JERRY

What? 

MAN

Well, it kinda depends on the situation, but if I don't get my money from you, I'm gonna get it from her. 

JERRY

I don't want to make trouble. You want the money? Here. 

MAN

Hey! Wait, wait, wait! Whoa! Give it to the girl. I'm an independent contractor. Tax purposes. 

ELAINE

Bobby, you gotta stop calling your Gammy. Why? Because sometimes you call very early in the morning when Gammy has been out late the night before and sometimes when Gammy's not alone. Your parents still haven't said anything to you about your Gammy? (sighs) All right, here we go. (coughing) Gammy doesn't feel so good. I think Gammy might be dying. Yep. Yep. Ok. Good-bye, Bobby. Don't call anymore. I'm dead now. Gotta go. 

BOBBY

9-1-1. 

JERRY

Nexus of the universe. Hey, Cindy. Cindy. 

CINDY

What do you want? 

JERRY

Here. I got your money. 

CINDY

I don't want any money from you. 

JERRY

Come on. Take it. It's money. Let me give it to ya. 

POLICE

Looking for a good time, sir? You wanna step out of the car, sickie? 

JERRY

Well, this is all very sophisticated. 

FIREMAN

All right, hang on, Gammy! You're gonna make it! 

ELAINE

Aah! 

MAXWELL

Hey, you look a little lost. You from around here? 

KRAMER

Uh, no. 

MAXWELL

You know where you're going? 

KRAMER

Not really. My friend was supposed to pick me up, but I don't know where he is. 

MAXWELL

Doesn't sound like much of a friend. You got any money? 

KRAMER

Uh, no. 

MAXWELL

You wanna make some? 

KRAMER

Ok. 

MAXWELL

Do you know how to use a mop wringer? 

KRAMER

Yeah, yeah. 

MAXWELL

Why don't you get in the car? 

KRAMER

Hi. Ahh...these are soft seats. 

KRUGER

Hey, Koko, Who's this? 

GEORGE

This is our new Vice-president of Acquisitions, sir. 

KRUGER

So you're just hiring new people now? That's your job, to hire people? 

GEORGE

Yes? 

KRUGER

Ok, good enough for me, Koko. 

KRUGER

Ahem. Now, what's your name? 

COCO

My name is Coco. Coco Higgins. 

GEORGE

Coco? 

KRUGER

We can't have 2 Cocos. So I guess you're back to being George. 

GEORGE

Well, it was a hell of a ride. 

KRUGER

All right, the Grace building. There's a big stain on the front. How do we get it off? 

COCO

When I was a little girl in Jamaica, my Gammy taught me to take a wet rag and in a circ-- 

GEORGE

Ah, excuse me, Vice-president Coco, no one cares about your Gammy. 

COCO

What did you say about my Gammy? 

GEORGE

Forget Gammy. 

KRUGER

Who's Gammy? 

GEORGE

There's no Gammy. 

KRUGER

Maybe there should be a Gammy. 

GEORGE

Oh, no. 

KRUGER

George. 

ALL

Gammy! Gammy! Gammy! Gammy! Gammy! Gammy! Gammy! 

GEORGE

Gammy's gettin' upset! 

GEORGE

Man, I'm starving. 

ELAINE

How can you be hungry after what you ate at that Mets game? 

GEORGE

Because ballpark food doesn't count as real food. 

JERRY

Right. It's just an activity. It's like that paddle with the ball and the rubber band. 

KRAMER

You know, my friend Bob Saccamano made a fortune off of those. See he came up with the idea for the rubber band. Before that, people would just hit the ball, and it would fly away. 

JERRY

I can't believe you all made me leave before the end of the game. 

ELAINE

Oh, come on, Jerry. It was 9 to nothing. We were getting shellacked. 

GEORGE

Those nachos are killing me. 

ELAINE

I thought you were hungry. 

GEORGE

It's complicated. 

KRAMER

Come on, Jerry, you're going to miss the exit. 

JERRY

Keep your shirt on. I got it. 

ELAINE

Watch out for that maroon Golf. 

KRAMER

Oh, boy. 

JERRY

Look at this guy. He's trying to box me out. 

KRAMER

I'll tell you when you can go. Wait, wait, wait, Wait-- now, now, now. No, no, no. Go, go! No, no. Wait-- now, now! Now! Jerry! Go--ahh... 

JERRY

Oh, calm down, maroon Golf. He thinks I cut him off. He accelerated. 

KRAMER

You want me to moon him? Ooh, let's moon him. Roll up your window. Let's do a pressed ham under glass. 

ELAINE

Oh, no, I couldn't do that. 

KRAMER

Look at this, look at this. He's giving us the finger. 

ELAINE

Oh, all right. 

KRAMER

Yeah. 

GEORGE

So I saw that new movie about the Hindenburg. 

ELAINE

Oh, yeah. What's that called? 

GEORGE

Blimp: The Hindenburg Story. 

JERRY

How was it? 

GEORGE

I found it morose. Why dwell on these negative themes? 

JERRY

Yeah. They should make a movie about all the Hindenburg flights that made it. 

GEORGE

Anyway, right in the middle, the ship blows up-- burning debris, bodies falling-- and then just as this eerie silence settles over the airfield, I yelled out, 'That's gotta hurt!' 

JERRY

Heh. 

GEORGE

The place went nuts. 

JERRY

Imagine the laugh you could have gotten if you'd yelled that out at the actual disaster. 

GEORGE

Yeah. 

KRAMER

Why are we slowing down? 

JERRY

What is that music? 

GEORGE

What's with all these flags? 

JERRY

Oh, no. 

JERRY

It's the Puerto Rican Day parade! 

ELAINE

Ohh! Oh, the city shuts down Fifth avenue. They never let anyone through. We're never getting home. 

KRAMER

All right. I'm gonna check it out. Aiee. mucho trafico. 

FOOTAGE

Puerto Rican Day parade.] 

KRAMER

Yeah...uhh...well, the streets are all blocked. I think every Puerto Rican in the world is out here. 

MAN

Well, it is our day. 

KRAMER

Whoo. Wrong car. Sorry. 

RADIO

And the Mets score two in the eighth inning. 

JERRY

See? If we had stayed, we could have seen those runs. 

GEORGE

I could have had some ice cream. I think that might have calmed down the nachos. 

ELAINE

I'm going to miss 60 Minutes. You know, I hate to miss 60 Minutes. It's part of my Sunday weekend wind-down. 

JERRY

I don't know how you can unwind with that clock ticking. It makes me anxious. 

KRAMER

All right, gentlemen, I scouted it out. I think we can get out over there. 

JERRY

But that's a one-way street coming this way. Besides, how am I gonna get all the way over there? 

GEORGE

Just inch over. You worm your way. 

ELAINE

Just do it, Jerry. Uhh. This exhaust. I'm gonna throw up. 

KRAMER

You know, you should make yourself throw up. 

ELAINE

Huh? 

KRAMER

You know you're going to. 

JERRY

All right, I'm worming. 

KRAMER

Hey, Jerry. You know who the grand marshal is of this thing? None other than Miss Chita Rivera. 

JERRY

They're not letting me in. 

GEORGE

My hand is out. 

JERRY

Well, I think we're gonna need more than a hand. They have to see a human face. 

ELAINE

You sure you want his face? 

KRAMER

No, no, no. It was Mar&iacute;a Conchita Alonso. 

GEORGE

This guy's giving me the stare-ahead. 

JERRY

The stare-ahead. I hate that. I use it all the time. 

GEORGE

Look at me! I am man! I am you! 

GEORGE

All right, he's letting you in. Thank you! Creep. 

KRAMER

Oh! I know who it is. Stacy Keach. 

JERRY

One more lane to go. 

GEORGE

All right! We're here! 

LAMAR

Oh, look who's here. My old buddy, black Saab. 

JERRY

Maroon Golf. 

LAMAR

Where you goin', black Saab? You seem to be a tad askew. 

JERRY

Could you move your car back a little? 

LAMAR

Oh. Sorry. I seem to have cut you off. 

ELAINE

All right, I think I know where this is going, and I am going somewhere else. 

JERRY

You can't do that. You can't just leave the group. 

ELAINE

I've been trying to leave this group for 10 years. Vaya con dios. 

KRAMER

Con dios? Well, that's rude. 

JERRY

Can you believe her? 

GEORGE

Yeah. I'll see you later. 

JERRY

Where are you going? 

GEORGE

The movies. Blimp is playing right there. 

JERRY

You're going to that again? Why? Just to do that stupid line? 

GEORGE

It's a performance, Jerry. Like what you do. 

JERRY

That's not what I do. 

GEORGE

Isn't it? 

JERRY

Maybe a little. Ah, hell, I guess it is. 

KRAMER

You know, actually, Jerry, you haven't worked a room that big in a while. 

FOOTAGE

Taxis stuck in traffic]. 

ELAINE

Look at that guy's dog. I hate it when their ears get flipped inside out like that. Why doesn't he fix it? 

ELAINE

Hey! Fold your dog's ear back! 

ELAINE

Ooh! This isn't moving! I could walk faster than this. 

DRIVER

No, you can't. 

ELAINE

Yes, I can. Here. I'm outta here. 

ELAINE

Oh, now it's moving. Oh, yeah. I knew it. Hey! Hey! 

DRIVER

Where to? 

ELAINE

That's cute. That's really cute. Oh! Come on! All right. Bye again. 

ELAINE

Hey. Taxi! Taxi! 

GEORGE

Ladies. I, uh, I haven't seen this before. 

GUY

Gimme a box of those and one of those. 

GEORGE

Excuse me, are you the guy with that funny laser? 

GUY

The laser's not funny. I'm funny. 

GEORGE

Yeah. The thing is, I, uh...I had this little zinger of my own I wanted to try. 

GUY

Uh-huh. 

GEORGE

It's right in the explosion scene. So if you could just...leave me a little window. You know, my, uh, my aunt had a thing removed with a laser. All right, I don't want to interrupt your meal, so... 

JERRY

I've gotta see this game. If it wasn't for this guy, we could get out of here. 

LAMAR

This traffic's a killer, ain't it? 

KRAMER

You want to get outta here? Here's what we do. We leave the car here, we take the plates off, we scratch the serial number off the engine block, and we walk away. 

JERRY

Walk away? 

KRAMER

You've got insurance. You tell them that the car was stolen, and then you get another one free. 

JERRY

Isn't there a deductible? 

KRAMER

All right, what is your deductible? 

JERRY

I don't know. 

KRAMER

Yes, because they've already deducted it. 

JERRY

From what? 

KRAMER

The car, which we're leaving. So the net is zero. See you pocket the money, if there is any, and you get a new car. 

JERRY

We're not leaving the car! 

KRAMER

All right. If you refuse to grow up and scam your insurance company, you'll have to work this out with maroon Golf. 

JERRY

Absolutely not. He sped up. 

RADIO

Swung on, line hard toward left center field. That's in the gap, that's a base hit. 

JERRY

I'm ready to talk. 

GEORGE

That's gotta hurt! 

GEORGE

It's...gotta hurt! Hurt! Because...Aaarrrrrgh! 

GEORGE

Damn you, laser guy! You had to grab it all with your lowbrow laser shtick! You're just a prop comic! Where's the craft?! 

KRAMER

Ok, here's the deal. He wants you to acknowledge that you cut him off with an 'I am sorry' wave. 

JERRY

What's that? 

KRAMER

You raise the hand, lower the head-- 'I'm sorry, I'm sorry. The buttons are really big on the car. I don't understand it. I haven't read the manual. Ooh!' You get my drift. 

JERRY

Ok! 

LAMAR

Hallelujah. Praise the lord. But I'll take it. 

KRAMER

Yes! All right, Lamar, back it up a little bit so we can get out now. 

GEORGE

All right. At last, we're finally gettin' out of here. 

JERRY

What's that on your forehead? 

GEORGE

It's probably chocolate. 

JERRY

Hey, is that one of those laser pointers? 

KRAMER

Hey, Jerry, crank up the Floyd. It's a George laserium! 

GEORGE

All right, stop it! Stay away from my breasts! Chest! 

JERRY

See ya around maroon Golf. And, by the way, that was an 'I'm not sorry' wave. 

LAMAR

What was that? 

JERRY

I'm glad I cut you off, because black Saab rules! So long, jackass! 

JERRY

Elaine?! 

ELAINE

Jerry?! 

LAMAR

Jackass? So I'm a jackass now? 

JERRY

So if everyone would just put their cars in reverse at the same time, we can do this. All right, on the count of three. Can everyone hear me? Hey, amigo, are you paying attention? 

MAN

Buenos dias, my friend. 

JERRY

Not you! The guy in the Amigo. 

ELAINE

Uh, well, uh, here--here is good. 

DRIVER

Oh, yeah, sure, and now I'm gonna be stuck here. But you knew the way to go! You went to college! 

ELAINE

Hey, I went to Tufts! That was my safety school! So don't talk to me about hardship. 

ELAINE

Boy, eh, can you believe this mess? 

JERRY

Elaine, why did you have the cab come down the street?! We were almost out! 

LAMAR

So that was your girlfriend that blocked you in. That's real good. 

ELAINE

I'm not his girlfriend. Well, actually, we used to date, but not anymore. 

JERRY

Elaine, he doesn't need- 

LAMAR

Used to date? So I guess you found out he's a jackass. 

JERRY

'Cause that's what's gonna happen. 

KRAMER

Wow. He's givin' you a mustache. Where is this guy? 

GEORGE

Don't look around. Don't look around. That's what he wants. 

ELAINE

All right. Well, I'll see ya. Hey, George, I think there's a sniper lookin' to pop ya. 

GEORGE

This thing can't hurt me, can it? I mean, it is a laser. What if it hits my eye? 

JERRY

I don't know. 

GEORGE

I can't be blind, Jerry The blind are courageous. 

KRAMER

You'll be fine as long as it doesn't hit you right in the pupil, 'Cause then the whole ball will go up like the Death Star. Tchoo! I gotta go find a bathroom. 

JERRY

Hold it, George. Don't move. It's right between your eyes. 

GEORGE

Oh, my god. 

JERRY

Hey, there's the soda guy. 

LAMAR

Hey, jackass! Get me a diet Dr. Pepper! 

JERRY

All right! 

MAN

Hey, hey, hey! 

WOMAN

Wha--ow! 

ELAINE

Oh, this is nuts! I can't get across anywhere! 

MAN

Well, none of us can! We're trapped! 

WOMAN

Ow! 

ELAINE

Hey! Hey, everyone. This way. I think we can get out through here. 

MAN

Oh, I don't know if that's such a good idea. 

ELAINE

Look! No one knows how long this parade is gonna last! They are a very festive people. All I know is that it's Sunday night, and I have got to unwind! Now who's with me?! 

WOMAN

Father? 

PRIEST

None of us saw the nylon flap. That might mean something. 

WOMAN

Oh, all right, all right! 

ELAINE

All right! Come on. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. 

MAN

But it's dark! 

ELAINE

Get in there! 

KRAMER

Yes, uh, I'm interested in the apartment. 

WOMAN

Yes! Come in, come in. 

KRAMER

Ok. 

WOMAN

I'm Christine Nyhart. 

KRAMER

Oh. Delicious to meet you. 

WOMAN

Did the broker send you over? 

KRAMER

Uh, yes, most likely, yes. I'm, uh, H.E. Pennypacker. I'm a wealthy industrialist and philanthropist and, uh, a bicyclist. And, um, yes, I'm looking for a place where I can settle down with my, uh, peculiar habits, and, uh, the women that I frequent with. (sniffing wall) Mmm. Mombassa, hmm? 

WOMAN

The asking price is $1.5 million. 

KRAMER

Oh, I spend that much on after shave. Yes, I buy and sell men like myself every day. Now, I assume that there's a waterfall grotto? 

WOMAN

No. 

KRAMER

How about a bathroom? 

WOMAN

It has 4. 

KRAMER

Yes, and where would the absolute nearest one be? 

WOMAN

Just down the hall. 

KRAMER

Oh, thank you. 

ELAINE

Oh, don't worry. We'll get you home to your husband real soon. 

WOMAN

I'm not married. 

ELAINE

Well, I, for one, really respect that. 

WOMAN

Oh, thank you. 

ELAINE

Hey! Guess who's not married. 

MAN

Is the boyfriend still in the picture? 

ELAINE

Come on, father, you can make it. 

PRIEST

No, I can't. I've got a bad hip. Go on without me. 

ELAINE

No! I won't! 

PRIEST

Leave me! you must. 

ELAINE

All right. Take it easy. 

ELAINE

All right, we can move faster without father o'gimpy. 

PRIEST

I heard that! 

LAMAR

You know, I don't think I've ever seen a man driving a Saab convertible. Still haven't. 

JERRY

Ho ho! 

JERRY

What seems to be the problem, officer? 

GEORGE

They're for protection, Jerry. Can you tell where I'm lookin'? 

JERRY

At me? 

GEORGE

No. 

JERRY

Oh. It's back. 

GEORGE

Bring it on, baby 

JERRY

What if it gets in the side? 

GEORGE

The side? 

JERRY

Yeah. Wouldn't it just bounce back and forth between your cornea and the mirror, faster and faster, getting more and more intense, until finally- 

GEORGE

All right! 

JERRY

Oh. It's in your eye now. 

KRAMER

Hola, Jerry! I'm into this Puerto Rican day! The sights! The sounds! The hot, spicy flavor of it all! It's caliente, Jerry! 

JERRY

Kramer, the Mets have got men on base! 

KRAMER

Yeah, I know! I was watchin' the game. 

JERRY

You were watchin'? Where? 

JERRY

Oh, that was a strike! Did you see that?! 

WOMAN

Would you like to see the rest of the apartment, Mister, um-- 

JERRY

Eh...Varnsen. Kel Varnsen. Actually, this room intrigues me. Why is it called the TV room? 

WOMAN

Well, it's-- 

JERRY

Balk?! How was that a balk?! You have any snacks? 

WOMAN

Mr. Varnsen, if you like the apartment, I should tell you I've also had some interest from a wealthy industrialist. 

JERRY

Not Pennypacker! 

WOMAN

You know him? 

JERRY

I wish I didn't. Brace yourself, madam, for an all-out bidding war. But this time, advantage Varnsen! 

GEORGE

Wait a second. I think I see where that laser guy is. No! Don't look! Don't look. Oh, yeah, that's him. Ok. I'm gonna sneak up on him. Now the hunted becomes the hunter. 

ELAINE

We should be able to get across right through here! 

WOMAN

It's a dead end! 

ELAINE

Oh, no! I thought-- 

MAN

You thought?! We're gonna die in the dark! I knew it! I knew it! We're gonna die! 

ELAINE

Get a hold of yourself! 

WOMAN

Oh, come on! 

ELAINE

Sorry. Somebody...help us! 

MAN

!Mira! !Mira! Stacy Keach! 

ELAINE

We're down here! Help! 

MAN

There's people down there! Hold on! 

ELAINE

Let us out. There's an unmarried pregnant woman down here. 

WOMAN

Don't judge me! 

ELAINE

Help us up so we can cross the street? 

OFFICER

Nah, nah, You can't cross here. There's a parade. 

ELAINE

But we've come so far. We just want to unwind. 

OFFICER

Hey, what can I tell ya? 

MAN

Wanna make out some more? 

ELAINE

Oh, god! Let us out! 

GEORGE

That wasn't a laser pen. 

MAN

No. It's just a pen. 

GEORGE

Oh, that's funny 

MAN

No. You have, like, a dot on your face. Whoever's doing that is very clever. 

KRAMER

Come on, man. You need to lighten up. You know, a feeling like this only happens once a year. 

KRAMER

Yeah, it's like this every day in Puerto Rico. 

KRAMER

See, now you're getting the spirit of it, huh? 

KRAMER

Ooh! !Dios mio! 

MAN

Hey! There's a guy burning the Puerto Rican flag! 

BOB

Who! Who is burning the flag?! 

KRAMER

Oh, no. 

BOB

Him?! 

CEDRIC

That's not very nice. 

KRAMER

It was an accident. 

BOB

Do you know what day this is? Because I know what day this is, they know what day this is, so I was wondering if you know what day this is! 

CEDRIC

Because it's Puerto Rican day. 

BOB

Maybe we should stomp you like you stomp the flag! What do you think of that? 

KRAMER

Now look, I just have one thing to say to you boys. Mama! 

WOMAN

Right this way, Mr. Vandelay. 

GEORGE

Well, this is a lovely apartment. Lovely! My kids are gonna go crazy. I, uh, I wonder if I could see the bathrooms. Preferably one with some paint thinner and, uh, some rags? 

WOMAN

It's down the hall. 

JERRY

Oh, hello... 

GEORGE

Art. 

JERRY

Mr. Vandelay, of course. 

WOMAN

You two know each other? 

WOMAN

Mr. Pennypacker! 

KRAMER

Uh, yes, uh, I--I wanted to, uh, stop by and make sure that my shark tank fits-- uh, hello. 

WOMAN

Mr. Pennypacker, this is Mr. Vandelay, And you know Mr. Varnsen 

KRAMER

Uh, Varnsen. 

JERRY

Pennypacker. 

KRAMER

Vandelay. 

GEORGE

Pennypacker. Varnsen. 

JERRY

Vandelay. Wait a second. Mr. Pennypacker, if you're here, and Mr. Vandelay is also here, then who's watching the factory? 

KRAMER

The factory? 

JERRY

The Saab factory? 

KRAMER

Jerry, that's in Sweden. 

JERRY

My car! 

KRAMER

Well, you know, it's like this every day in Puerto Rico. 

GEORGE

Jerry, the Mets lost. 

JERRY

I love a parade! 

GEORGE

How do you suppose they did that? 

KRAMER

Well...there's no logical explanation. All right. Well, shall we go home? 

JERRY

Well, what about my car? 

KRAMER

Well, Jerry, you can't deduct it now. 

JERRY

Hey, there's Elaine. 

ELAINE

Hey. 

JERRY

Well, you look, uh...relaxed. 

ELAINE

Well, it is Sunday night, and you know how I like to unwind. 

LAMAR

Hey, black Saab. Looks like that building cut you off! Ha ha ha! See ya around! 

JERRY

Well, at least he didn't- 

LAMAR

Jackass! 

JERRY

Somebody remember where we parked. 

KRAMER

This was a fun day. It's nice to get out. 

GEORGE

I can't eat this without catsup. Would it kill her to check up on us? Would that be a terrible thing? 'How's everything? Do you need anything? What can I do for you?' 

JERRY

I know what you mean. 

GEORGE

Do ya? 

JERRY

It's like going out with someone and you never hear from them again. 

GEORGE

Same thing! 

JERRY

Not really, but it's something. Ask the people behind you. 

GEORGE

Excuse me. Are you using your catsup? 

WOMAN

What do you think? You want to give him the catsup? 

MAN

It's up to you. 

WOMAN

You know what? I don't think so. I'm going to need it from time to time. 

JERRY

So what are you doing later? You want to go to the movies? 

GEORGE

Nah - what for? 

JERRY

To see a movie. 

GEORGE

I've been to the movies. 

JERRY

Not this movie. 

GEORGE

They're all the same. You go, you sit, you eat popcorn, you watch. I'm sick of it. 

JERRY

Did you shower today? 

GEORGE

Yeah. 

JERRY

That's usually the kind of mood I'm in when I haven't showered. 

GEORGE

When is it going to be my turn, Jerry? When do I get my 15 minutes? I want my 15 minutes! 

JERRY

Oh, quit complaining. At least you have your health. 

GEORGE

Ah! Health's not good enough. I want more than health. Health's not doing it for me anymore. I'm sick of health. 

WOMAN

All right, we're done. You can have it now. 

GEORGE

Oh, very gracious. 

MAN

Nice day 

GEORGE

Yeah. 

JERRY

What is that? 

KRAMER

Hey! JoJo! 

JERRY

Ey, ey! 

ELAINE

All right, thanks for the ride, Kramer. 

KRAMER

No, thank you. So what are you doing? 

JERRY

Nothing. 

KRAMER

Come on, let's go to the beach. 

GEORGE

What are you crazy? 

KRAMER

What? It's a beautiful day. 

JERRY

Have a good time. 

KRAMER

Yeah, there's something in the air today. You feel it? There's something in the air. 

JERRY

You know you're turning into Burt Lancaster? 

KRAMER

Yeah, there's something in the air. 

ELAINE

Oh, I forgot to call Jill. Jill. Hi, it's Elaine. How is your father? Is everything okay? What? I can't hear you so good. There's a lot of static. Wha? I'm going to call you back. 

JERRY

Jill's father is in the hospital and you call to ask about him on a cell phone? 

ELAINE

What? No good? 

JERRY

Faux pas. 

ELAINE

Faux pas? 

GEORGE

Big hefty stinking faux pas. 

ELAINE

Why? 

JERRY

You can't make a health inquiry on a cell phone. It's like saying 'I don't want to take up any of my important time in my home so I'll just get it out of the way on the street.' 

GEORGE

On-the-street cell-phone call is the lowest phone call you can make. 

JERRY

It's an act of total disregard. It's selfish. 

GEORGE

It's dismissive. 

JERRY

It's pompous. 

GEORGE

Why don't you think before you do something? 

ELAINE

Here's a thought - Bye bye. 

GEORGE

Too much? 

GEORGE

Boy - I'm really surprised at Elaine - that whole phone business - she should know better than that. 

JERRY

Hey - hey - hey! 

GEORGE

What? 

JERRY

Where do you think this relationship is? If you are thinking of instituting an open-door urination policy, let me disabuse you of that notion right now, my friend. 

GEORGE

You're so uptight. 

JERRY

Uptight? Let's all just have a big pee party. Hey everybody, grab a bucket. We're going up to Jerry's. It's a pee party. 

TAPE

Jerry, this is Elizabeth Clark calling from James Kimbrough's office at NBC. Could you please give us a call?Thanks. 

JERRY

Hello. Yeah, hi, this is Jerry Seinfeld calling for James Kimbrough. Hello? Hi? Uh huh, really, uh, no problem, definitely, ok, buhbye. That was James Kimbrough. 

GEORGE

Who's he? 

JERRY

He is the new president of NBC. He wants to sit down with us and talk about 'Jerry.' 

GEORGE

Our show, 'Jerry'? 

JERRY

Right. 

GEORGE

'Jerry', oh my God. He wants to talk about 'Jerry'? 

JERRY

Yeah! 

GEORGE

When? 

JERRY

Today, like right now. 

GEORGE

Right now? 'Jerry'? 

JERRY

'Jerry'! 

GEORGE

He wants to talk about 'Jerry'? 

JERRY

He wants to talk about 'Jerry'! 

GEORGE

'Jerry'! 

JERRY

'Jerry'! 

GEORGE

Can I go like this? 

JERRY

Sure! 

GEORGE

No sports jacket? I don't need a sports jacket? Writers wear sports jackets. 

JERRY

Forget the sports jacket. 

GEORGE

I won't feel like a writer. 

JERRY

You're not a writer. 

GEORGE

Right! 

GEORGE

Water. Need some water! Water here! 

JERRY

Ok, now listen, I don't want any scenes in here like the last time. 

GEORGE

Don't worry, don't worry, no scenes. 

JERRY

Don't blow this. 

GEORGE

I will not blow this. 

JERRY

If he says he doesn't want it to be a show about nothing, don't go nuts. 

GEORGE

It's fine, it doesn't have to be about nothing. 

JERRY

He might not want nothing. 

GEORGE

Something, nothing, I could care less. 

JERRY

He might want a show about anything and everything. 

GEORGE

Anything, everything, something, nothing - Who the hell cares? Put me down. I'm down! 

JERRY

All right. 

RECEPTIONIST

Mr. Kimbrough is ready to see you 

GEORGE

Magic time. 

JERRY

What? 

GEORGE

nothing 

RECEPTIONIST

Mr. Kimbrough. 

STU

Hey, Jerry, good to see you. 

GEORGE

Hey, hey, hey! 

STU

How you been? 

JERRY

Good, good. You remember George. 

STU

George, good to see you. 

GEORGE

Hello Stu. 

STU

You remember Jay Crespi. 

GEORGE

Jay Crespi, how am I gonna forget Jay Crespi? 

STU

This is James Kimbrough. 

KIMBROUGH

Nice to meet you, pleasure, thanks for coming in. 

GEORGE

Kimbrough. 

JERRY

Don't spell. 

GEORGE

K-I-M-B-R-O-U-G-H 

KIMBROUGH

That's right. 

GEORGE

It's a talent I have. 

KIMBROUGH

Why don't we sit down, glad you're here. 

GEORGE

Woo! Some day out there - You ever see weather like that? Woo! It's crisp - it's crispy crisp. 

JERRY

Shut up, George. 

KIMBROUGH

Can I get you anything? 

GEORGE

What do we have in the fruit department? 

JERRY

Oy. 

STU

Pineapple. 

GEORGE

Oh, that's a dangerous fruit. It's like a weapon that thing, got spikes on the end. You can get killed from one of those things. 

KIMBROUGH

Anyway, let me tell you why I called. When I took over here last month, I reviewed what was in development,and it was pretty much same old, same old. 

GEORGE

Been there, done that. 

KIMBROUGH

Right. I was looking for something different. Something that would have people talking at the water coolers. 

GEORGE

Water coolers? 

CRESPI

We call it a water-cooler show. 

JERRY

Because the next day in the offices, people gather around the water coolers to talk about it, right? 

GEORGE

See, I think people would talk about it at the coffee machines. 

JERRY

Well it's probably just easier to say 'water cooler show' than 'coffee machine show.' 

GEORGE

It's really not accurate. Nobody drinks from a water cooler any more - they use bottles. 

JERRY

But I think Mr. Kimbrough makes a good point. 

KIMBROUGH

Anyway, Stu here started telling me about a show, 'Jerry', that he developed five years ago. 

STU

I have always loved it. 

KIMBROUGH

He said it was a show about nothing. So, I saw the pilot and I've got to tell you - I flipped out. 

CRESPI

He totally flipped out. 

KIMBROUGH

What I want to do is put it on the air. 13-episode commitment. Start it off on Wednesday night, build up an audience. This show needs time to grow. I love that Kramer guy. 

JERRY

He's a little off the wall. 

CRESPI

Oh yeah. 

STU

Kramer. 

KIMBROUGH

And Elaine - I wouldn't mind seeing something happening between you two. 

JERRY

Definitely. 

GEORGE

I tell you, I really don't think so-called relationship humor is what this show is all about. 

KIMBROUGH

Or we could not do the show altogether, how about that? 

GEORGE

Or we could get them together. Woo! 

GEORGE

Yeah! 

JERRY

Yeah! 

ELAINE

Jill, hi, it's Elaine. Well, I'm calling from my home. Indoors. Well, I was just calling to see how your fa.. I'm sorry, I'm getting another call. Hang on just a second. Hello? 

JERRY

Hi. Elaine, it's me. 

ELAINE

Jerry, I'm on the other line. 

JERRY

No no - this is an emergency - get off the phone. 

ELAINE

I'm sorry, Jill. I'm going to have to take this call. Jerry, what's the emergency? 

JERRY

The 'Jerry''s back on - the TV show! George and I are moving to California! 

ELAINE

That's the emergency? 

JERRY

Did you hear what I said? 

ELAINE

I was on the other line talking to Jill. 

JERRY

Jill? Well, why didn't you say so? 

ELAINE

You said it was an emergency. 

JERRY

So now she's lost a phone face-off? That's even worse than your cell phone walk-and-talk. 

HELEN

Congratulations, they're doing the show. 

MORTY

They should have put that show on 5 years ago. Bunch of idiots at that network. Can I tell you something, Jerry? It's all crap on TV. The only thing I watch is Xena the Warrior Princess. She must be about six-six. 

HELEN

She's not six-six. 

MORTY

Jerry, you ever watch that? 

JERRY

Yeah, it's pretty good. 

ESTELLE

They picked up the show? 

GEORGE

I'm moving to California. 

FRANK

Oh baby-doll, this kid's going places, I told you. 

ESTELLE

The NBC guy liked it? 

GEORGE

Of course he liked it. 

ESTELLE

He told you he liked it? 

GEORGE

He wouldn't put it on if he didn't like it. 

ESTELLE

Well, what are you doing? 

GEORGE

I'm writing. 

ESTELLE

You know how to write? 

FRANK

Without the writing, you have nothing. You're the ones that make them look good. 

ESTELLE

Since when do you know how to write? I never saw you write anything. 

GEORGE

Ma?! 

ESTELLE

I don't know how you're going to write all those shows. And where are you get all the ideas? 

FRANK

Would you leave him alone? You'll shatter his confidence! 

GEORGE

I don't need any ideas. It's a show about nothing. 

ESTELLE

Nothing. Please. I'll tell you the truth - the whole thing sounds pretty stupid to me. 

JERRY

NBC is letting me use their private jet? And I can go anywhere I want? That's fantastic! Thanks. Great. Okay, bye. 

KRAMER

Oh hey! 

JERRY

Hey - how was the beach? 

KRAMER

Oh, you missed it, buddy - lot of femininas - some major femininas 

JERRY

I had a little meeting today at NBC. What are you doing? 

KRAMER

You know, I went swimming and I can't get this water out of my ear. 

JERRY

So do you remember five years ago, we did that pilot, 'Jerry'? Well, the new guy at NBC wants to do it. They're putting it on the air! They're giving us a 13-episode commitment. George and I are moving to California! 

KRAMER

You're moving to California? 

JERRY

Yeah, only for a while. 

KRAMER

Yeah, but Jerry, what happens if the show's a hit? You could be out there for years! You might never come back. 

JERRY

No, I'll be back. 

KRAMER

Jerry. It's L.A. Nobody leaves. She's a seductress, she's a siren, she's a virgin, she's a whore. 

JERRY

And my agent said as a bonus, I can use their private jet, so we'll all go somewhere - the four of us, one big fling before George and I go to California. 

KRAMER

Fling! 

ELAINE

So we can go anywhere we want? 

JERRY

Anywhere. 

ELAINE

Why are they doing this? 

JERRY

I think they want to make it up to us cause they let this thing sit on their shelf for five years. 

ELAINE

This is all very exciting. 

GEORGE

So? Where are we going? 

KRAMER

I say Japan. 

ELAINE

Why Japan? 

KRAMER

Oh - geishas - they cater to your every whim. They're shy at first, but they're quite skilled at conversation. They can discuss anything from world affairs to the fine art of fishing - or baking. 

ELAINE

Oh - I got it - how about Russia? 

JERRY

Russia, it's so bleak. 

ELAINE

It's not bleak - it's springtime. 

JERRY

It's still bleak. 

ELAINE

You can't be bleak in spring. 

JERRY

You can be bleak in spring. 

GEORGE

If you're bleak, you're bleak. 

ELAINE

What about Switzerland? 

KRAMER

Oh - Switzerland - the Von Trapp family, huh? 

GEORGE

It's a bit hilly - no? 

ELAINE

You're not going to do any walking. 

GEORGE

What if I want to walk around a little? 

ELAINE

So then you'll walk down the hill and we'll pick you up. 

GEORGE

What if I'm at the bottom? 

ELAINE

All right! You know what, just forget it! 

JERRY

Alright - come on - come on now, people. Let's face it, we're not all going to agree on anything. Why don't we all just go to Paris? 

ELAINE

I'll go to Paris. 

GEORGE

Me too. 

KRAMER

Oh yeah - oui oui. 

JERRY

So that's it - it's settled, we're going to Paris. 

GROUP

Yeah! 

ELAINE

Hey. NBC limo is downstairs - beep beep beep. {NBC tune} I'm just going to call Jill one more time before we go. 

JERRY

Wait, you can't make a call like that on your way out. You can't rush that conversation. 

ELAINE

Well, I can't call from the limo. Can I call from the plane? 

JERRY

First you make a cell-phone walk-and-talk, then she loses a call-waiting face-off, now you're talking about a plane call? 

ELAINE

All right, I'll just have to call her from Paris. 

NEWMAN

Hello, Jerry. 

JERRY

Hello, Newman. What gives? 

NEWMAN

I was speaking earlier with Kramer and he mentioned something about a private jet to Paris? 

JERRY

Yeah, that's right. 

NEWMAN

Well, I hear it's quite beautiful there this time of year, and of course you know I'm one-quarter French. 

JERRY

Really. 

NEWMAN

Oh yes, in fact I still have family there. This probably won't interest you, but I have a cousin there who's suffering very badly. She's lost all use of her muscles. She can only communicate by blinking. I would so love to see her - bring a ray of sunshine into her tragic life. But alas, I can't afford it, for I am, as you know, but a simple postal worker. 

JERRY

That's a shame. 

NEWMAN

Take me! Take me! 

JERRY

Oh, forget it. Pull yourself together. You're making me sick. Be a man! 

NEWMAN

All right! But hear me and hear me well - The day will come. Oh yes, mark my words, Seinfeld - your day of reckoning is coming. When an evil wind will blow through your little playworld, and wipe that smug smile off your face. And I'll be there, in all my glory, watching - watching as it all comes crumbling down. 

CAPTAIN

Ah, Jerry? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

CAPTAIN

I'm Captain Maddox this is my co-pilot, Kurt Adams. Ready to go to Paris? 

JERRY

All set. We'll just grab the bags. 

CAPTAIN

Don't worry about that. We'll take care of them for you. 

JERRY

Just keeps on getting better and better. 

JERRY

Not bad. 

ELAINE

Wow! 

KRAMER

The only way to fly. 

GEORGE

This is it? 

GEORGE

I'm sorry - I have to say, I'm a little disappointed, I thought it would be a lot nicer. 

JERRY

You're complaining about a private jet? 

GEORGE

You think this is the plane that Ted Danson gets? 

JERRY

Ted Danson is not even on the network anymore. 

GEORGE

Still, I bet when they gave him a plane, it was a lot nicer than this one. 

ELAINE

Will you shut up? You are ruining the whole trip. 

GEORGE

This is a real piece of junk. I don't even feel safe on this thing. I have a good mind to write a letter toMr. Kimbrough. 

JERRY

You're not writing any letters! 

ELAINE

Will you turn around? 

GEORGE

Why? 

ELAINE

You are annoying me sitting like that. It's effeminate. 

GEORGE

It's effeminate to sit like this? 

ELAINE

Yes, I think it's a little effeminate. 

GEORGE

How is this effeminate? 

ELAINE

I don't know - it just is. 

GEORGE

Kramer, what are you doing? 

JERRY

Still got water in your ear? 

KRAMER

Can't get rid of it. Maybe it leaked inside my brain. 

GEORGE

Would you stop that? It's not safe to be jumping up and down on a plane. 

KRAMER

I got to get it out, I can't take this anymore. 

GEORGE

Kramer, don't be fooling around up here. 

GEORGE

Kramer! 

CAPTAIN

Hey, get the hell out of here! 

ELAINE

What is that? 

GEORGE

Oh my God! 

ELAINE

What is that noise? What is that noise? 

JERRY

Kramer, what the hell did you do? 

KRAMER

I lost my balance. 

ELAINE

Oh my God! 

ELAINE

What's going on? 

JERRY

Kramer! 

KRAMER

It was an accident. 

GEORGE

I told you to stop with the hopping. 

ELAINE

Oh my God, we're going down. We're going to die! 

GEORGE

Just when I was doing great. I told you God wouldn't let me be successful. 

JERRY

Is this it? Is this how it ends? It can't- it can't end like this. 

KRAMER

I'm ready! I'm ready! Glory hallelujah! 

GEORGE

Jerry? Jerry can you hear me? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

GEORGE

There's something I have to tell you. 

JERRY

What? What is it? 

GEORGE

I cheated in the contest. 

ELAINE

What? 

JERRY

What? 

GEORGE

The contest - I cheated. 

JERRY

Why? 

GEORGE

Because I'm a cheater! I had to tell you. 

JERRY

Great - I won. 

ELAINE

Jerry, I gotta tell you something too. 

JERRY

Yeah, Elaine I got something I want to say to you. 

ELAINE

No no - me first. 

JERRY

Alright. 

ELAINE

Jerry, I've always loved ..u.. 

GEORGE

Hey - What's going on? 

KRAMER

We're straightening out! 

ELAINE

We're straightening out? 

JERRY

We're straightening out! 

GEORGE

We're straightening out! 

GROUP

Yeah! 

CAPTAIN

Well, again, sorry about that little mishap. But once you get everything checked out there shouldn't be anymore problems. 

JERRY

Where are we? 

CAPTAIN

Latham, Massachusetts. Why don't you take a cab into town, get yourself something to eat. I got your beeper number - I'll beep you as soon as we're ready. 

JERRY

Okay. 

ELAINE

Okay. 

JERRY

We'll see you later. 

ELAINE

Well, what are we going to do about Paris? I mean are we actually going to get back on this plane? 

JERRY

I say we go back to New York, and take a regular flight. 

GEORGE

I'm not getting on a regular plane now - I'm all psyched up to go on a private jet. No way I'm getting on a regular plane. 

ELAINE

Well, I'm sure that they would fly us first class. 

GEORGE

First class doesn't make it anymore. Now you get on the phone with Kimbrough, tell him what happened and tell him to get another plane down here, but this time, the good one - the Ted Danson plane. 

JERRY

Alright, I'll feel him out. 

GEORGE

Yeah, just tell him to hurry it up. 

STRANGER

Nice day. 

JERRY

Another one? 

ROBBER

Alright fatso, out of the car. 

KRAMER

I want to capture this. 

ROBBER

Come on! Gimme your wallet. 

VOGEL

Don't shoot. 

JERRY

Well, there goes the money for the lipo. 

ELAINE

See, the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it's an easy getaway. You know? They can't really chase ya! 

GEORGE

He's actually doing him a favor. It's less money for him to buy food. 

ROBBER

I want your wallet. Come on. Come on, come on. 

JERRY

That's a shame. Alright, I'm gonna call NBC. 

VOGEL

Officer, he's stealing my car! Officer, I was carjacked. I was held up at gunpoint! He took my wallet, everything! 

JERRY

Okay, thanks anyway. They can't get another plane. 

KRAMER

All right, what's wrong with the plane we got? They're just checking it out. 

ELAINE

Forget it. 

JERRY

No, no, no. We're not getting on there. Come on, let's go get something to eat in Sticksville. 

OFFICER

All right, hold it right there. 

KRAMER

What? 

OFFICER

You're under arrest. 

JERRY

Under arrest? What for? 

OFFICER

Article 223-7 of the Latham County Penal Code. 

ELAINE

What? No, no - we didn't do anything. 

OFFICER

That's exactly right. The law requires you to help or assist anyone in danger as long as it's reasonable todo so. 

GEORGE

I never heard of that. 

OFFICER

It's new. It's called the Good Samaritan Law. Let's go. 

ELAINE

The Good Samaritan Law? Are they crazy? 

GEORGE

Why would we want to help somebody? 

ELAINE

I know. 

GEORGE

That's what nuns and Red Cross workers are for. 

KRAMER

The Samaritans were an ancient tribe - very helpful to people. 

ELAINE

Alright - um, excuse me, hi, could you tell me what kind of law this is. 

DEPUTY

Well, they just passed it last year. It's modeled after the French law. I heard about it after Princess Diana was killed and all those photographers were just standing around. 

JERRY

Oh, yeah. 

ELAINE

Oh, yeah. 

DEPUTY

You're the first ones to be arrested on it, probably in the whole country. 

GEORGE

All right, so what's the penalty here? Let's just pay the fine or something and get the hell out of here. 

DEPUTY

Well, it's not that easy. Now see, the law calls for a maximum fine of $85,000 and as much as five years in prison. 

ELAINE

What? 

GEORGE

Oh no no no no - we have to be in California next week. We're starting a TV show. 

DEPUTY

California? Oh gosh, I don't think so. Yeah, my guess is you're gonna be prosecuted. Better get yourselves a good lawyer. 

CHILES

Who told you to put the cheese on? Did I tell you to put the cheese on? I didn't tell you to put the cheese on. 

SECRETARY

Jerry Seinfeld on the phone. 

CHILES

You people with the cheese. It never ends. Hello? Uh huh. Uh huh. Uh huh. Good Samaritan Law? I never heard of it. You don't have to help anybody. That's what this country's all about. That's deplorable, unfathomable, improbable. Hold on. Suzie, cancel my appointment with Dr. Bison. And pack a bag for me. I want to get to Latham, Massachusetts,right away. 

HOYT

So they got Jackie Chiles, huh? (Sets down the newspaper) Uh hmm. You know what that means. This whole place is going to be swarming with media by the time this thing is over. You're not going to be able to find a hotel room in this town. The whole country is going to be watching us. Now we got to do whatever it takes to win it, no matter what the cost. The big issue in this trial is going to be character. I want you to find out everything you can about these people - and I mean everything. 

KRAMER

Mmmm, this is pretty good chow, huh? 

GEORGE

Would it kill him to check up on us? No - drops off the meals and that's it. I realize we're prisoners, but we're still entitled to catsup. 

ELAINE

I guess we could've called for help. 

JERRY

But then we would have missed the whole thing. 

KRAMER

I still had it on video. We could have watched it later. 

GEORGE

Yeah, he's right. 

JERRY

I forgot about the video. 

ELAINE

Sure - the video. 

ELAINE

What is that? 

JERRY

Plane's ready. 

RIVERA

Hi everybody, I'm Geraldo Rivera. Tonight we'll be talking about what most of you have probably been discussing in your homes, and around the water coolers in your offices. I am speaking of course of the controversial Good Samaritan trial that gets underway Thursday in Latham, Massachusetts. Now before we meet our distinguished panel, let's go to Latham live, where Jane Wells is standing by. Jane- 

WELLS

Yes. Good evening, Geraldo. 

RIVERA

What's the mood? What's going on tonight? 

WELLS

Well, Latham is fairly quite tonight, considering the media circus that has descended upon this quaint little town. 

RIVERA

And what about the defendants - the so-called New York Four. How are they holding up? 

WELLS

Well, I did speak with one of the deputies who had some contact with them, and he told me quote 'There's no love lost with that group.' 

RIVERA

Anything else, Jane? 

WELLS

There also seems to be some friction between Mr. Seinfeld, and Ms. Benes. The rumor is that they once dated, and it's possible that ended badly. 

RIVERA

Well, ladies and gentlemen, who know, maybe this trial will bring them closer together. Maybe they'll even end up getting married. 

HELEN

I hope you packed enough - this trial could last for weeks. 

MORTY

What's all that? 

HELEN

Cereal. 

MORTY

You're packing cereal? 

HELEN

I'm bringing it for Jerry. 

MORTY

You got enough here for a life sentence. 

HELEN

He likes it. He says he misses that more that anything. 

MORTY

So bring a snack-pack. 

ESTELLE

Poor Georgie, was it our fault this happened to him? Did we do something wrong? Maybe it was our fault. 

FRANK

Maybe it was your fault. It wasn't my fault. I can tell you that. 

ESTELLE

Oh, so it was my fault, but not yours. 

FRANK

You were the one who smothered him. 

ESTELLE

I did not smother him. 

FRANK

You smothered! He couldn't get any air! He couldn't breathe! He was suffocating! 

ESTELLE

Sure, and you were always in Korea with your religious chachkis. 

FRANK

I had to make a living! 

KRAMER

This is excellent huh? Don't worry I didn't use too much milk, cause I know we gotta make it last. 

JERRY

You know I've had to reduce my milk level. My whole life I've always filled to at least three quarters - sometimes, to the top of the cereal. Now, to conserve, I can't even see the milk anymore. It's a big adjustment. 

KRAMER

I bet. 

JERRY

It's one of the hardest things I've ever had to do. 

CHILES

Good morning. 

ELAINE

Good morning, Jackie. 

JERRY

Good morning. 

CHILES

Is everybody ready? Didn't I tell you I wanted you to wear the cardigan? 

GEORGE

It makes me look older. 

CHILES

Look older? Do you think this is a game? Is that what you think this is? I'm trying to give you amoral compass. You have no moral compass. You're going to walk into that courtroom, and the jury's going to see a mean, nasty, evil George Costanza. I want them to see Perry Como. No one's going to convict Perry Como. Perry Como helps out a fat tub who's getting robbed. 

CHILES

Do you think it's funny? 

JERRY

No. 

CHILES

You damn right it isn't. You better not be carrying on laughing in that courtroom, funny man. Cause if you start getting all smart-alecky, making wisecracks, acting a fool, you gonna find yourself in here for a long, long time. I don't like that tie. Suzie, get one of my ties from my briefcase. 

ELAINE

How do I look, Jackie? 

CHILES

Oh, you looking good. You look strong. You one fine-looking sexy lady. 

ELAINE

Thank you, Jackie. 

KRAMER

How bout me, Jackie? 

CHILES

Kramer, you always look good. You got respect for yourself. You're genuine. Jury's going to pick up on that. 

CHILES

Here. 

JERRY

This one? 

CHILES

That's right. 

JERRY

Do I have to? 

ELAINE

Jackie says put it on, Jerry. 

BAILIFF

All rise. Fourth District County Court, Latham, Massachusetts is now in session. The Honorable Judge Arthur Vandelay presiding. 

GEORGE

Vandelay? The judge's name is Vandelay? 

CHILES

Vanda who? 

GEORGE

Jerry, did you hear that? 

JERRY

Yeah. 

GEORGE

I think that's a good sign. 

VANDELAY

Is the District Attorney ready to proceed? 

HOYT

We are, Your Honor. 

VANDELAY

Mr. Hoyt. 

HOYT

Ladies and gentlemen, last year, our City Council by a vote of twelve to two, passed a Good Samaritan Law. Now, essentially, we made it a crime to ignore a fellow human being in trouble. Now this group from New York not only ignored, but, as we will prove, they actually mocked the victim as he was being robbed at gunpoint. I can guarantee you one other thing, ladies and gentlemen, this is not the first time they have behaved in this manner. On the contrary, they have quite a record of mocking and maligning. This is a history of selfishness, self-absorption, immaturity, and greed. And you will see how everyone who has come into contact with these four individuals has been abused, wronged, deceived and betrayed. This time, they have gone too far. This time they are going to be held accountable. This time, they are the ones who will pay. 

VANDELAY

Mr. Chiles. 

CHILES

I am shocked and chagrined, mortified and stupefied. This trial is outrageous! It is a waste of the taxpayers' time and money. It is a travesty of justice that these four people have been incarcerated while the real perpetrator is walking around laughing - lying and laughing, laughing and lying. You know what these four people were? They were innocentbystanders. Now, you just think about that term. Innocent. Bystanders. Because that's exactly what they were. We know theywere bystanders, nobody's disputing that. So how can a bystander be guilty? No such thing. Have you ever heard of a guilty bystander? No, because you cannot be a bystander and be guilty. Bystanders are by definition, innocent. That is the nature of bystanding. But no, they want to change nature here. They want to create a whole new animal - the guilty bystander. Don't you let them do it. Only you can stop them. 

VANDELAY

Is the prosecution ready to present its first witness? 

HOYT

We are, Your Honor. Call Officer Matt Vogel to the stand. 

BAILIFF

Call Matt Vogel. 

HOYT

So they were just standing there? 

VOGEL

Yes. 

HOYT

Did one of them have a video camera? 

VOGEL

Yes. 

HOYT

Your Honor, with the court's permission, we would like to play back that video and enter it into evidence as Exhibit A. 

VANDELAY

Proceed. 

VOGEL

Don't shoot. 

JERRY

Well, there goes the money for the lipo. 

ELAINE

See, the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it's an easy getaway. They can't really chase ya! 

GEORGE

He's actually doing him a favor. It's less money for him to buy food. 

HOYT

So they just stood there and did nothing? 

VOGEL

Yeah, nothing. Nothing! 

HOYT

No further questions. 

GEORGE

Hey! Great plane! Thanks a lot. Piece of junk. You know you almost got us killed! 

HOYT

Call Mabel Choate to the stand. 

BAILIFF

Call Mabel Choate. 

CHILES

Your Honor. I most strenuously and vigorously object to this witness. She was not present at the time of the incident. Her testimony is irrelevant, irrational, and inconsequential. 

HOYT

Your Honor, the prosecution has gone to great lengths and considerable cost to find these character witnesses.It is imperative that we establish this is not merely an isolated incident. It's part of a pattern of anti-social behavior that's been going on for years. 

VANDELAY

Objection overruled. I'll hear the witness. 

HOYT

Now, Mrs. Choate, would you please tell the court what happen the evening of January 4th. 

CHOATE

Well, I was in Snitzer's Bakery when I got accosted by that man. 

HOYT

Let the record show that she is pointing at Mr. Seinfeld. 

HOYT

What did he want? 

CHOATE

My marble rye. 

HOYT

Your marble rye? 

CHOATE

I got the last one. He kept persisting, and I said no. 

HOYT

And then you left the bakery. 

CHOATE

That's right. 

HOYT

But it didn't end there, did it, Mrs. Choate? 

CHOATE

Oh no. 

JERRY

Gimme that rye. 

CHOATE

Stop it. 

JERRY

I want that rye lady. 

CHOATE

Help - someone help. 

JERRY

Shut up, you old bag! 

HOYT

No further questions. 

HOYT

I call Marla Penny to the stand. 

BAILIFF

Call Marla Penny. 

JERRY

The virgin! 

HOYT

And what was your connection to the defendants? 

PENNY

I dated Mr. Seinfeld for several weeks in the autumn of 1992. 

HOYT

Then on the evening of October 28, there was an abrupt end to that relationship. Tell us what happened. 

PENNY

It's rather difficult to talk about. 

HOYT

It's alright. Take your time. 

PENNY

Well, I became aware of a - 

HOYT

A what? 

PENNY

A, uh - 

HOYT

Yes? 

PENNY

A contest. 

HOYT

Contest? 

PENNY

Yes. 

HOYT

What was the nature of the contest? 

PENNY

Oh please, I can't. 

HOYT

It's okay. 

PENNY

The four of them made a wager to see if they could - 

HOYT

Yes? 

PENNY

To see who could go the longest without gratifying themselves. 

PETERMAN

For the love of God! 

PENNY

It was horrible, horrible! 

HOYT

Call Donald Sanger to the stand. 

JERRY

Who the hell is that? 

SANGER

Come on Donald, you're doing fine. 

GEORGE

The Bubble Boy! 

CHILES

Bubble Boy? 

JERRY

That's right, the Bubble Boy. 

CHILES

What's a Bubble Boy? 

JERRY

He's a boy who lives in a bubble. 

BOY

What the hell are all you looking at? 

HOYT

So Donald, would you please tell the court about the incident that occurred in your house, October 7th, 1992. 

BOY

Well, Jerry Seinfeld was supposed to come to my house, but his friend Costanza showed up instead, so I challenged him to a game of Trivial Pursuit. 

GEORGE

Who invaded Spain in the Eighth Century? 

BOY

That's a joke - the Moors. 

GEORGE

Oh no - I'm so sorry, it's the Moops. The correct answer is the Moops. 

BOY

Moops? Let me see that. That's not Moops, you jerk. It's Moors. It's a misprint. 

GEORGE

Sorry, the card says Moops. 

BOY

It doesn't matter. It's Moors - there's no Moops. 

GEORGE

It's Moops. 

BOY

Moors! 

GEORGE

Moops! 

GEORGE

Help! Someone! 

BOY

There's no Moops, you idiot. 

SUSAN

Stop it! Let go of him! 

SANGER

Donald, stop it. No. Donald, stop it. 

GEORGE

It was Moops. 

BOY

Moors. 

HOYT

So Mr. Costanza parked in a handicapped spot, and as a result you got in an accident, and your wheelchair was destroyed? 

LADY

That's right. 

HOYT

And then Mr. Kramer gave you a used wheelchair? 

LADY

That's right. 

HOYT

So you were the doctor on duty the night Susan Ross died? 

WILCOX

Yes, that's right. It was May 16, 1996. I'll never forget it. 

HOYT

So you broke the news to Mr. Costanza? Could you tell the court, please, what his reaction was? 

WILCOX

I would describe it as restrained jubilation. 

ROSS

Murderer! 

ROSS

He killed our daughter! He knew those envelopes were toxic! 

VANDELAY

Order in this court! 

HOYT

Call Sidra Holland to the stand. 

CHILES

Whew! Look at this one, she fine. You dated her? 

HOYT

So you met Jerry Seinfeld in a health club sometime in 1993? 

SIDRA

Yes. 

HOYT

And you also met Miss Benes in that same health club? 

SIDRA

Yes, that's true. 

HOYT

Would you describe the circumstances of that meeting. 

SIDRA

We were in the sauna, making chit-chat. 

SIDRA

You know, I've seen you around the club. My name's Sidra. This is Marcie. 

ELAINE

Oh, hi, I'm Elaine. 

HOYT

So, she pretended to trip, and she fell into your breasts? 

SIDRA

Yes. 

HOYT

Why would she do something like that? 

SIDRA

Because he sent her in there to find out if they were real. 

HOYT

State your name. 

BOOKMAN

Bookman, Joe Bookman. 

HOYT

And what's your occupation? 

BOOKMAN

I'm a library cop. 

HOYT

What does a library cop do? 

BOOKMAN

We chase down library delinquents. 

HOYT

Anyone in this room ever delinquent? 

BOOKMAN

Yeah, he was. Right over there - Seinfeld. 

HOYT

How long was his book overdue? 

BOOKMAN

25 years. We don't call them delinquent after that long. 

HOYT

What do you call them? 

BOOKMAN

Criminals. 

HOYT

So you and Mr. Costanza were dating. 

WOMAN

Yes. 

HOYT

And then what happened? 

WOMAN

Well, I invited him to attend my son's birthday party and - 

GEORGE

Fire! Get out of the way! 

GUARD

At the time, I was employed as a security guard in the parking lot at the Garden Valley Shopping Mall. 

JERRY

Why would I do it unless I was in mortal danger? I know it's against the law. 

GUARD

I don't know. 

JERRY

Because I could get uromycitisis poisoning and die - that's why. 

HOYT

Uromycitisis! I wonder if they're having any trouble controlling themselves during this trial? Perhaps these two hooligans would like to have a pee party right here in the courtroom! 

CHILES

Objection, Your Honor! This is completely inappropriate! My clients' medical condition is not on trial here! I refer you to the Disability Act of 1990. 

VANDELAY

Sit down, Mr. Chiles. 

HOYT

Alright, Detective, then what happened? 

DETECTIVE

We got a tip that a lot of prostitutes had been turning tricks in the parking lot. 

PROSTITUTE

You just cost me some money. 

KRAMER

Cool it, lady. Cool it. Cool it, lady. Cool it. 

POLICE

Police officers - freeze right there! 

HOYT

So Cosmo Kramer was, in fact, a pimp. 

HOYT

So you asked Mr. Seinfeld if he would wear your puffy shirt on the Today Show? 

TALKER

(Mumbles) 

HOYT

Excuse me? 

CHILES

Uh, excuse me, Your Honor, but what is the point of this testimony? This woman's a low-talker. I can't hear a word she's saying. So either get some other kind of microphone up there, or let's move on. 

HOYT

Call George Steinbrenner to the stand. 

BAILIFF

Call George Steinbrenner. 

HOYT

So George Costanza came to work for you in May of 1994? 

STEINBRENNER

Yes, that's right, he was good kid - a lovely boy. Shared his calzone with me - that was a heck of a sandwich, wasn't it, Georgie? 

GEORGE

Yes, sir, that was a good sandwich, sir. 

STEINBRENNER

He had one little problem though. 

HOYT

What was that? 

STEINBRENNER

He was a communist. Thick as they come. Like a big juicy steak. 

FRANK

How could you give twelve million dollars to Hideki Irabu?! 

VANDELAY

Order! 

HOYT

Cock fighting? 

MARCELLINO

Cock fighting. 

PHARMACIST

Sponges. I don't mean the kind you clean your tub with. They're for sex. Said she needed a whole case of them. 

MAN

She exposed her nipple. 

HOYT

How did she try to kill you? 

PITT

She tried to smother me with a pillow. 

HOYT

Call Yev Kassem to the stand. 

BAILIFF

Call Yev Kassem. 

JERRY

Who? 

ELAINE

The Soup Nazi! 

CHILES

Soup Nazi? You people have a little pet name for everybody. 

HOYT

State your name. 

NAZI

Yev Kassem. 

HOYT

Could you spell that? 

NAZI

No! Next question. 

HOYT

How do you know the defendants? 

NAZI

They used to come to my restaurant. 

GEORGE

Medium turkey chili. 

JERRY

Medium crab bisque. 

GEORGE

I didn't get any bread. 

JERRY

Just forget it. Let it go. 

GEORGE

Um, excuse me, I think you forgot my bread. 

NAZI

You want bread? 

GEORGE

Yes, please. 

NAZI

Three dollars! 

GEORGE

What? 

NAZI

No soup for you! 

NAZI

But the idiot clowns did not know how to order. I banned that one - the woman - for a year. Then one day, she came back. 

ELAINE

Five cups chopped porcini mushrooms. Half a cup of olive oil. Three pounds celery. 

NAZI

That's my recipe for wild mushroom. 

ELAINE

You're through, Soup Nazi. Pack it up. No more soup for you. Next! 

NAZI

She published my recipes. I had to close the store, move to Argentina. She ruined my business! 

ELAINE

Soup's not all that good anyway. 

NAZI

What did you say?! 

HOYT

The state calls Mr. Babu Bhatt to the stand. 

JERRY

How did they find Babu? 

ELAINE

I thought he was deported. 

HOYT

You came a long way to be here today, haven't you? 

HOYT

And what's your connection to the defendant? 

HOYT

And then what happened? 

RIVERA

Hi everybody, I'm Geraldo Rivera and welcome to this special edition of Rivera Live. Well, arguments in the Good Samaritan trial ended today. The jury has been in deliberation for four and a half hours now. Let's go live to Jane Wells who is in Latham, Massachusetts, covering this trial for us. Jane - 

WELLS

Geraldo, just a few minutes ago, the jury asked to see the video tape. 

RIVERA

That's the one where they are overheard making sarcastic remarks during the robbery. 

WELLS

Yes, it's a very incriminating piece of evidence. But I must tell you, Geraldo, this courtroom and everyone who has attended this trial is still reeling from the endless parade of witness who have come forth so enthusiastically to testify against these four seemingly ordinary people. One even had the feeling that if Judge Vandelay didn't finally put a stop to it, it could've gone on for months. 

RIVERA

Jane, whose testimony do you think resonated most strongly with this jury? 

WELLS

That is so hard to say. Certainly there's the doctor with the poison invitations. The Bubble Boy was an extremely sympathetic and tragic figure. And that bizarre contest certainly didn't sit well with this small town jury.There's the woman they sold the defective wheelchair to, the deported Pakistani restaurateur. Geraldo, it just went on, and on, and on, into the night. 

RIVERA

And so we wait. 

JERRY

Do they make you wear uniforms in prison? 

ELAINE

I think so. 

JERRY

It's not that bright orange one is it? 

ELAINE

I hope it's not that one, because I cannot wear orange. 

KRAMER

Will you stop worrying? Jackie's going to get us off. He never loses. How about when he asked that cop if a black man had ever been to his house. Did you see the look on his face? 

ESTELLE

Sorry to bother you, Judge. 

VANDELAY

How did you get in here? 

ESTELLE

Please, if he's found guilty, please be kind to him. He's a good boy. 

VANDELAY

This is highly irregular. 

ESTELLE

Well, maybe there's something I can do for you. 

VANDELAY

What do you mean? 

ESTELLE

You know 

SIDRA

Oh, Jackie, you're so articulate. 

CHILES

We have plenty of time, too. This jury could be out for days. 

CHILES

Hello? Damn. They're ready. 

JERRY

Hey Elaine, what was it you were about to say to me on the plane when it was going down? 

ELAINE

I've always loved ... United Airlines. 

KRAMER

I think it's going to be okay - that girl just smiled at me. 

JERRY

Maybe because she knows you're going to jail. 

BAILIFF

All rise. 

VANDELAY

Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a verdict? 

FOREMAN

We have, Your Honor. 

VANDELAY

Will the defendants please rise. And how do you find, with respect to the charge of criminal indifference? 

FOREMAN

We find the defendants - guilty. 

VANDELAY

Order! Order in this court, I will clear this room! I do not know how, or under what circumstances the four of you found each other, but your callous indifference and utter disregard for everything that is good and decent has rocked the very foundation upon which our society is built. I can think of nothing more fitting than for the four of youto spend a year removed from society so that you can contemplate the manner in which you have conducted yourselves. I know I will. This court is adjourned. 

GEORGE

You had to hop! You had to hop on the plane. 

ELAINE

Puddy, don't wait for me. 

PUDDY

Alright. 

FRANK

We gotta get out of here. We want to beat the traffic. 

SIDRA

Come on, Jackie. Let's go. 

JERRY

What? 

CHILES

Oh, and by the way, they're real, and they're spectacular. 

JERRY

Well, it's only a year. That's not so bad. We'll be out in a year, and then we'll be back 

KRAMER

Could be fun. Don't have to worry about your meals, or what you're going to do Saturday night. And they do shows. Yeah, we could put on a show - maybe 'Bye Bye Birdie' or 'My Fair Lady'. Elaine, you could be Liza Doolittle. 

ELAINE

Why don't you just blow it out your a... 

ELAINE

If I call Jill from prison, do you think that would make up for the other ones? 

JERRY

Sure. 

ELAINE

Cause you only get one call. The prison call is like the king of calls. 

JERRY

I think that would be a very nice gesture. 

KRAMER

I got it - it's out! How about that, huh? Oh, boy, what a relief. 

JERRY

See now, to me, that button is in the worst possible spot. 

GEORGE

Really? 

JERRY

Oh yeah. The second button is the key button. It literally makes or breaks the shirt. Look at it, it's too high, it's in no-man's land. 

GEORGE

Haven't we had this conversation before? 

JERRY

You think? 

GEORGE

I think we have. 

JERRY

Yeah, maybe we have. 

JERRY

So what is the deal with the yard? I mean when I was a kid my mother wanted me to play in the yard. But of course she didn't have to worry about my next door neighbor Tommy sticking a shiv in my thigh. And what's with the lockdown? Why do we have to be locked in our cells? Are we that bad that we have to be sent to prison, in prison? You would think the weightlifting and the sodomy is enough. So, anyone from Cellblock D? 

JERRY

I'll talk slower. I'm kidding - I love Cellblock D. My friend George is in Cellblock D. What are you in for,sir? 

JERRY

Murder one? Oooooo, watch out everybody. Better be nice to you. I'm only kidding sir - lighten up. How about you, what are you in for? 

JERRY

Grand theft auto - don't steal any of my jokes. 

JERRY

Hey, I don't come down to where you work, and knock the license plate out of your hand. 

GUARD

Alright, Seinfeld, that's it. Let's go. Come on. 

JERRY

Alright, hey, you've been great! See you in the cafeteria.
